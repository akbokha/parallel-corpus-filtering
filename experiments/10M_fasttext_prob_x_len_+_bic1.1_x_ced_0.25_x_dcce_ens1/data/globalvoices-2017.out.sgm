<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely big.</seg>
<seg id="4">"as many of my generation I also grew up with American films, I have read American music, American authors and run his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"indeed, this country had a profound profound effect on me, that I was mainly journalist because of an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"when 14 years old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura student coed the murderous conspiracy of a oil magnate who were fostering his interest to occupy his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was trapped.</seg>
<seg id="8">"freely to Method Man," I was like that the absolute truth is, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year that I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the US had only strengthened."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said:" America is the only country in which I ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be who you are, and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very blackish love story about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written on the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes with his bothernia.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never keeps behind the mountain as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he tells exactly what he thinks about how a former colleague express it, and openly explains his contempt for Muslims, Latino, AfroAmericans and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless people have reacted to his statements and voted in flocks for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes, which he won with the republican elections, was the highest number ever reached by the party nominations."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support these bigothelper person asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not bring Trump and his electorate with people who I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, my Professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of journalism, the people from around the world record, a deeply unbelieving person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Trumps Welview was not agreed with that of Peter Bhatia, the present publisher of" "Cincinnati Inquirer". ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent a lot of hours to watch the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps Intolerant anz is also in contrast to the generosity that I lived with Sandy Bahr, who fought for her life for the environment and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she still fits her with the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentor, whose wise advice helped me much with my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those through them are rooted in my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump did his way to the nominees presidential elections, they offered me a halt and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016, more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, in spite of - or perhaps precisely because of its contempt for non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"dealing with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared its racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to overlook these things, leaving me nearly the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump-voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to arrange people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">"this is superficial and respectful, and suggests a inability to understand those who act in a different way and think."</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, of which most white are tuned for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might want to say that they are still important in America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who commented the cruel decision to raise a man who look down with contempt on those who look different from contempt on those who look different."</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "Whitelash" "(m.).: so much as the dissertation of the whites against all other ethnicities, as much as Schleukins, as it did the great Van Jones, has exactly what America has done so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you might have always, America is always welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country has chosen as its president, twice the son of an Kenyans, whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"however, with the choice of Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of the white America of that promise, saying: hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is back in the rudder, say it."</seg>
<seg id="46">"with all that I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a vocabulary with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, my son, Captain Humayun Kahn would have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>

<seg id="53">"no!" they said.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they called them and their voices were louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"would anyone who is not like you, have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and silken "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan completed with the words:" "God is thanks to Mr. Trump, that's not your America." "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son fell, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps Land," said the message. "</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and team work can fight against illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing fought.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practised solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication is done by an agreement with Global Voices for the common use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known that this ship had already been driven by illegal fishing in illegal fishing, before it sought the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">"the East African countries were accordingly uplifted and little tilted, to welcome a law of these kinds at their coasts."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized rapidly against the ship. they refused to share one of their ports and refuse to give him a fishing village."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by lands that you simply did everything", "Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan fisheries authority. he is part of a team that discovered the ship at once and followed."</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not possible to catch them there.</seg>
<seg id="105">"in the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia due to pillage of the fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NGO Stop illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries stop)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"the members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries that were driven out of their waters at that time."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" with this, we have eight countries that are like-minded and working together. they exchange information and stand up each other when it comes to illegal fishing, "" says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught, hidden in what it is extremely difficult to trace. so, the illegal fishing is a main cause of overfishing of regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"by deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can cause a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing once were hindered by bureaucratic obstacles and also through the snowflabouo, with the information in different countries, the actions now occur in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"the individual countries can communicate with each other for example lists of existing licenses, news on evaporating activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a longshore specting."</seg>
<seg id="113">"Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea, using satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows to mark the authorities to mark ships that fish in bottted areas - such as those who indicate that a ship invites its captured fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a canned royalty, where they were traveling and possibly also whether they have a penal blister."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing, may then refuse the adoption of such ships in their ports. what means that the ships can not sell their charge, and that they could even be forced to numbers penalties, such as in the case of the Prime Minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it then goes to considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing catch is not worth more."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, leading director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to gain by estimated 20 million USD to lost sales, which will lose eight members of the network HISH-i each year due to the illegal fishermen who invade in East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East-Africa has one of the most productive tuna fissurgeries that attracts the region of commercial fishing from around the world. among these also these illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include actions like sailing under false flag, fake license papers, indication of fantasies, the fish protected species and the fishing in protected areas."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they specifically take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non-complete control system," "says Long." "earlier, a ship could be illegal and a country could then say 'You darling my harbor."</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say 'Come to me'." "and precisely this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now."</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front operates.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its foundation FISH-i was involved in more than 30 studies of suspects ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has uncovered criminal networks, which had spread counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered vessels that used several fraudulent identities and found it volatile ships and found."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks organised crime," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">"he builds a system that is intended to help FISH-i, suspicious ships precise."</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which has always been developed, will also help to trace the illegal ships that are happy to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position, "" says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships, for example, can switch off their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be terminated by satellite."</seg>
<seg id="135">"therefore, Copeland helps to build a system that connects various information on each other. it is supposed to help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch with Google and the sea protection organization Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be viewed through the position of each traceable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" together with the neighbors, to get a better picture of what is doing - it simply gives sense, "" he says. "" here is a chance for countries to unite and bundle their resources for investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global level." "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run, in which a global system allows the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only criminals, but also deterred."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships that were formerly without a license and barely expected to reckon with consequences, now know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating at FISH-i participated in a 33% increase in fisheries sales, since then fishing boats have more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i, Somalia had helped to play Greko 1 on board, the inspectors found there on board towing networks, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars disappear by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015, six countries joined together in 2015, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight against illegal fishing, according to the same model like FISH-i." "With Security is the goal, even more such initiatives and structures to arise in other regions," says Copeland. "</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member state could report its first major triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship that was travelling under false flag. and not only was the ship used without a license and were not allowed to be prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also imbued in botene waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the take of measures to Greko 1 put it a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing," says Bergh. "</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time evidence that such special, collaborative effort is functioning on the oceans of the oceans. Emma Bryce is freelance journalism and lives in London. there she writes about the environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="233">Everything about it was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a little wrapped in a blanket, and commanded me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big clump silver."</seg>
<seg id="235">This day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were picked up and held me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>

<seg id="238">"I jumped in and saw a couch, on the human being tortured."</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field-bed and metal-feathers.</seg>

<seg id="248">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>

<seg id="254">I decided "Why did you put me down?"</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this because my father told me at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">Beside La cuadra there were several rooms that were referred to as offices.</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero there a man collapsed and killed.</seg>

<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number assigned as part of the process of dehumanisation.</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the arrangement of up was that they should be moved."</seg>

<seg id="276">I just don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">"I was also officer of the gendarmerie and I would never like to penetrate into a house, and to steal it all in it."</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">Once he called me a criminals and I replied: and you who stalks cars on the street?</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a crime?</seg>
<seg id="281">"he exploded before anger, struck me and screamed:"</seg>

<seg id="288">"at that time, the defense, a co-conspirators had been to be with this crime. I have no problem, they can lay down to me what they wanted."</seg>

<seg id="301">"I guess it was just decided to kill these people, but why their corpses disappear?"</seg>

<seg id="308">Only to clarify: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I was even at the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just said the truth about 20 criminals -- including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">"the thought, show my Father, arose during a conversation, when he was under house arrest."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to translating, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the starting text and to transfer an active language skills to transfer it into the language language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that is the case with native language, in general, the belief that translators should be in the language of the language - not in the language language - native language."</seg>
<seg id="379">Thus it should translate one French speakers for example from English into French - not from the French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as a mother tongue, who could make translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of the survival, cost-reasons, or the relatively small number of English speakers that can learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies, who have no foreign employees, can still use translations of company-internally. then, the Japanese staff, whose Englishly become the best ones, to translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the confused and mysterious sentences arise through machine-related translations, show that this technique can still not replace a human translator for a long time. this applies to some languages very special."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling reprints, often used t-shirts or pockets, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood."</seg>

<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable to as jewelry or at least harmless. but of large companies or the government that have the funds to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations."</seg>

<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi Prefecture, Prefecture, Prefecture, Prefecture, the Prefecture of Japan had to experience the earthquake and the resulting tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring prefecture of Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated because the tsunami had let whole coastal cities disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">"even more to this, Fukushima Prefecture lived a nuclear accident, already alone, 160 000 inhabitants had already had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from local perspective which progress has been achieved six years after the life of the local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes statistics from the Japanese re-construction authorities as well as poll results for those affected by themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"housing construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reported that until December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the scheduled subdivisions (according to the presence of Fukushima, Miyagi, and Iwate were finished in the Prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate."</seg>
<seg id="552">"the biggest success among the three Prefectures could record Miyagi, here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate 75 per cent of such houses is finished, whereas Fukushima is a total of 70 percent with 70 percent."</seg>
<seg id="554">"however, it is still possible to resettlement six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by Behelfswald (who), casetsu juutaku) in final substitutions."</seg>
<seg id="555">"according to the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in subjectivity."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016 still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such Behausungen."</seg>
<seg id="557">"nearly 40 percent of 2011 evacuated from Fukushima still live in notebooks, whereas Miyagi was more successful at Miyagi. more than 75 per cent of the evacuees, which are explored after the disaster in Behelfswald, have been relocated to final houses."</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number is here at 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected Prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine 1074 of 1100 schools that were affected by misfortune, its doors opened until December 2016, which constitutes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three Prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">"six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three preftures are much more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="562">"while almost 100 per cent of fisheries are now in operation in Iwate and Miyagi, in Fukushima only 30 percent of fisheries are rerecorded."</seg>
<seg id="563">"the tsunami and the atomic accident, have drawn up in the three prefecture of agricultural land large-sized in co-workers."</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of arable land in Iwate and less than 50 percent of the arable land in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed arable land of Fukushima, are in the" nuclear clusal area. ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three Prefectures, tourism has recovered again and again Fukushima remains a long way back."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are again at 90 percent on the same level as of the misfortune. Fukushima, however, can only 75 percent be found here."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reported that since the catastrophe almost half of the coast inhabitants, it was more difficult to feel a living."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"to determine the picture, the paper conducted numerous surveys under the native population and among the evacuation centres. she asked her about the state of reconstruction and also how its sensation has changed compared to the tsunami risk."</seg>
<seg id="571">In its introduction of the article explains the Kahoku Shimpo-Newspaper:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to find out more about the tsunami consciousness under the native population of experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">"the survey carried out that 83.1 percent of the local residents, measures have taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis."</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55,9 per cent of respondents said that still not enough in matters of disasters have been done."</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is for those who had to evacuated from Fukushima Prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="576">"in its edition on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo-Newspaper has directed its attention to the situation of evacuated from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima still had to experience the enormous earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima Prefecture, was also a witness of the worst, catastrophic, atomic disorder, the Japan ever had to experience."</seg>
<seg id="578">"of 160 000 evacuees from Fukushima almost 63 000 people were moved into areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016 something more than 23 000 people had been converted back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after the date of 2017, 40 000 inhabitants live from Fukushima off their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the catastrophic areas, most of the evacuation centres have been older than 50 years old. they have to be returned in proper homes because the efforts are competing for reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects. here it is a construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo."</seg>

<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities in sugar mills were lahmated.</seg>
<seg id="629">"after the earth, the sugar industry stood still in the region and the factory lost after and after its facilities, until only the rumours of steel and concrete remained."</seg>

<seg id="641">The old railway line of the municipality already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugars industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar-products were technically dated and almost competitive they were unsustainable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">"the initial idea was to concentrate on the production of the most efficient plants, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories that can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs which led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar plantations and the rise rise in the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar price came back over a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">"from 2017 through 2025, the price of unrefined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 published report" "agricultural brochure" "by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations and Food Organisation of the United Nations."</seg>

<seg id="720">The customers see these plastic dishes and then decide whether they set the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"Kappabashi district, there are a variety of these small companies that produce just those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic dishes are usually such a thing that they do not even create them once more. a new trend is transformed into showy cell accessories and other gadgets."</seg>

<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"is there anyone who would say:" wow, cool, now I can install my mobile phone with salmon-oestrogen?. "</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic stores can also take a less appealable form to surprise for example colleagues or family members uncomfortable.</seg>

<seg id="752">"behind every body, behind every bone fund in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories paid, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose sores may never heal."</seg>
<seg id="753">"therefore the Mexican news portal is called Animal Político, the digital project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" with drug trafficking "), to give these sacrifice a voice and stories of people who were told in the battle between law enforcement agencies and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project as follows:</seg>

<seg id="771">"you stand out of the insurance of my Father, but they don't get paid, because that demand an exchange of death."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get it? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and state management."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some extracts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a lesbian of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in Central Asia."</seg>

<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent to it or consider this as normal.</seg>

<seg id="785">"no, it is not normal that my 10 year old cousin thinks that he is Narco (German: drug dealers) will, if it is great. and it is not normal that people hear songs about the" heroism "of the offenders if they go through roads."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, this is as if they mocks those who have lost someone and those who are afraid of doing so something like that."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories appear to mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The insomnia of the people is unbelievable for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village can be justified that they were "</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they are trying to conceive that they will be spared from such tragedies, if they are not stirring and silent."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post" four months of blackmail in the main city district: like a family with drugations, it describes how the armed criminals were blacked for month money from their business until the end of not only the business was destroyed, but also their family apart.

<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, because you do not know when they will lead you or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I asked myself in these terrible days if wines would dissolve my deep rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega released the article "The Unforgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: one of the proposed generation of violence.</seg>
<seg id="800">"in the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?"</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is an orphan and he tells that he had to teach yourself how to make an egg cooks, potatoes bres, tortillas warm and" Chichi "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the surface with water, sugar and dairy powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - inexpressible for a boy for all the life of violence and had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood has been past two years earlier, when he saw only a few blocks away from his home, who saw bloody sores of his father being shot by armed men from a pre-propelled car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"when Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence caused by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world based on the number of murder for public safety and government of the United States Government."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the Prosecution said 3103 Morde. this corresponds to the average 8.5 Morden per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">"these are just a few of hundreds of stories, which leaves the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country."</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories live on to the face of ever new headlines. but this project reminds us of those that we must not forget.</seg>

<seg id="1137">"for Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the count of stories in their original language is a possible response to that."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"global Voices reported short about another initiative of Steven Bird, the unbridgeable Blog."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"however, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to get the language variety of great cities and to appreciate."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia, or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already carried out events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born children."</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project are:</seg>
<seg id="1142">"mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we manage cities to assume diversity - secure spaces, where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong to."</seg>
<seg id="1143">"while" listening is often associated with it, "" those events instead listen to "" the listeners to feel, to feel, to make. "</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format historical storyteller presents their story first in their own language and translate or explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not professional storytellers, they lead their devotion and their account to that the listeners should be involved."</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">"for example, the following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou is also the opportunity to explain the stories of typical customs of narrative for their country."</seg>
<seg id="1148">In a different event John Nyamusara tells the Fabel of the hares and baboons in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"after he explains the meaning of his Fabel, John Nyamusara is asked:" how is this to speak to an audience that does not understand your language? "with a wide grin, he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:"</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">You were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">"so far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. all who are inspired by the project can contact TLS in order to organize their own storyteller."</seg>

<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the junction of numerous civilizations and here merge Greek-roman architectural types with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would place all that architecture that not only represents the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">"this strip train into the digital archeology and conservation has created a time-capsule, which will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future."</seg>

<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call its name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English with me even when he was already in prison.</seg>

<seg id="1218">Bassel opened me the gate to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>

<seg id="1255">Mozambique has responded with wrath to a corruption drop in which a government member returned after half of his prison sentence in the state apparatus by which the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment with four other defendants (about 800 000 Euro) to 22 years imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money was made from public funds from Mozambique to Mosambique from the Council of Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately requested his re-setting into the company, which took place on 19 April."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with an opinion of the General Council of the Republic, which had filed an application, there would be no obstacles to Cambaza, to refer back to its old post, as the company does not fully implement disciplinarity according to his detention."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many inhabitants do not welcome the action well."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"the Centre for Public integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, a local institution dedicated to public transparency, sentenced in an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to restore the director:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clearly identifies the lack of transparency and is even a regression in terms of the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we need to take note is that the company should have a disciplinarity against the contrasting characters.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"however, the firm seems to be a reasonable legal steps for applying the appropriate functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, reject this behavior as well as" wardly ":"</seg>

<seg id="1267">"he could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could be advised and polishing his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he has agreed to reintegrate into the company that he helped harm."</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is happy to be silent for his silence.</seg>

<seg id="1273">"Cambaza lacks morals to return and serve the state, * he had already a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead he only serves the state itself."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state, as handes it became an inexhaustible money source and the state itself has become tired of this man, which was charged before and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence."</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocked the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users to injustice</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar PAE" means Kicherse or Spage.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo of Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar the well known Social Network took their posts from the net because it contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people ostindian origin or generally used as an adjective" Indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or" "May" "in Burmical writing) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma into the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise of radically nationalistic movements given the word an extremely valuable connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word which is most commonly used by Ultra-nationalist as a hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight at Al-Hasish language in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar'mag is usually associated with racism, but the word itself is not automatically calling for hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also Posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed in the purpose of his use."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings which have the same character sequence as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair is written on Burmesic also called 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar PAE' (Spage axis), 'Kalar OAT' (Kamel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The facebookuses Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he had asked his friends on a spiritual way whether it could be shaking how he could alleviate his back pain, by doing a vocabulary."</seg>
<seg id="1302">The set ku la - "healing" (ku) + the fragment (la) on Burmisch - resembles the racist expression very but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"in Win, the opinion is that it will reduce hate speech from radically nationalists, but also emphasised that Facebook analytical must be analytical before it all posts extinguishing in suspicion of racism, racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">"the automatic dism will not understand, what you write to Facbeook."</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should do instead, is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the words."</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar PAE" (Spaged).</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that these three-minute nationalists, who spread hate speech, have received quite a good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">"now it is time to circumcised their nationalism."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to everyone, the relationship-hate language may not be spread for a long time, the efficiency of this strategy may not hold long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords often become a Katz- and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative way of writing the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">Author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to clear his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' has been banished from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I became aware of this new directive on Facebook, I made a post office to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post office was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited by the liken, post and sharing of content for 24 hours because of the post" "Facebook community standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts of people who have no negative intentions or that simply try to show their opinions against the hate-speaking nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:"</seg>
<seg id="1319">Mail without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post the author shared his mind about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative to ask for example the Burmese Internet community for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intention to diminish racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words lead to censored only even more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">It seems as if they have started it without a local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as "chair" or "inheritance curry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they have made mistakes, they did not attempt to correct the pounded posts deleted."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only slightly greater respect for the 15 million benefits, making them a big turnover, that would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has taken care of much spott among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now make funny and write the word" Kalar "not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are removed from the net."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that have no incitement, but nevertheless removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">With permission to use.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the Burmese text reads" "I want to sit on a chair and watch peas curry and watch a Indian film."</seg>
<seg id="1332">"just to try out whether Facebook is the post office, which contains the word Kalar."</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot with permission to use.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"the post says" If you are a doctor, do you heal people? "</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot with permission to use.</seg>
<seg id="1336">"in the last five years, extreme nationalistic ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to extend their voices and their influence."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech in social networks have to be heightened in addition to violence in Myanmar, especially in the fields of Rakhine, where disputes between Moslems and Buddhists have forced thousands to escape."</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticized for his failure to criticise the disharpening hate speech on his Burmese sites under control.</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but instead of simply putting the word 'Kalar', it would be better running, more likely to have focused on the context than on Code focused initiatives and learned from them."</seg>

<seg id="1345">"before this change of the Act, some members of Hindu and Muslim denominations took place in practice, and in May 2016, the leader of the inter-religious organization (IRO), a group, representatives of the various religious groups of the country gathered that the state did not interfere with that, age does not determine the maturity."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago has been a contractual partner of the UN Children's illegal Convention, the minority of minors than, every man under the age of 18."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"statistics show that the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who were married to 15 in Trinidad and Tobago 2,8 per cent, and with 18 they were 8.1 percent."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in 2011, the statistical centre of the country confirmed that from 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys under 19 were married."</seg>

<seg id="1351">"a Hindu leaders, for example, had no concerns to say the critic of the children's toe, they should remember, damn't care for their own affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"this kind of religious opposition assed for tensions in this actually uncomplicated matter, and at some point there were doubts on whether the opposition would not all agree with the bill."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"at the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided against the children of children - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, which could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law."</seg>
<seg id="1354">"now, only the president of the country must agree and proclaim the law."</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave us a state-update on Facebook which Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram again posted:</seg>

<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform used all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralised peer-to-peer network (i.e. computer machine connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult."</seg>

<seg id="1480">They reported how this clubs was created a safe place for these women and they simultaneously have made an ambassador for change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini had shown in its discussion, was the case of women who have not called their husbands on behalf of their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem that the women could easily identify with.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"not to speak according to the names of their husbands, there is a bread that they all maintain all over and never put into question."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini writes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testified that a woman respected her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not hold this is seen as a husk and as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never done thoughts on this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini wanted to try to try her husband in the name until now, at home, as it is running."</seg>

<seg id="1493">"with this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started its first discussion."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" Patriarchate "before. some believed it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women."</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the videoprojection, the women tried to bring the discussion with a practice."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked everyone," If we could not tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, does that mean they do not respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it be equivalent to it? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when she brought the name of her husbands on the lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the break of a centuries-old tradition, in which women never allowed to speak the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy that she just sat down during the whole exercise; another decided to let the whole desired frustration against him and his family, by cursed him."</seg>

<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"even in adrenalintoxication about, having broken with an ancient bread, the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to name their husbands on behalf."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days Rohini got a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put the woman in his head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner prior to the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law she died, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," "Rohini said, I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">"a husband of a participant in was less understanding, and the situation was composed of violence."</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the galvanberred point on the forehead, which indicates the Ehestate:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women just need to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would wear a red spot if he was doing it too."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I heard about wearing him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not ended completely with it, but they mean they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it on some days."</seg>

<seg id="1522">In the last few months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and talked about things that they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have already made some things, for example how our identities are bound to our husbands, have never been so honest."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say certain things loud, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion-round we talk about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have been carried out in the group since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most of them this is okay, but some wanted a salad-curta, a wide shirt above a pants, wearing; they have not drunk."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much argument and discussion about the advantages of their own wardrobe, morals associated with the Saris and much more, smuggled Rohini had their own pair of course (Upper shirts) into a panel discussion so that the women could carry them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next have they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will be able to create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"the question, whether in the five months have already been a bit changed since their first discussion, confirms Rohini that things slowly get into roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then stopped to say the name of their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, included, make it still, but only if they are alone and are not members of the family members."</seg>
<seg id="1535">"only one or two will continue to tell the name of their husbands, only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred on their forehead."</seg>

<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"but in this club, each of us gives us confidence that something will change."</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman in the club goes home and other people are reported what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>

<seg id="1898">"on the path of migrants, across Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I visited one of these places in the mexican city of Tapachula, he is located at the border to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is guided by a 59- year-old Mexican, a small woman with a corals pink glasses-frame and gold colored earrings in Teddy Bears."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"she is called the Concepción González Ramírez, and grew up in Tapachula. nevertheless, they know many under the name of Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel does not have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2,50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with grinding, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - still hundreds of African and Haitian migrants are here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, MS Ramírez, people get in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast start to call it:" Mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you mum Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outside on cardboard boxes."</seg>
<seg id="1912">It does not want to reject any one.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," "he answers with a smile." "I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">"Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to go to Boston to find his husband and the three children."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"you have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to take one first stop in South America and then move towards north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a well known name on the track, "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells me that Haitians and Africans often travel the route and that Africans were already talking to WhatsApp by Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet has lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker for construction of the Olympic Games and the soccer world championship."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaken, he began his trip to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">For months he has been guest at Mama Africa: he sells SIM card to save the necessary money to buy the bucket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will get in touch with Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again," he answers smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells you their guests often send their text messages if they have gone to grasping them or to tell you about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She declares that her Christian faith was the propulsion of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she does not know much about Africa, but her guests have brought her to cook chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Ms. Ramírez is perhaps very well known, but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>

<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that the Bustible to numerous African migrants are to be sold expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he has offered them his house for a dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitian."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on blankets on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking center outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests do through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he tells. "I experienced what they experience."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we have suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after he lived for three years, he was instructed after a raid on his working site from the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants who travels through Tapachula comes from Central America, and other residents also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he was flown in Honduras with his wife and his three children who wanted to blackmaze him out of him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he was asked for an accommodation and a unknown, an singles out, has offered him its roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later the family lives still there, and she tries to decide where the next steps should go."</seg>

<seg id="1952">In the courses the travelers will consult their telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests a large part from Somalia.</seg>

<seg id="2092">"the photo was recorded by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time in the morning; sometimes he slows down to his canvas, times to his computer, and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine to discover.</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives in the upper floor of his family house, which had been among them in 1967; the year, in which Israel did its occupation of the West Bank to flee from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as felimyeen (e.g.: farmers)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years Hdaib has been a impassioned activist, facing the conservative majority and questioned their well-proven opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression by art and rapies."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, who often deal with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian murders, he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are found not only in his hometown of Amman relevance, but also in cities that range from Damascus to Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited by borders, and he can also feel according to his own statement by the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not openly admit it, he hears a special issue to American foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war areas to do anything with his identity as a" Palestinian winged "of the second generation - even if he was born in Jordan, and has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I do not think of my own life circumstances," says Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I am a man, "while in water solves Nescafé on two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during that time it is planned for Muslims from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during the Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Hdaib has a certain weakness for it to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand has a cup of coffee in a sensing hot Junitag little with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically talk the sleeved of hot coffee and the crests of kent cigarette in the nose in the first place of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially if you have a look into the neighboring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to avoid basic things - as drinking in the public during the Ramadan water - to not land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Ministry of Jordaniens has told the appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliamentary elections, which support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontsgers Hamed Sinno, speaks of the cultural and traditional standards of the country, and the main reason for the concert."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the MP and former press briefing in the Islamic coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN, that the concert was" "straight" "because of the sexual orientation of the singer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Syrian spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world may be more dangerous activism which represents the old and proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement Mashrou'Leila the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," which continues to be campaigning for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement may not be simple rhetoric, but actually a clear crystalline reality reflected in Jordan, which appears to be clear in Hdaibs."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib traditional gender equity to glue by having his vision formed by the fate of Arab women who have imagined sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the image shows the skeleton of a apparently ill-settled woman, whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red sea; perhaps the blood of the countless women who lost their lives by the hands of those, who actually should trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past years Jordan has increased the number of "Honmorde" in Jordan - the unofficial outside left.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to the UN Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary nations achieved their peak in 2016; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure in order to support the women, the victims of killing or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on interruption of control from the year 1954, women who are exposed to risk of internal violence, and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort, and the guarantee on the part of the family is needed that the woman has nothing to happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs's music also enjoys great popularity and is also known to get back to issues that are long considered tabu in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib contests that his work is political, however, is that he puts his music, the full explicit touching of sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot be separated from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"I became aware of politics," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and "Ghareeb" is the focus on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs, which are politically politically, can be continued."</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated many times:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which, in its words," what one wants "" - be it's faith or non-belief, heterosexuality or homosexuality. "</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noticed that there are hardly anyone in Jordan on the rights of gay people and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still heavily censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordian online program ROYA to notice that his comment has been torn out of the context, twisted and his opinion were censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only a revised version," says he. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib supports the arabic LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance of homosexuals does not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentioned Abu nudes, a poet of the eighth century, which is still in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks for himself: if Abu Nuten, who should work later on behalf of the caliphs, was able to write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the actual problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hashemial Kingdom, nothing new is that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news service took place several former government officials and members of the teacher's association, with the reason that they have expressed critical about the problems that were rooted in the country with deep in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in the face of this, the concert Hdaibs opinion is according to the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring a structural change in the next generation of Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has forged Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row but the path of progress - it looks for slow, oppressive and inner changes. it is certain that these changes are from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"in the end, Hdaib dreams, as millions of other Arabs also dreams, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of being able to bring his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region is characterized by the help of music, art and literature of a real and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, disputes and artificial species. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until it is ready, Hdaib will continue and therefore also resist resistance."</seg>

<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one is thought that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually also recorded in August in many areas of Tohocus. another theory states that the strongholds, the drums and dancing over more than one thousand years come up in the northeast, to force the Indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to the knees."</seg>

<seg id="2168">"El Callao, Perus most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where road-consuming and illegal drugs are commonplace."</seg>

<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, the appearance and hence the quirky hairstyles of famous sportsmen like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has resulted in the experienced hands of hairdressers to form these elaborate hair styles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme boundaries of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been held since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"there are experts from each other to show, who can create from them the eccentric Looks, as you can see in the following video (further videos on current competitions are available at the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos)."</seg>

<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the modified version of the fee "love botships to guerrilla warfare" which has published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The post is published as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love briefs to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not yet much more important, people who feel expelled, affection."</seg>
<seg id="2185">"just this question went out to the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga, from the Young Laartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation), young people to write guerrilla warfare."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"recently, her country was the venue of a historic event, and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement of FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces in Colombia), which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"international was considered to be the signating of the peace treaty, as significant that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos received for its merits to Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, in front of the columbians, there is still a long way to speak from a real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla warfare who have lived in illegal camps for many years and wore their arms around the clock, must now integrate into the lives as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society in turn, who had accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases profound hatred towards guerrilla warfare, it must now support its ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would join together and would have had to help integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that is exactly what they did: until now thousands young people wrote letters - love botships to former guerrilla fighters in order to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The target of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla warfare - which are to be handed in personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for atonement was created at the world summit of the Nobel Peace Prize winner who took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there were Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to talk shortly with Kailash Satyarthi to whom 2014 was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this declared that we love the people who love to write, on Valentine's Day of love's letters, but those who need them much more unnecessary."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he's plane, he told his love to share his love with people that was most urgent."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"thus, the plan to write songs full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now find their place in society and build up a new life." the letters are showing that the Colombian society is ready to make discourse about a common history of peace, "they say."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2000 letters have been collected within the framework of the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major towns of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I'd never thought that someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were passed on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the region of Caldono Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students of the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation Bogotlists entered the camp to communicate the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC emerged as they had done before in order to receive the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they did not receive commands, but letters full of shelter from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it's incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between, "told the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience so:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we passed the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of the guerilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" "Cambuches" "(a kind of hut where the guerrilla warfare) saw, I saw a guerrilla warfare, who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down, because in addition to him on the bed was a MGL-garnet, a deadly weapon in the thorn shutter."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"I still spoke to him and asked," "Hello, what do they say?" "he answered," "I replied to a letter that someone wrote to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeless letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"I have never written anything like this in my life, so I replied to it." "I suddenly ran the tears over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I reimpoverished him completely and set me next to the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry, sorry, all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter was to be, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to the FARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers in front of the hunger-tod. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now, I know that there is a society out there that is waiting with open arms to us."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I only learned how to handle weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"for the start, students and some leaders of the FARC came together to a panel discussion."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC were already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organisation, their ideals, and gave an insight into their views about the peace process:" for many years we have experienced the social injustice from the State to the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to build us into a political party, we can help to create society in this country. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a goal of this magnitude it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "said one of them."</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"those people who have never found hearing had never found hearing, and to recognize that the people I have often seen as monsters and had learned, even people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their life circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality, in which the land lives, does me hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforted me that all men - even those who have been killed, and so much damage, can give us something and a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, Commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">Columbians was prophesied by that after the disarmament peace would rule peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to reach the weapons to protest and protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"from the FARC we now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore, we call upon all defender of peace - regardless of which race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifice, because we know from own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way, there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2245">But the threat that is like a Damounted to over the local LGBTQ congregation is not only created overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">"OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual wife from Grosny, who had shared some of their experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has won the international headlines after several months ago, after reports published, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">"the first report was published by the journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaya Gazeta; she cast a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities, suspicious queer men, and they were hidden in secret prisons in Argun."</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a Transwoman, was born in Grosny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">Even since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when it was grown, you became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for them, which is why they moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group had experienced the gender equality of their country's wife, the hunt was opened to Sabrina."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"because of fear for their life, they drew the last analysis to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working as a volunteer in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"one day I told me, that anyone needed my help."</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend of Dagestan, a transwoman who stuck in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread her everywhere in the Internet, with my phone number and a picture of mine. he sent her back to his Chechnya friends, with the following message:" then there is no more men in Chechnya who can eliminate these shame? "</seg>
<seg id="2260">Then the photos of my documents were made by the whole of WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was just there, I heard a few shopping pieces from the back of my car, I heard a man's voice:" "here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned, I felt something in my body, but I did nothing hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time on Chechnya:" how long do you want to honor the family, you sweat? "</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I only know that there was a young man, no 30 years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up in the final analysis in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had got everything and started to cry.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was flown.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two pples in my right lung wings.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in what sickwings were you put in - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time in his office, I got it to do with the fear; it was a Muslim, a caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he is respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">In the last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote to me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"sending me back to Chechnya, to prove that it was all a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they presented absurd claims: some said to me, I must prove it by walking up without the streets; others wanted me to say in the official television in Grosny and say that I had not changed my sex, that everything was only bad, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have body-size C - what would I have to say in television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once spoke my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," "You have brought a monster to the world that not only has your family, but the whole republic."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she put a stick around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbors came and delivered them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later in the window stood a car with darkened windows and a numeric plate with a 95 on it.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"once it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that something was lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human right-justifiable friends checked the numerical signs - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flown?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for safety reasons, I do not want to offer their names, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help I left the country, but then something happened unbelief."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought them, without recording me, without any credit card, without any anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came in and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother per Whatsapp, I got a message:" "you don't believe in security, just because you have left the country?"</seg>
<seg id="2309">"our people already know, in which hotel you steckel. you even know your room number."</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still contact your family in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we do not talk about the gender equality but that is a tabular theme."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some of the traditional Caucasian elements do I still wear in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"so much as I wish, this soul barrier can not be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I actually give me effort to look like the person she reminds of her past - so on my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed there?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the needed I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">"I spoke to someone, who had saved the one and a half months in Argun."</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan, he was not arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could not wait to wait, and he did not lock a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"I mean, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end require a proof that the so-called" "honour" "has been experienced by blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are now even gay men recorded in this secrecy?</seg>
<seg id="2330">"Sabrina: a acquaintance of me says, there were just not many."</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then above all those who have no rich relatives or were dropped by their relatives, to face Kadyrows."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are held there so that they can present them later than terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: should they be perished, you will show off their bodies on TV and claim that they would have attacked any village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not just gone but targeted to radiating themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is it just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I have just been one of the one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown up beard.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There have been nothing new of them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They have just taken them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was even though these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"however, until now they were not presented as a bandits, there have been no reports so far. we would guess that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would you not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know whether this persecution and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called" non-traditional "orientation, have already taken place in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair for long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think that before 2003 I was already known in Grosny than I still lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999 when the sharia was considered, I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, then it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to approach the" "civil isation", "but ultimately has thrown us back to the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were added; I had colored lashes, carried the tube and short Tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Security Council of Sharia has never pushed me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in Grosny Theater in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches stood, and the whole city knew; they knew why men, young people met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"in the Chechen language there is a Redemption: Kharda, Kharda. that means" Spotte, not on the misfortune of another. ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">"it is often said to children, when they are making fun over sick."</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just have their eyes closed in front of you, because they believed that you are sick? "</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never lost me never hunts and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this treasure time hold on?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrow came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister, he began to talk on morality concerning morality."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not speak about us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, you could feel how the people in the city started to change."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"he who blew up before and borrowed, and looked at one time with Argwohn."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the Republic is constantly worse."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what kind of activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teacup, assembling, I transfer them to the hospital and help them to get Essenes."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I do not have a penny for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I found this man even when I flake refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you carry a Hidalgo?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is Albanians.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so is nature, that has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to prophesy with foam in front of the mouth, that there is no homosexuals with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have which, the cabaret have which, the Russians also have which, all over the planet, there are they - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, therefore it is unpleasant for me to hear something."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during the Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think of Transidentity in men who love men, and they believe that you can move his generation to make more intimate experiences. but this is a loss."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different types of sensation, in order to be exact, different habitats."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and do not harm me for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Don't know if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry, I will be my personal intimate relationship here now, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not very sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian ancestral region is suffering from an unusually high degree of unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>

<seg id="2400">"the self-burning of a man called Jassim Moramazi on 27 August was the distressing situation of the Arab Spring-Nazi community in Iran, which is dominated by poverty and unemployment."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he dwelt in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered under anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">"a video held on YouTube has held the moments, after he had lit itself, firm."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"some people managed to delete the flames, and Moramazi was brought into the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahvz."</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the incinerations were so strong that doctors could do nothing more."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activist on site warn that even more men could take life."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights released that this month is a few others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have one thing in common: it was all family Fathers, who felt helpless and impotent due to the persecution by the Iranian government, helpless and unable to feed their families and to ensure a safe work."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab" "Arab-Nazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which a large part of the Arab ancestors living in the Arab Republic of Iran was shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to strive for their livelihoods.</seg>
<seg id="2412">"in front of a century, the Arabic pediwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi Monarchy took over power and undertook great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the genealogz region, there are some of the largest in Iran in the coming oil and gas fields, as well as some of the busiest and most valuable agricultural areas for the Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy is still developing slowly, and the native population only gets little from that wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime denied the Ahwazi Arabs, systematically jobs in local oil, gas and petrochemical industry."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government has also built a variety of demon, the waters of the Arab areas into the Persian areas, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are lying."</seg>
<seg id="2418">These combs have only led to destroy the devastation caused in the region by drought and the local agriculture as well as to destroy the local agriculture and palms industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi-youth now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director for cooperatives, work and social welfare, that 5% of the Ahwazis, who are looking for a job, completed 55% a further school, and 45% have a university degree."</seg>

<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohimi, an Iranian ancestor human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mix of poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination, leads to a" high rise "in the number of self-morals among the young Ahwazi-men."</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that particularly unemployment has recently become worse. reason for this is a combination of a high number of in Ahwaz new ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the setting process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">"since the functionaries and institutions do not prefer to set the Arab labour force, the local Arab ancestors will be deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance, young Arabs and to force them to earn their livelihoods outside their homeland."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their pros and surnames to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi, and to be questioned as the Arabic names are not tolerated in the workplace, because the speaking of Arabic language or the carrying Arabic language."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the given circumstances, who have to endure the Arab ancestors, human rights activists alert, before the situation is explosive."</seg>

<seg id="2435">"the following article is a revised version of opinion which was written by Ayomide, and originally published on the website Afroféminas. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions have been expressed."</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can be read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"if I say that I am not a feminist, many women react - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">You wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">"they even set up well-thought scientific and social arguments in front of me, why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all feminists."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women are still less money despite same education than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under stringent observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women live sooner or later in various fields of life, and that discrimination based on the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware of and well-known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I am double and triple underneath.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"nevertheless: when I come to speak on skin colour, on racism, on black CIS women, on black transient women, on black women in the LGBTIQ congregation, or on black women from the Diaspora, when I have chosen, both in and outside the feminist movement, decide to mention many white feminists and white intersectional feminists."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"but nevertheless, all agree that women - all women - should come together to" "lift their voices and 'Kumbaya, my Lord' to sing equality (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they do not want to talk about it, that in addition to sexual violence there is an institutionalized form of racial motivates, which we are exposed to black women."</seg>
<seg id="2450">"or that, black women and women of other ethnicities and provenance will make less than white men and women."</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with migration background are often referred to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"" "or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all the women, all the men and all men of any skin colour; on the other hand, I cannot connect as a black woman in whose center the white woman stands to consider the injustices contained in their mind, which refers to the gender as well as to the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and won't fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere called me and countless other black women over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"Sojourner complained 1851 in their speech:" "am I not a woman?" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in historical respect, a dehumanly and marginalised being."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join me groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs, in order to advance their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to give white women the importance of overlapping skin colour and gender, because some of them continue to keep the meaning of black women for feminist movement not to be dead, no matter how many black women try to instruct them for the better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional feminism was established to give women different herds a home and bordering themselves from white feminism, is still the word" feminism "in his name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to get rid of myself fully and completely of feminism, which was called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it is more important than ever, that we define black women with us according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Wealth (about: Africa-Womanism: as we can defend ourselves), that we can defend ourselves in this way, in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, mental, physical and even the spiritual elements can be revered that the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists are immediately calling for separatism and exclusion, I ask you to inform yourself about hypocrisy and contradictions of feminist movement by which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am acknowledged as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as part of this paradigm.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and edited version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay." the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# christmas bow) that reported on the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to protect the persons concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police officer said Ada Báez, that she had nothing against Luis Balbuena, her partner who had been active against violent."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of its relationship a little time has passed and the police said, their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"as another woman Balbuena, because of distracts, also showed the acute display of Ada Báez nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second woman later drew her ad."</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women run at all once, they generally do not receive support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, the women also depend financially by the men that they mistruined. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to the victims of violence occur in case of law enforcement authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"content 1 Temples and Statistical 2 Unseen blows and a legal system which is not underestimated 3 Paraguays laws: good approach, lack of implementation and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender questions at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social research institute in Paraguay." there are various information and reports that do not even approach the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2491">The figures available are however alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015 at the District Council, 9600 ads went on account of domestic violence. at 70% of it, it was about violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads when police came to women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the peace generals. also here 86% of the ads come from women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads, 40% of women said that they were physically suspicious, 55% of women spoke of psychotic mistreacts."</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics show however not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the paraguayischen female Minister of Ana Baiardi, only few of these offenders will actually be shown." on every woman who will not be refunded in Paraguay due to mental failure, 9 females who do not do so. "</seg>
<seg id="2498">"for every woman who will be refunded on every woman because of physical abuse, two women who do not do this, stated in the end of 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's genocide in Paraguay is not a proprietary crime, law enforcement agencies cannot be adequately documented, how many women were murdered by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">Only until August 2016 journalists were elected at least 12 cases of genocide in the country alone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates in Paraguay every ten days a woman because of violence caused by men.</seg>

<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez was the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called him the name of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning she didn't want to do this, but after all. this was to always repent."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today, Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but two years she carried the psychic power in turn - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognizable by the most severe:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I would never have thought that I would become a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read earlier about it, I always thought that only women are going to be underestimated, because they are deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana social media to report on the assault by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"called by name, she wrote posts on Facebook where she described its insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship and told them how he had isolated them."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically, whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of failure."</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked why they had fallen so long from Carlos and did not leave it earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">"it seemed almost as though they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had a certain compassion."</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, which is not from Paraguay, fought nearly eight years with authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner they mistreated it."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo te CREO ("I believe you") which consists of women all in any way victims of failure.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychic mistreacts.</seg>
<seg id="2521">"their wealthy partner, it finally managed to convince them to convince them that they were worthless."</seg>

<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need on site-run medical research there are two reasons: there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in the poorest countries have far considerable effects than elsewhere, and lack of investment in research on these diseases are a big problem."</seg>

<seg id="2627">"from the USA to India: how" open source "seed producers can change global food production"</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this post by Rachel Cernansky originally appeared on the site Ensia.com, a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been active in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"his company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredgeous, the first plant that is grown by NASA astronauts in outer space and consumed."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"nearly 20 years of work, Morton's work was made only by his own resourcefulness and the question of how many Salatars it can get borders."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but in the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salaries were patented and that he could not continue to use them."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"patents have not only used for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resilience against diseases, a special red or green leaflets."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more and more such patents have been registered on more and more plants such as cereals or cardboard boxes. due to these trends, plant breeding, environmentalists and experts have become food security around the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia of ancient tradition, Morton continues to be salad, but it is now longer needed, as its work is still further aggravated by ever more restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it's like being in a river a boulder, in order to paddle me."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we need to do that now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," says he. "I think these patents go far too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and when they stand in court, no one can breed more of a new species of salads, because all the features are already patented. so it is as good as possible and tries to breed those features that he wants."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and striving to use no material which is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He is also connected to a movement that is getting bigger in the US and throughout the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source").</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Center ISS have cultivated red Römersalat of the sort of Outredgeous in the "greenhouse." there is tested if plants are grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">"it is not a coincidence that this name sounds rather like this, as if the movement comes from the IT area and not out of the field of plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2644">The open source Seed Initiative (initiative for "open source" seeds) can be inspired by the motion for free "open source" software to provide alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was called into life, in order to ensure that some plant species and gens are not protected as intellectual property and can be used for plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"in the context of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit to that others can use the seeds free of them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and buy it." open source "breeder only allow others to breed their seeds, to breed so their own varieties, and it does not immediately agree - two aspects that may be prohibited or prescribed by many plants."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy views</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emeried professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg are control over the seed, and the ability to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to it, seed plays an important role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by using seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open-source" movement is not busy with genetically modified crops.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not, from ecological agriculture or not."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the open source Seed Initiative are committed to providing other to their seeds on the other, so that its way in contrast to patent seeds and plant features."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi-supporters argue that the future of food supplies is endangered, since the available genpool due to the ever more numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus always more restricted, incessantly shrink."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, Executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her doctorate with genetically variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all card features as intellectual property is protected as intellectual property either not or can be aggravated either."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"there are such estimates still not, but experts like Luby suspect that mass-grown plants like wheat are patented in still larger style than salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are so bred as they have targeted features - of those, by which their taste or colour improves up to those, due to which they prosper in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties show that the available plant material for breeder is decreasing through more and more patents. genetic diversity is more than ever before, since the changed conditions are much worse by climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto-Spreein Carly Scaduto to that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial to Monsanto's activities. with a total of four central banks and cooperation with institutions such as the State Department of United States, the company will set itself the company for the preservation of genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it believes that intellectual property is other breeders." "a patent is basically taken a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent is expired."</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come along with another method of the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"thus, such protection inhibits innovations not, but also encourages them to be made available to the public more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton looks at the other: 20 years to wait until a patent expire, but certainly not innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait so long for it to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have already lost the battle."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"but the main one for Morton is, however, that genetic resources have always been a general good and to continue to stay:" independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives for us are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">That is what drives us and it is impossible to us if we do not continue to use the best and newest genetic resources.</seg>
<seg id="2672">"altogether, Morton is interferes with the concept of itself, plant features:" we do not create the characteristics really. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants do they form themselves, and as a breeder, we finally have no idea how the plants do that."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the U.S. state of Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" who is a sort of art, and its own values in it. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for their cultivation, herbicides are needed to grow into his varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly matured. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some moderate-sized companies (such, who are moving on international markets, but smaller than e.g. Monsanto are) patents, create it the most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant engineer Frank Morton is looking for in his breeding garden salad.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"in addition, Morton is also the view that breeder by the prevention of plants of innovative would be:" it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new, stronger than firms that patrons. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need constantly new material to my catalogue, since I know my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years," "says he." "with a patent it is 20 years ahead of competition, which makes it quite simple for my opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"in fact, the US seem to be a leader in the" open source "breeding, but the concept is spreading rapidly around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India the Centre is leading for sustainable agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, a" open source "seed program. to obtain the seeds of traditional farm plants, the centre with farmers work together and helps to breed new varieties which meet certain requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "open source" seeds and to sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organisation Agrecol works on an open source license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi commitment to breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeding differ from country to country who cannot simply be transferred to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, explains that conventional plants should not be patented, and thus it speaks itself against the current practice of the European Patent, which is allowed patents on conventionally bred plants."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not a law; it is now the governments of the Member States to bring this new line to the governments of the Member States."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference to" open source "seed systems in Ethiopia, to the farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organisations and seed companies from all East Africa to find something about the" open source "seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patenting seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for" open source "seed systems, that the organisation currently uses a global alliance for" open source "seed systems, which should be scheduled next year of the official start."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a merger of environmental and development groups (including Hivos, the international nonprofit development aid organisation USC Canada and the Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database on a seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of the food - a network of aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - to make a report on seeds, to exchange and improve the seed policy, so that a stable supply can be ensured by food."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also emphasises the importance of a varied, local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection, by the Luby of Ossi to see him more people soon."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has especially respected where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role, so Luby." we are now trying to make the people clear that even more behind their foods lies. "</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organization and blog are the latest aims of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Still unlock the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"on the weekend of the 05.August, the Egyptian government passed the website of the German Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights abuses in Egypt and the Arab world and reports about it."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"on August, the network published an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities criticized on this step sharply and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region."</seg>
<seg id="2725">"the German Network for Human Rights Information will lead, despite this attack and the mocking of the Egyptian right and the constitution by the authorities, to defend the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it has never been so important to overcome these goals, so it was never so important as it is now. ANHRI has never been so important to overcome the blocking or not. we insist on doing our task further."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities have blocked more than two months 21 websites, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arab-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Qatar-based network of Al Jazeera due to alleged" "support of terrorism".

<seg id="2728">"in addition to ANHRI, there is no access to the blog of columnist and human rights research scientist Ahmed Gamal Ziada."</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the spread of columnists and articles that he does not write on-day websites and media for in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">"now the blog, which he was established to bypass the censored apparatus of the Egyptian government, even the goal of an attack."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"bloggers, the provider of which is native to the capital blog, is on the other hand."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested in December 2013 by Egyptian security guards, while he reported on the Studentenprotests and a video, how the police force physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article deals primarily about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment Ziada spoke to the blocking through the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">"the blogs to lock blogs is very old, but has given priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It has succeeded to convey to me the feeling of a siege, a arrest, a trying murder, unloading of the national Security Council, the blocking blogs as well as any other web site for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) You have proven that I wrote not in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only on a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"first, I used to get it to the post of articles in order to handle the censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"however, after having locked it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mute go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06. August 133 websites. this provided technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"AFTE documented also the blocking of vendors, through the evasion of internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, 12 June 1992 we noticed how the blocking of web pages, the VPNs offer."</seg>
<seg id="2746">"such practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block content, and filter to access the Egyptian users."</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation in addition is thereby exacerbated that the decisions will be made behind closed doors, thus the Egyptian population has no legal basis, using the court against these actions."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"now, the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack them next?"</seg>

<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>

<seg id="2764">"in a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, that this decision is not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure."</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war of war in a country that does not recognise the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 areas that are controlled by criminal organizations."</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the Editorial writes the newspaper further:</seg>

<seg id="2769">"but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and their partners."</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the name "war" more than it defends?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil argued the journalist of Cecília Oliveira, against the violence as a" war. "this was their opinion a justification of failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to account of the police to account."</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - such as an extra during the analysis of military deployment in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and self-bogganing neglect of public service. "</seg>

<seg id="2888">He worked for a few years in a coal pit. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">"then he took what was left of his low wages, and went to Iran. once again, he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and towed sacks with mortar, which were more difficult than he himself to make his livelihoods."</seg>

<seg id="2892">There was no services there and no heating. we hung Nylon in front of the open windows so that we do not spend at night.</seg>

<seg id="2894">"at the dangerous crossing in the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island."</seg>
