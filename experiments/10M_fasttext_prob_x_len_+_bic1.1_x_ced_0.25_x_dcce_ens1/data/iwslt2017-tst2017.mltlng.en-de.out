this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
&quot; before any one heard of Edward Snowden , R@@ isen wrote a book in which it is spectacular , that the NSA is illegal teleph@@ ones of Americans . &quot;
&quot; however , it is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression . &quot;
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA was literally dra@@ ined for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an unbelievable story .
but do you know whom the chapter did not fall ?
the US government .
&quot; for nearly 10 years , the government fought against the signs and asked him to name his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this train , he became a symbol for the pattern of government , whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to condemn and journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to First A@@ mend@@ ment , the media have the right to publish information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to use this right , if the media does not get this information and if they are not able to protect the identity of the mu@@ le they give . &quot;
&quot; so when the government broke out at R@@ isen , he did something which many courageous re@@ porters said before him : he refused , and said he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; so from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go into prison . &quot;
&quot; however , just days before the trial , something else happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they were written for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government have been abandoned . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the re@@ porters can and sources can always hide away .
&quot; rather than fail to fail , rather than to fail , this could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ator , without his consent , his call , secre@@ tive , &quot;
&quot; just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and ban@@ ker information , its l@@ ending , and even travel @-@ wise with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and ris@@ ens allegedly . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect his steps , whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers . but instead , the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government has too much of its work as a secret . &quot;
since September 11 almost every article about national security has been the result of that a whist@@ le @-@ blo@@ wers went to a journalist .
&quot; so we set up the press work on the game , which should be protected by the first constitutional complaints , because the government has more and more possibilities to send all of them . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology allowed the government to handle the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; while they can get in touch with it from the moment in which they contact , instead of the night , in witness . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software that has not yet been written as a ro@@ isen book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source @-@ source system for whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , which was originally developed by the internet @-@ famous , which was developed by us , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I work . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , just like any ordinary contact form . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server which only has access to the respective News Agency .
&quot; so the government cannot secre@@ tly er@@ ased a lot of information , and many of the information they would call it would not be available . &quot;
&quot; but , Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole , to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments all over the world develop new es@@ pi@@ on technologies that end@@ anger us . &quot;
&quot; it is to make sure that not only technology @-@ denom@@ in@@ ator like Edward Snowden have a way to put ini@@ qui@@ ties . it is just as important that we protect the next whist@@ le @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot;
&quot; he wants to tell about the gri@@ ev@@ ances in the care of soldiers and wants to report about over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental worker , the alarm goes for polluted water from F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street in@@ sider that war@@ ns us in front of the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to un@@ cover the crime , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the largest data le@@ ck of the story was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that kingdoms and powerful &#93; &#91; we b@@ ade Robert Pal@@ mer from Global Wit@@ ness hidden by Global Wit@@ ness . &#93; This week we were resident of messages over a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ se@@ ca
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sy Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works , as it works . &quot;
this has already led to a very direct consequences .
islands prime minister is rec@@ eded .
there are also reports that a allies of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bashar al @-@ Assad has let@@ ops in tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; it is said that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin is conducting a tight friend from children &apos;s days , a famous Cell@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous to wait for the next release , and the next revealed documents . &quot;
now this sounds like the plot of a studio @-@ ri@@ llers or John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham &apos;s novel .
&quot; it seems cri@@ es away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we address this ?
&quot; but the truth is , if the rich and mighty are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not to pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , streets . &quot;
and this affects us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenomenal . &quot;
&quot; in all over the world media and leading politicians , such as secret tax hav@@ ens are used by some few to hide , their assets hide and disgu@@ ise -- something that we have been discussing for ten years and reveal . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem very confusing this whole world , and it is difficult to understand how this tax hav@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine it as a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so , one has a company in a different company , in another company , in a further firm , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these commandments . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for pro@@ secu@@ tions and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really understand what thing is . &quot;
I find it interesting too that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US .
&quot; presumably , because there had been no more prominent Americans who had passed this sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the principle according to which this tax hav@@ ens work , Mos@@ se Fon@@ se@@ ca has fewer American customers . &quot;
&quot; could we have a data le@@ ck of the Cayman Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that you need less information in some US states to specify less information to create a company than a libr@@ arian . &quot;
this kind of in@@ fusion in the US has allowed employees to release school@@ children to release school@@ children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it does not allow frau@@ ds to extract especially vulnerable investors . &quot;
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does that work ?
so we sent a tw@@ isted investig@@ ator in the offices of 13 An@@ w@@ alts@@ firms in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator gave herself as an African minister , who wanted to bring double money to the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; we really shocked , it really shocked that all the up to a lawyer of our investig@@ ators make suggestions as he could transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; these were all pre@@ meetings . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course anybody was handed over to the money . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as individuals .
&quot; it is not about a single attor@@ ney , who has been instruc@@ ted by our covered investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; it is not about a single leaders , ent@@ an@@ gled into a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , through the corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we must change the rules of rules . &quot;
we must change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult .
&quot; this may sound everything very dull as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing had ever changed , as if it is always the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a born optim@@ ist , I see that a lot has begun to change . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen violations of greater transparency in the past few years , as far as the owners of companies are concerned . &quot;
the issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU has captured in central reg@@ isters at the national level , who really lies behind companies in Europe , and who has controlled them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the USA is lag@@ ging behind here .
&quot; representatives of both parties have earned a draft law in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
&quot; we need ordinary people who become angry , when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind hypo@@ crisy . &quot;
we need executives in the economy to get up and say : &quot; In@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and stand up for it , by laws this kind of in@@ transparent . &quot;
&quot; together we can finally end the in@@ fusion , which now allows this kind of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I was almost kidn@@ apped and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das . &quot;
&quot; one day after I completed my design study , I made a back@@ yard selling . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da remained and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . afterwards he would go to the peace of peace .
I invited him to a beer . he told me excited about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I became tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him , &quot; &quot; Where are you looking for this day ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know whether he really is planning . I don &apos;t want to go up in the trunk of a Maz@@ et ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
&quot; then I heard myself : &quot; &quot; I have a li@@ lo . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; h , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I get there ? &quot;
a game @-@ strange is sleeping in my living room .
what if he is mad ?
&quot; I was given such a fear that I went out of bed , on top @-@ pointed tips to the door , and my sleeping room closed . &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
&quot; the work of art , which he bought from me , is today in his classroom . he is now a teacher . &quot;
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my view .
&quot; maybe the people who were sold to me in childhood as strangers were really friends , who just waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; to accommodate people on my air@@ mat was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air barrier . &quot;
&quot; we make a time , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my roomm@@ ate draws and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I think creativity can create it , anxiety in fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new roomm@@ ate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; &quot; Brian , I over@@ lays out how we could make something like this . our apartment is equipped with a designer bed @-@ and @-@ breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including breakfast , a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
&quot; we created a website and founded so &quot; &quot; Air@@ mat and Breakfast &quot; &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; . &quot;
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air@@ mat on wood@@ flooring .
&quot; they found it great , and we too . &quot;
&quot; I am sure to decorate our cheese @-@ ham @-@ o@@ mel@@ et completely different , because we made them for our guests . &quot;
we tou@@ red with them all over the city . when we passed our last guest and fell into the castle the door closed down to the castle .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay for our rent ?
the things arrived in the re@@ els .
&quot; my former roomm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept .
&quot; we presented ourselves to investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people are public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room , whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot;
&quot; via the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them at night . &quot;
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le would be .
&quot; in fact , it is not . &quot;
&quot; no one who is still with consol@@ ation would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we as children have all learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you agree on the things you can well . we could design@@ ate . &quot;
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and t@@ acti@@ le -- it is the overall experience .
&quot; we learned how to construct objects , but now we wanted to create an immense trust between people who have never met before . &quot;
can design do such a thing ?
is it possible to create with design confidence ?
&quot; I would like to give you a sample , which degree you trust us . &quot;
it is a 30 @-@ seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comfort .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone in your hand .
&quot; now , I would like to block that you un@@ lock your mobile phone . &quot;
enter your un@@ lock mobile phone to your left seat .
&quot; this quiet approach to panic , which you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door the first time . &quot;
&quot; for the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone , is your home . &quot;
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ lock sound of a stranger in your hands ?
most are the responsibility of the responsibility .
&quot; so , most guests feel when they stay elsewhere . &quot;
only because of this reason our company can exist .
&quot; only then , who now has Al Gor@@ es cell phone ? &quot;
could you please tell us on Twitter that he was can@@ cel@@ ed for the Office of the President ?
you can return the mobile phones now .
you have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build up . I would like to share with you some discoveries .
what if we had changed a small detail on this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbour would have presented only once with his name , when he told , Wh@@ ence he comes , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
&quot; imagine you would have 150 ass@@ ess@@ ments , which all say : &quot; &quot; he can really hold very well un@@ ned mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strength@@ ens confidence .
in the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to leave negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and visiting their jud@@ gements , before we set them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we carried out a study with Stan@@ ford a study . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are at age and residence . &quot;
little surprising we trust the people most who are similar to us .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bi@@ ases .
&quot; it is exciting when you add the call to a person -- in our case by ass@@ ess@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; if one has less than three jud@@ g@@ ments , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but one has more than ten , it changes everything . &quot;
a good reputation among similarities .
so the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preference .
&quot; furthermore , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get out of it . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; Hi ! &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; one tells a lot , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request will also be rather not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; Tol@@ le art@@ works in your apartment ! I do this with my family holiday . &quot;
how can we create it with design to produce this degree of openness ?
&quot; we use the size of the text field , to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something . &quot;
&quot; our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help , overcome our prejudices against strangers . &quot;
&quot; what we did not expect , the large amount of people who were more than prepared to dis@@ solve these prejudices . &quot;
here you can see how many people take our offer .
one can recognize three things .
&quot; first , incredibly much luck . &quot;
&quot; second , the tirel@@ ess work of our team . &quot;
&quot; third , a demand that had not been covered previously . &quot;
for us the business runs very well .
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who have been un@@ authorised parties and have devast@@ ated homes .
hosts will leave guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with the customer service . all calls came directly on my mobile phone .
&quot; I stood at the foref@@ ront , when trust has been broken . &quot;
there is nothing worse than these calls . it already hur@@ ts when I only think of it .
the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve .
&quot; fortunately , there had only a fraction of the 123 million remaining nights only a fraction ever . &quot;
for people trust each other right .
&quot; when confidence works , there can be mir@@ ac@@ ulous . &quot;
one of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host went him to the hospital .
he even don@@ ated blood for the necessary operation !
here is its assessment :
perfect house for travellers who tend to have a heart attack due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals .
Javier and Alej@@ andra be true gu@@ ardian angels who save one life even though they do not know one thing .
&quot; you drive a car into the hospital , when you die , and wait , while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they do not want you to feel lonely , they bring books over . &quot;
let you stay one even longer without charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
this is of course not all your stay .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to reach with the Share economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled upon this concept for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is an economic trade .
&quot; but it is now simply called &quot; &quot; flat industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot;
&quot; Share Economy describes a trade , human relationships promises . &quot;
people lay a part of itself open and that changes everything .
&quot; traveling nowadays , it is possible to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
what if traveling were a rich buffet of local impressions ?
&quot; what if in every place you visited , a group there would wait to wait a group there and to show a thoroughly pent@@ agr@@ arian neighborhood of which one has never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to privacy .
what if we would like to share apartments from the ground up to the inter@@ sequence ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities were to accept the thoughts of the common part ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships , instead of lon@@ eliness and shut@@ downs . &quot;
&quot; in South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking places included in the government , &quot;
&quot; were now offered to the inhabitants . students , who were looking for a place , &quot;
were given to people whose children were lab@@ elled .
&quot; in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people will be host in 191 countries as a guest at a foreign or even host . &quot;
the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was brought to us .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality were also before .
there have been similar websites before us .
so why did our work just work ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we realize that you can find the right design with the components of the trust . &quot;
design can help us to overcome profound prejudi@@ ce .
&quot; I find that amaz@@ ingly , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
&quot; I have to think about this , when a red Maz@@ da is passing by me . &quot;
we know of course that design cannot solve any problem .
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we are able to use it for . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think when you see me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , a bra@@ in@@ washing , a terrorist group ? &quot;
or just delay a delay at the airport at the airport .
this is actually true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
thus the media people represent what look like me .
one study revealed that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans mean , most would not know Muslims . &quot;
probably people do not speak with their U@@ ber riders .
for those who have never met some Muslims : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; a se@@ ag@@ ulls , fitness @-@ fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Mus@@ lim@@ in . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so . &quot;
I decided to do so .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a homo@@ sexual man , as some of my friends , but as Mus@@ cat . I chose to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head@@ gear . &quot;
&quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied , &quot; &quot; Why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : back then it was a feminist declaration of independence , and to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt me to a perfect and un@@ reachable beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Koran .
&quot; I read him , thought to question , posed in question , dou@@ bt@@ ful and believed ultimately . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow dedication that deep@@ ened with every reading of the object .
the beauty of rhythm brings me sometimes to tears .
I know myself about it . I feel God knows me .
&quot; ever had you ever feel that somebody perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
this is how it feels like that .
&quot; later I married and began as all the good Egyptians , my career as engineers . &quot;
&quot; I had later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream &quot; . &quot; &quot;
then that dre@@ ad@@ ful morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had dinner at the end , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; E@@ il@@ log@@ on . &quot; &quot;
&quot; smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people spi@@ kes out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock turned quickly into rebellion .
why should you do something like this ?
&quot; I changed the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists , ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ b@@ ted Mecca ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not only my country to attack , but in the N@@ u the acts of others turned into a susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle West of the United States to move into a new city and start studying the building . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I was silent -- when we were silent -- so deep it went in my seat , and I feared the first time to be recognized as Mus@@ lim@@ in . &quot;
&quot; we went to our apartment in this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then heard , I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said , &quot; &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; so@@ oth@@ ed in good illuminated areas , &quot; &quot; sam@@ pl@@ ush you not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week indo@@ ors .
then it was Friday that week -- the day in which Muslims gathered for prayer .
&quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; not on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage of the media .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered , and I also heard of attacks to Muslims or from people who held for Muslims to fre@@ eze . &quot;
there were really brands on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay home .
&quot; however , something did not feel right . &quot;
because the people who had attacked this country have attacked our land .
I got the anger of the people away on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain itself constantly .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
these are the alleg@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; nowadays , we can actually say people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot;
when will we go on ? &quot;
some people want to join Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
it only raises the question : are we malicious or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ignant tum@@ ours as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only under observation .
the alternatives are po@@ int@@ less because the question is false .
&quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but a vital organ . &quot;
thanks !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , agents and Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques America be more secure ?
&quot; there will be some parking free , but not stop terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit to a mosque leads to the people of other faith , and to show greater citizenship . &quot;
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington , DC was recently reported : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed before a computer .
&quot; the radic@@ alisation process has found that it will start online . as a first , the person can cut off their church , even by their family , so that the person who believes the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor , or their ideology . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop the people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS substanti@@ ated its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as mus@@ li@@ in , as a mother , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
yet we would like to add to their imagination when you acknowledge them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology in their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but when one casts a look at it , she does not pass on what they spoke in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot;
it is its brut@@ ality that they can read these things into the scriptures .
an exceptionally Ima@@ m told me recently an amazing story :
&quot; a girl came to him , because she would have imagined the IS . &quot;
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every spiritual one had spoken to her , she brought her to silence and told her that her wrath would bring her mind to the injustice in the world , she would only bring her mind into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that had given sense to their anger , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization by extremis@@ ts that promised you a solution . &quot;
this ima@@ m put the connection to God and her church again .
&quot; instead of acc@@ use them for their fur@@ y , he showed her constructive ways for real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mosque , she kept her to join the IS . &quot;
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ ophobia me and my family concerns .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect every other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear each day affect our democracy on our minds ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies - show : when we fear that at least three things happen .
&quot; we accept more an authorized government system , con@@ formity and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; a study reveals that if you have Test@@ ed messages in which negative about Muslims was reported , they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; when you look when the mood against Muslims ended up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in advance of the Iraq war and two electoral periods .
&quot; thus , Islam@@ ophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected it . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool for manipulation of public to be the foundation of a free society , which has sensible and well informed citizens . &quot;
the handling of Moslems is an early warning mark .
&quot; we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear gives us all of us . &quot;
&quot; at the assignment of collec@@ tiv@@ ation , it is not just about to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both of them went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a athlete .
&quot; he was at the dental Fac@@ ulty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , the most generous man , whom she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was fl@@ ab@@ ber@@ gast@@ ed and she said :
&quot; when is of my flock , such a sealed young man has become ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ zanne &apos;s visit to her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she assass@@ inated , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was in the afternoon , as with a execution , having posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he was eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque or stayed there safe at home ?
&quot; we pra@@ ys it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about that America we want to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely . &quot;
we chose the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , took my shoes off , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw , left me . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , than@@ ked and called our guests , for half of the assembled were Christians , Jews , Buddh@@ ists , ath@@ e@@ ists , believers and non @-@ believers who came to join us , but to assist us . &quot;
at this moment I am collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion and prejudices .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you go to number sure ?
or will you connect to those who mean : we are better than that .
many thanks .
thanks beautiful !
&quot; Helen Wal@@ ters : well D@@ alia , you seem to have met a Ner@@ v . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what do you say to those who might claim that you hold a TE@@ D@@ talk , a thought @-@ in with deep breath , thus an exception rather than the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say no dec@@ ei@@ ving . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; when you look around Muslims around the world , and I did that with the biggest ever carried out study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
&quot; so , I am in no way an exception . &quot;
&quot; if people seem like an exception to the rule , then often the rule is broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what began as a platform for Bast@@ ers , is about to become a milli@@ ar@@ den@@ business . &quot;
&quot; monitoring , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journalism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial threats . &quot;
&quot; before air condition@@ er in our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six meter high tower of 1 500 bricks . a few years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es . &quot;
inter@@ connecting cables reach high speed and acceler@@ ation on the nar@@ ro@@ west space .
you can also build self @-@ saving structures .
they have learned to carry loads with turmo@@ il and in general respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to cross the borders of the possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; so that a system works autonom@@ ously , it must know collectively , where in the space the mobile objects are located . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects , which allows us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic Tas@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , an off@@ shoot of our laboratories . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; every air@@ machine has internal sensors , to determine the position in the room , which should determine what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external orders are available at the highest level . for example , &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; landing &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called h@@ ap@@ starter , &quot;
a flight device that tries to beat two flies with a fla@@ p .
&quot; like other Star@@ r@@ wings , it is efficient in the ahead flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most of the starters , it can so@@ ars , and thus has great benefits at startup and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
however there is always a down@@ side .
a restriction of h@@ ap@@ points is that they respond sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as wind @-@ bows .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight device doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimal position has at@@ tained and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often face basic abstract questions related to the core of the matter . &quot;
such a question would be for example : what is the smaller number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
&quot; helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand mo@@ vable parts , which work together to hurt you . &quot;
&quot; decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly away @-@ controlled air equipment , which only had two mobile parts : a prop@@ eller and a tail@@ gate . &quot;
&quot; recently , we discovered that flying with only one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the mon@@ og@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simple remote @-@ served aircraft . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only a mo@@ vable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross @-@ herds , no further Stell@@ is@@ ances or controllers , just a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , happens in the interior a lot , so that it can fly stable and move in space . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the H@@ eck@@ y . to bring it to flying , I have to put it right correctly . &quot;
&quot; the lik@@ el@@ ihood of throwing it exactly right if all of them see is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ og@@ inner is an exercise in pleasure , this machine is here , the Omni@@ kop@@ ter with its eight Prop@@ eller , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is symm@@ etri@@ cally .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; thus , he receives the most beautiful ability , &quot;
&quot; move in space in all directions , no matter what direction he rot@@ ate or even like it rotating . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight Prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; some is present in models , the rest will be acquired directly at flying . &quot;
let &apos;s see that .
&quot; when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and secure . &quot;
this machine is made up of two separate twin @-@ prop@@ eller engines .
this turns on clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the others against clo@@ ck@@ wise .
&quot; if you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller goes out , electronics or battery - can continue to fly the machine if restricted . &quot;
&quot; we will now demonstrate , by doing a half plane . &quot;
the last demonstration examined synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took the sweet Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each individual weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no limit .
hopefully you will motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine is over @-@ over and wants to be a flu@@ ke lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to pre@@ dict the influence of this technology . &quot;
for guys like us there is wages in the development and the creation .
&quot; it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that there are creative , clever creatures allowed to form it in such a spectacular fashion . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive industrial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
&quot; before 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes revol@@ ves each other in a very far distant galaxy , the mass of three suns in a t@@ enth@@ s of t@@ art in pure energy . &quot;
this short moment they shining bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole of us @-@ known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but her energy does not set her in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into the space @-@ time structure and explo@@ ded the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us arrange the events at first time .
more than 1.3 billion years ago the life of the Earth had just emerged .
&quot; since then the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sau@@ rier , people and -- God stand by us -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group especially courageous -- R@@ ai Weiss was decided by MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech -- to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which are formed approximately by col@@ li@@ de black holes . &quot;
most they thought for crazy .
&quot; but enough people realized it as a crazy geni@@ uses , so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the det@@ ector L@@ IG@@ O : the Laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ om@@ ometer @-@ gra@@ vit@@ ational Ob@@ servatory . &quot;
&quot; in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of L@@ IG@@ O could greatly increase what the recognition @-@ performance was enormous . &quot;
therefore it is now called Advanced L@@ IG@@ O .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 L@@ IG@@ O was launched for a last test , to clarify some smaller , persistent problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ di@@ zing black holes is through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ arewell to my to@@ d@@ sick Father .
basically this were the fruits of my life .
&quot; all that which I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he studied for 23 years gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves out of black holes and their observ@@ atories such as L@@ IG@@ O measurable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a c@@ abling in the fabric of space and time .
&quot; when temporary the wave , the space and its entire content are covered in one direction and the other stretched out . &quot;
&quot; to illustrate , lectur@@ ers in courses of rel@@ ativity @-@ theory often leads to a properly al@@ ber@@ ing dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and storage , stretching and craw@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves extremely weak , even ridiculous . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September , for example , each of us was stretched on the sha@@ kes of the waves and st@@ acked the stretching of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that is , 20 N@@ ul@@ len after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1. the L@@ IG@@ O employees declared crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilometer long laser det@@ ector , and that is absurd , this length would have to be measured on less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucleus . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classical text about grav@@ itation
&quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties when building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; however , physi@@ c@@ ists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public will certainly overcome all obstacles . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne released this since 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to L@@ IG@@ O . Scott likes to say L@@ IG@@ O is more of an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phones . &quot;
that &apos;s quite convenient . because you can make a picture or a map of things by accepting that of several points coming around you .
in sounds that is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to manufacture a picture of things which mean you particularly much : &quot;
the face of your child about .
&quot; instead we listen to certain properties like tape and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind . &quot;
&quot; now , just Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob stops them . &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we can do not have simple pictures of objects in all of them .
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
&quot; at least , for L@@ IG@@ O are the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble range . &quot;
&quot; so if we can convert wave @-@ pattern into all , we can hear the All literally . &quot;
&quot; the grav@@ itation to listen , can tell us about a lot about the collision of two black holes , so my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time . &quot;
&quot; sh : two black , non rot@@ atable holes , cir@@ cl@@ amps simply : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; rot@@ ate the two bodies very quickly , you can hear the same circuit with an additional sound change . it sounds like that : Wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu ! &quot;
it is a kind of movement wor@@ sen@@ ing and shapes in the wav@@ e@@ form .
&quot; AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- I heard L@@ IG@@ O Fol@@ der : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ of the noise &#93; Jem@@ and , who knows what he must listen to , recogni@@ zes this as a sound of -- S@@ H : ... two black holes with the 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which can turn around as fast as the sticks of your mixture . &quot;
AA : let us think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the most dense body in the universe , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve each hundred times per second before it collap@@ ses . &quot;
imagine these forces in front of them .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we heard it .
therein lies the constant importance of L@@ IG@@ O .
L@@ IG@@ O paved a completely new way of exploring the universe as they never before was possible .
on this way we can listen to the All &apos;s and the unseen .
much in space we can -- practically or basically - not visible .
&quot; a super @-@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ts stars in super @-@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de . &quot;
they are very useful . we learned a lot about all of them .
&quot; the exciting physical processes happen however at the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never go through as this op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetr@@ ate iron , as if it were more transparent glass . the jungle is I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it as the jungle is covered by its own seed . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; most importantly , I am optim@@ istic that we have never seen all things that we have never seen before and of which we have no idea . things that we can only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; indeed , L@@ IG@@ O found the same in the first attempt that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the L@@ IG@@ O project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that have seen black holes as L@@ IG@@ O they ob@@ serves , are the dinosau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are called Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; L@@ IG@@ O makes us a completely different point of view of the events in all , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we went out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is to be as courageous as possible .
&quot; thanks to L@@ IG@@ O , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in all .
&quot; for what could be more beautiful than the pri@@ mor@@ gue , &quot;
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
some time ago I rehear@@ sed an experiment .
&quot; for a year I would say &quot; Yes , &quot; before whom I feared . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced me &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak in public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to live live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start playing with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : this is exactly what I feared , fri@@ ghtened my fear . &quot;
&quot; keep my fear , talk , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me . &quot;
&quot; but there was a certain Yes , that deeply changed my life , to an unexpected species . it started with a question of my youngest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for in@@ explic@@ able reasons all . &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the South .
&quot; estim@@ ation , I need milk for my beak @-@ up . &quot;
&quot; she asked me once I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; from then to swe@@ ar I swe@@ ar to me always to play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I just do , or where I go , I still tell Yes -- every single time . &quot;
almost . I am not perfect but I am trying much .
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , on my children , on our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has an ast@@ o@@ unding side effect : only recently , I actually understood that the &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; sa@@ ws for playing with my children my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am author . I think things , awaken you to life . &quot;
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I cre@@ ed television . I live TV .
I am doing TV in a great style .
in this TV season I am responsible to add 70 hours of program into the world .
&quot; four TV @-@ programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
&quot; each stream features hundreds of jobs , which will not exist before . &quot;
the budget for an episode of a tel@@ escope can be between three and six million dollars .
we say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days , four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars , television , four TV programs , four hours TV , three episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : show To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my television series are walking each other on Thursday night .
around the world my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators .
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself , and not only produced , so , it has to find time , really sti@@ cking , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories to tell . &quot;
&quot; four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire that burn around the world . &quot;
do you know who does that still do ?
&quot; nobody , this is why I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I would not like to impres@@ s you with it .
&quot; I say it because I know what you think , when the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I tell you so all of you who work so hard if you now speak a company , a country or a classroom , a business or budget , so you understand that I don &apos;t just talk on the computer and imagin@@ ative , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it is not about dreaming with a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , everything sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I went into work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a land out of nothing .
&quot; it &apos;s as if I put troops up , when I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; so , one can find a high tone , lying a mar@@ athon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechan@@ ically , stren@@ uous and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clinically and maternal , cruel and reasonable . and the best of it is the buzz . &quot;
there is such a change in me when working well .
&quot; a buzz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the buzz sounds like a v@@ itali@@ zing road , I could go forever on her . &quot;
&quot; many people assume , if I declare to them the buzz , that I am writing that writing is joy . &quot;
don &apos;t understand me wrong that does it .
&quot; but the buzz -- when I began working with television production , when I began to work and work and work to create , create and collaborate , I discovered this thing , this buzz , this energy . &quot;
the buzz is more than writing .
the buzz is action and activity . the buzz is a drug .
the buzz is music . the buzz is light and air .
the buzz is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; if you have such a buzz , then you can no longer strive than the size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling , not to be different than to strive for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the buzz .
or perhaps it is also a work@@ a@@ holic .
perhaps it is called a genius .
perhaps it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I just know that I am not for the failure , and I just know that I love the buzz . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; to make clear : the more successful I will , the more transm@@ issions , the more dis@@ connected borders , the more work there , the more things the same time , the more I write history , the more expectations there is . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to succeed , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what about work ?
I love work but not true ?
&quot; the country that I create , the mar@@ athon which I run , the army , the linen , the high tone , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz . &quot;
I like this buzz . I love the buzz .
I need the buzz . I am the buzz .
am I only this buzz ?
and then stop the buzz .
&quot; revised , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned . &quot;
the buzz stops .
&quot; now my three daughters are accu@@ stom@@ ed to the truth , that her mother is a single employer . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my m@@ ama will not be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; an estim@@ ation , I would like to go to Sh@@ onda land . &quot;
these are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the buzz heard . &quot;
the buzz of the engine was conce@@ aled .
I did not love my job anymore . the engine was out .
the Sum@@ mas did not come back .
my buzz was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours days , finished weekend , no re@@ mor@@ se , no re@@ mor@@ row , nothing to deleg@@ ate , is not up , with whol@@ eh@@ ear@@ t@@ edly , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no one .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV @-@ programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV @-@ programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a pre @-@ show @-@ ti@@ tan@@ ium
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the buzz and the buzz .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work that you love , suddenly fade ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think , &quot; gras@@ shop@@ per you , stupid author @-@ ti@@ tan@@ ium . &quot;
&quot; but you know you are doing it , you are working to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker to be a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love one another and that gives one of the buzz when you know the buzz , who has stopped the buzz , who is then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; ask me a question .
&quot; I am on the way outside , late off and she says , &quot; M@@ om , do you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I just want to say no , when two things shall be aware of : &quot;
&quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she did not named me . &quot;
it does not call anyone more &quot; estimates . &quot;
when is this happening ?
&quot; I love it when I am ti@@ tan@@ ium and my buzz , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this is nothing special .
we play and her sisters come across and we laugh a lot and I read completely dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of Sum@@ ming , I can do nothing except to fit . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the country that I create , the mar@@ athon which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists is sti@@ cky finger and wet , delicate voices , juni@@ pers and the song in which it is to leave , or whatever the girl put into &quot; &quot; The Iron Queen &quot; . &quot; &quot;
everywhere peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes up and a energy @-@ ub comes in .
&quot; and that is not immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the buzz is slowly coming back .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it is silent , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the buzz , but a buzz . &quot;
&quot; and now I feel , as if I know a magical secret . &quot;
but let us stay with the matter .
it is love . that is all .
no magic . no secret .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the buzz , the labour @-@ sum , the ti@@ tan@@ ium @-@ sum ; this is only the substitute . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself with broad@@ casts and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real buzz . &quot;
the buzz is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it is dependent on the joy .
the real buzz is dependent on love .
the buzz is the stream that comes from the lust of life .
real buzz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real buzz ignor@@ es the pressure of the story , the performing jobs , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real buzz is simple and original .
&quot; the real buzz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but maybe they whis@@ pered with God the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a ti@@ tan@@ ium ? &quot;
it is simply love .
&quot; all of us need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
I do make it a solid rule so I can free myself as a work@@ a@@ holic of any guilt .
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice but if I want to hear the buzz . &quot;
&quot; I wish it was so simple . I am not good in games , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; if I am not playing , this is how they work . &quot;
&quot; the truth does hurt , &quot;
but I like it to play .
I work always because I love it .
I am rather at the workplace as home .
&quot; this input is painful , because what a human being works better than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well , yes . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
&quot; we ras@@ en in the garden around , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
&quot; I mainly feel stiff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always take you to my mobile phone .
but it is OK .
&quot; my children show me how you live , and the buzz of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we ever stopped working with the games ?
you can also do it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you hold me for na@@ ï@@ ve , for a dre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; you have probably right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child finds you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my kids want to play a maximum of 15 minutes with me , until they are fu@@ elled that they want to make something different . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes replaced me a Mari@@ ak@@ ter or K@@ eks .
&quot; and he speaks my teen@@ ager @-@ daughter all 15 minutes long with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it is only 15 minutes , more needs it not . &quot;
&quot; everyone can put 15 minutes on the piece , even at a bad mood day ! &quot;
15 minutes at the piece !
&quot; no mobile , no laundry , no distr@@ action . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children beg@@ ged . &quot;
but 15 minutes are in it !
&quot; my children are my dear , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is said to feel the buzz , to have a place for his soul peace . &quot;
&quot; it is not about playing with their own children . it is a pleasure , &quot;
the &quot; play &quot; in general .
allow yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find it out and keep it yourself .
&quot; I am not perfect in it . I fail and I victories . friends meet , read books that enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; want to play ? &quot; &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show , when I was a ti@@ tan@@ ium in training , when I wanted to meet even more and more . &quot;
15 minutes at the piece why not full 15 minutes of indul@@ ge ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the buzz came back in my spare time . the buzz seems to be returning if I am not working .
working is not working without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens in , and I find myself in my office again . I hear a familiar melody , she meets me and my soul . she seduc@@ es me into new ideas . I use it in full and love my work again . &quot;
&quot; I like the buzz , but I do not love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the buzz ; the buzz is not me ... not anymore .
&quot; soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is now my buzz .
the Sum@@ mon of Life .
the buzz of love .
&quot; the sums of work is part of me , but just a part . and so I am so grateful . &quot;
&quot; it is me schn@@ u@@ ppe that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and nevertheless I have everything in hand . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fire burn even .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel like a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more clear is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the buzz . the land that I create , the mar@@ athon which I run , the bare walls , the strong , the buzz , the sw@@ amp , the other , the right sums : the buzz of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this buzz , the more this unusual , effective , naked and new feeling of life in me broad . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this buzz , the more I know who I am . &quot;
I am author . I think things from and I awaken you to life .
&quot; this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream @-@ job should be a little dre@@ amy .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and more games .
tit@@ ans have no chance .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thanks nice .
I am neuro@@ surgical in neuro@@ surgery .
&quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies . &quot;
&quot; I know how to change your life from one second to another , after a serious stroke , or after an accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ surgeon , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , heavy disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I use functional Neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a physician who is trying to improve the nerve functions by various surgical interventions .
&quot; they certainly have heard of one of the best @-@ known ones , the &quot; &quot; Tie@@ fen@@ hir@@ ing stimulation &quot; . &quot; it im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neurological function improved . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson who suffered severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
&quot; I would like to show you , that we are very close to you . &quot;
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a guide and worked day and night in the emergency .
often I served people with skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma .
they must imagine that at sk@@ ulls @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ mat@@ a the bra@@ ins s@@ wimm@@ ers and cran@@ ial pressure increases .
&quot; to save life , you have to dimin@@ ish the skull pressure . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is sometimes necessary to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain &apos;s mass . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; cells from a gun to grow are comparable to all small children , that can be removed from your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and environments to thri@@ ve them . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts there were Jean @-@ François .
this is what he saw under his micro@@ scope .
it was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
perhaps you know from the bi@@ olog@@ ist teaching that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can transform themselves into every cell type of the organism .
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it &apos;s surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are immortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they slowly split and after a couple of weeks they even died .
&quot; thus , we saw a new , strange cell population who looked like stem cells but had changed differently . &quot;
we needed long to understand where they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our large @-@ stag cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they ensure the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know this .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find it in higher concentrations near brain injuries . &quot;
but this is not so sure .
one thing is clear however -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
&quot; we stand in front of a potential cell source , which allows brain healing . &quot;
this is what we had to prove .
&quot; so , we decided to develop an experiment . &quot;
we wanted to find a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ language area and then cultiv@@ ate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François
and they are then color @-@ coloured in order to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we re@@ im@@ planted it at the top of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ ologist Tran@@ splan@@ tation - Aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we re@@ im@@ itate these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we re@@ im@@ itate the same cells in the brain brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkeys .
&quot; in the first scenario we re@@ im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely , they go back home . the space is already occupied , so they will not go there , so disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we added a violation and re@@ im@@ planted just the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you can see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were re@@ im@@ planted .
the evidence that they show are these small points . these are the cells that we paint in vit@@ ro in the culture .
here we could not stop .
would these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain damage ?
&quot; so , we designed monkeys with a manual de@@ preci@@ ation task . &quot;
they had to take feed@@ pel@@ lets from a tray .
they made them very well .
&quot; when they had reached a stable squ@@ ad level , we last in the motor@@ ic cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move her hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in people , they spontaneously recovered up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover from plasti@@ fic@@ tional brain mechanisms . they can relax to some extent , just like the monkey . &quot;
&quot; as we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left side they see the monkey , which spontaneously recovered . &quot;
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original output from injury .
he is not as precise and not so fast .
&quot; now when we see the cells re@@ im@@ planted , the same axis , two months after the ad@@ plantation . &quot;
&quot; I can tell you , these were also very exciting results for us . &quot;
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can use it freezing and later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example with Parkinson &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; however , our dream is still to im@@ itate them in humans . &quot;
&quot; I really hope that I can show you soon , how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself . &quot;
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that is wonderful , I am sure that several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who may need . &quot;
I will definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest barriers are before you can start clinical trials on humans . &quot;
&quot; Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest barriers are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill in about two kilograms of papers and forms , in order to go through this kind of studies . &quot;
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a nearly professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried the permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes to get into hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : this is hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will it allow us the authority to launch it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it needs a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , one has to apply it to a multi @-@ centric study . &quot;
&quot; first , one must really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment each . &quot;
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : natural . &quot;
&quot; BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it . &quot;
BG : many thanks .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
&quot; we see democracy not as the fragile plant that it is in reality , but as inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider it as an un@@ changeable relationship .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have du@@ bi@@ ased that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impres@@ sing growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the democracy in us , in Europe . &quot;
at the beginning of the year when I re@@ presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ ambig@@ uous me that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- not to influence the austerity programs that have been realized in Greece .
&quot; at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , or the Communist Party of China , or some of my read@@ ings to me that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to introduce an economic model for real democracy .
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save us democracy but that we need a tru@@ sive and helpl@@ ess democracy . &quot;
&quot; because without democracy our societies become one , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies is wasted . &quot;
&quot; on the topic of extravag@@ ance , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction at present our economies at present . &quot;
I call it the &quot; twin @-@ top paradox . &quot;
&quot; one summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the Schul@@ den@@ berg , who casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the Scho@@ den@@ berg , &quot;
but only a few recognize its Gem@@ ini .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the high net of as@@ parag@@ us and corporations , which could be too anxi@@ ous to invest there where it would be productive and income to produce all of the things that mankind is urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past 3 months , in the United States , in England and the euro , 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion U.S. dollars have been investing in all the prosperity of manufacturing plants , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion U.S. dollar sounds after a lot of money , until one compar@@ es it with the 5,@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion U.S. dollars , which were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to do except the stock exchanges and the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , debts and un@@ productive capital are the twin @-@ tops that are not equal through the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result are stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year olds in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , which , as in an end loop , support the pes@@ si@@ mis@@ m of investors interested in which they do not invest . just as Ö@@ di@@ pus father , who is out of fear , the prophecy of O@@ ra@@ k@@ els might be true that his son will kill him if he will grow , &quot;
&quot; invol@@ un@@ tarily , the circumstances will cause it k@@ ills him k@@ ills him . &quot;
this is my hatred with capitalism --
&quot; his extremely competitive art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and to especially finance the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for saving the Earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
I think already . but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Ar@@ ist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the social form of society in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy of course closed too many --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to min@@ ate the significance of the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy because of these inclu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the decision @-@ making of the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it was involved with the working poor and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and more important that they put them the right to political participation with the same vocal range in issues related to the state . &quot;
the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not kept long ago --
&quot; like a candle , which lights very bright , it is also quickly spread . &quot;
&quot; however , our present @-@ liberal democracies have not its roots in the ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was concentrated on the free citizens and the working poor strengthened , our liberal democracy based on the values of Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for the ruling class . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and the economy is possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy - that is , the world of corporations -- a democratic @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in our present democracies have been held since the point in which this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two instead of moving the economy and depri@@ ved it . &quot;
do you wonder why politicians are no longer like before ?
it is not due to the degeneration of its DNA .
it is because it can be in the government nowadays and still not in power because the power of politics is ab@@ ander@@ ed into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hatred with capitalism .
&quot; when you think about it , it is in about as much as a flock of carni@@ vor@@ es which so sustain@@ ably the animals , of which they are nour@@ ished , under@@ stated that they are therefore star@@ ving . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is similar to the economy that the politics becomes so far can@@ ni@@ ised that it increases with the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of corporations increases , inequality increases , the overall economic demand falls and the general manager of the corporations are to be fri@@ ghtened to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism the &quot; demos &quot; &#91; the people &#93; comes from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the wast@@ age of human labour @-@ power and the prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that &apos;s true , it is obvious that we have to bring together the politics and the economy and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; control re@@ tains control , so as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
this is by the way no new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go well .
the teaching from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only reg@@ ain a position as in the ancient Athens without creating new types of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is one solution : to create the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers through automation and robot .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , the automation can be higher , the wast@@ age sublime and social conflicts deeper , just as it is - very soon as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; we must therefore re@@ forming the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and in this respect we end up in a path@@ ological hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentation . &quot;
&quot; so , the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements which he has produced , will survive -- &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is similar to a d@@ yst@@ one , similar to the &quot; matrix &quot; , &quot; in which machines serve the people and people put their energy into the research of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks about the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we may be optim@@ istic .
&quot; so what br@@ ats it , how could it look like this &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; - good utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar D@@ yst@@ sc@@ opy ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies , please make a capital market in which you deserve money while you work and in which your capital follows you from a job to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- regardless of which one is currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company . &quot;
&quot; then , in@@ comes from capital and rede@@ em and the concept of wage labour is completely obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but they do not work in it , and employees who work there , but no exchange between investment and austerity , no large gaps between investment and austerity , and ultimately no em@@ por@@ ous twin @-@ tops . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy , please indicate that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency that is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest Emer@@ gency &#93; , in the interest of the whole of mankind . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the entire world trade is acted in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos , &quot; -- and each government pays the sum of the trade defic@@ it or the commercial excess of the respective country , into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund is invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment is rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have them , in particular before the background of a unified policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe to you is a liber@@ alisation , in which they preferred people , and Marxist because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ ically , globally key@@ n@@ esi@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy . &quot;
we will awaken in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar D@@ yst@@ sc@@ opy ?
the answer depends on how we live politically .
&quot; it is in our hands , and we do it better democratic . &quot;
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography even as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and the economy is ... doing this not , technological development will produce a massive decline in overall economic demand that Larry Sum@@ mer describes as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the transfer of this crisis from a part of the earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our democracies , but also the countries whose interest in liber@@ ational democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is correct , then Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; as well as Hay@@ ek , so I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and so I am also perfect . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are too . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you do not , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers , you have said very clearly what you have from the point of view of the West to China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ crisy .
in our liberal democracies we have the appearance of democracy .
&quot; as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy to politics while the area where most of the economy is off , -- the area of economy -- an entirely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in a certain sense , if I must say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically speaking . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stuart Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what can be observed now in China , resembles very the development we had in England during the Industrial Revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; now , China is now prefer@@ able to do what the West has done in the 19th century , smells huge after hypo@@ crisy . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many list@@ eners are curious about your experiences as finance minister in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I noticed that it comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half @-@ year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very disappointing , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the eurozone &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely to adopt the self @-@ suffici@@ ency , and the persever@@ ing denial was that a massive displ@@ ac@@ ement line through the euro zone ran , and continues to massi@@ vely increase the development of the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity to read on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal that revealed this denial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately it is correct to do . unfortunately , the powers within the euro zone , within the European group , continues to vote the denial . &quot;
yet you know what to come .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you try to get an economic system that is not viable , through political will and authorit@@ ari@@ anism in life , it might be delayed for a while , but when the change happens , it happens ab@@ rupt and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change their structure .
BG : did you have any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seriously ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister , or any minister , that after 6 months in office , especially in such a tense situation , claims that he made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the greatest mistake was to under@@ sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
&quot; I believed that there was an honest interest in the don@@ ors , to find a common solution . &quot;
but that was not .
&quot; they just wanted to bring our government to the case , just because they did not want to deal with the ver@@ sion@@ ers who were walking through the eurozone . &quot;
they didn &apos;t want to conc@@ ede that it had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; none from the Troika &apos;s tro@@ ika credi@@ tors gave us this policy , and a : &quot; that was a col@@ oss@@ al mistake . &quot; &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive T@@ ons of the conversations , you seem to be still quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone did not survive .
&quot; for if they did not survive , the un@@ cover@@ ings will be demon@@ ic and the European Union will destroy . &quot;
&quot; this will not be disa@@ strous for Europe , but for the whole world economy . &quot;
we are probably the most powerful economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to hit the path of post @-@ modern 1930 , according to what it appears to me , it will be equally unbe@@ arable for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong in that point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for having been with TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thanks .
&quot; Roy Price never heard most of them , although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
&quot; Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the TV @-@ production company of Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a sp@@ ook@@ y and describes Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for providing the shows and content to produce Amazon .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard hit industry . &quot;
there are already so many TV series that Roy cannot choose any one .
&quot; he must find shows that are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are on the right of this curve . &quot;
this curve is the applicants distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows you get this review .
&quot; will your show be rated with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; &quot; Breaking Bad &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; -- all the shows , who are addic@@ ted where , after having asked a season to ask your brain : &quot; &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left hand side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at that end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not need to get into the left side of the curve , because I think it needs special intelligence to accommodate &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the average endurance , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they just inspire not . &quot;
&quot; so , he must make sure that he really is on the right side . &quot;
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes such a thing , so Roy Price does not want to risk . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses by an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and sets them online where everyone can watch them for free . &quot;
&quot; and when Amazon is out there for nothing , it is right ? &quot;
millions of spectators have a look at these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed at the watch of these shows . &quot;
they are observed by Roy and his team who take up everything .
&quot; you capture when to start the show , when you look at , which parts you are ski@@ pped or again . &quot;
&quot; they collect millions of data to decide with this data , which show you should produce . &quot;
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process these and this results in response , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com about four Republican US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- hence something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time with another company , another manager has placed a top @-@ show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super @-@ show and he also uses data for it , but he does it a little different . &quot;
&quot; instead of holding a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data on Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the reviews that they give the shows , their course , what shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use these data to find out these little details about the spectators , which shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a Sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators but a drama series on a Senator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has borrowed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets an 9,1 rating on this curve . thus , exactly where they wanted to go . &quot;
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; it has two very competitive , data sealed firms . &quot;
they combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
what is that ?
because logic somehow means that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data for a decision you meet , then you should make a good decision . &quot;
one has 200 years at statistics as Back @-@ up .
one optimized it thanks to very powerful computers .
&quot; the least thing you can expect is good TV , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis is not working , then this is something terri@@ fying because we live in a time in which we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television . &quot;
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody in this room ever comes in touch with this software . come in touch with it you are in prison .
&quot; if any one is here in the US in prison and ask for dism@@ iss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dism@@ iss@@ al is made or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of choosing whether a show will be good or bad , a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; television , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
&quot; this is not always the best results , it is not that a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data . &quot;
the data of the most reputable companies are also wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; Google announced that it can pre@@ dict through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the worse way , can pre@@ dict -- by data analysis of the Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderful and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked perfectly , year round year , until it suddenly did not work , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it was simply not working , it was once again a sensation , including the withdrawal of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even data sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data stream into decisions of life - at work , at the workplace , in case of law , in medicine . &quot;
&quot; so , we prefer to ensure that data is helpful . &quot;
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ assisted genetics -- an area , where some very clever people are uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able to use many data to make serious decisions about how to make decisions for cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a drug . over the years I have identified some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; you define this problem in its parts , so you can analyse the items ; as a set , you set up the parts again to write a decision . &quot;
sometimes you have to do this several times but there are always two things to take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help you to dis@@ integrate a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to put together the parts again and then come to a decision .
&quot; for this , there is another tool and we all have it : our brain . &quot;
&quot; when there is something that &apos;s good in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to put together again , even if the information is incomplete in order to then hold a good decision - especially when it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s why I think it was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have used data and minds , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use the data to better understand their audience , which otherwise they would not have been able to put together , but the decision on how to put all these parts again and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; does not stand in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon on the other hand did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when they chose TV ideas , then when they elected &quot; Alpha House &quot; as the show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; we tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe that things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful them are , data are just a tool and not to forget that , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will be ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the tool for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; magic 8 ball &quot; . it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely , &quot; right here at that moment . &quot;
I will return it later with a technique @-@ demo .
&quot; so far I met some decisions in my life , whereby I should listen to the ball in the afternoon . &quot;
&quot; however , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace them through something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not change the basic structure . &quot;
&quot; maybe the ball is wis@@ er and clever , and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right corner . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as very encouraging news that in spite of the large amount of data still pays off , decisions to meet , an expert in what you do , and risks . &quot;
&quot; for in the end there is not the data , but the risks , with which you end up at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thanks nice .
