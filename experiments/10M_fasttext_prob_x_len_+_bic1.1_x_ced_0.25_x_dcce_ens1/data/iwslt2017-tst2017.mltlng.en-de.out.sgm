<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before any one heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which it is spectacular, that the NSA is illegal telephones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">"however, it is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, in which the CIA was literally drained for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an unbelievable story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know whom the chapter did not fall?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for nearly 10 years, the government fought against the signs and asked him to name his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this train, he became a symbol for the pattern of government, whistleblowers to condemn and journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to First Amendment, the media have the right to publish information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to use this right, if the media does not get this information and if they are not able to protect the identity of the mule they give."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government broke out at Risen, he did something which many courageous reporters said before him: he refused, and said he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"so from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"however, just days before the trial, something else happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they were written for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government have been abandoned."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters can and sources can always hide away.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rather than fail to fail, rather than to fail, this could also do its digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigator, without his consent, his call, secretive,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his e-mail data, financial and banker information, its lending, and even travel-wise with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblowers and risens allegedly."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect his steps, whistleblowers. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government has too much of its work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11 almost every article about national security has been the result of that a whistle-blowers went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we set up the press work on the game, which should be protected by the first constitutional complaints, because the government has more and more possibilities to send all of them."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as technology allowed the government to handle the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"while they can get in touch with it from the moment in which they contact, instead of the night, in witness."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software that has not yet been written as a roisen book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source-source system for whistleblowers, which was originally developed by the internet-famous, which was developed by us, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I work."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, just like any ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server which only has access to the respective News Agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot secretly erased a lot of information, and many of the information they would call it would not be available."</seg>
<seg id="36">"but, SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole, to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments all over the world develop new espion technologies that endanger us."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is to make sure that not only technology-denominator like Edward Snowden have a way to put iniquities. it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"he wants to tell about the grievances in the care of soldiers and wants to report about overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental worker, the alarm goes for polluted water from Flint. or a Wallstreet insider that warns us in front of the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover the crime, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the largest data leck of the story was published.] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that kingdoms and powerful] [we bade Robert Palmer from Global Witness hidden by Global Witness.] This week we were resident of messages over a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mosseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossy Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works, as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to a very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands prime minister is receded.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that a allies of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has letops in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is said that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin is conducting a tight friend from children's days, a famous Cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous to wait for the next release, and the next revealed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now this sounds like the plot of a studio-rillers or John-Grisham's novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems cries away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we address this?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is, if the rich and mighty are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not to pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, streets."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in all over the world media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used by some few to hide, their assets hide and disguise -- something that we have been discussing for ten years and reveal."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it is difficult to understand how this tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it as a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so, one has a company in a different company, in another company, in a further firm, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these commandments."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for prosecutions and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really understand what thing is."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting too that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably, because there had been no more prominent Americans who had passed this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now, it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"however, due to the principle according to which this tax havens work, Mosse Fonseca has fewer American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"could we have a data leck of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that you need less information in some US states to specify less information to create a company than a librarian."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of infusion in the US has allowed employees to release schoolchildren to release schoolchildren.</seg>
<seg id="69">"" "it does not allow frauds to extract especially vulnerable investors."</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does that work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a twisted investigator in the offices of 13 Anwaltsfirms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator gave herself as an African minister, who wanted to bring double money to the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"we really shocked, it really shocked that all the up to a lawyer of our investigators make suggestions as he could transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all premeetings. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course anybody was handed over to the money. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individuals.</seg>
<seg id="78">"it is not about a single attorney, who has been instructed by our covered investigators."</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single leaders, entangled into a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through the corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we must change the rules of rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound everything very dull as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing had ever changed, as if it is always the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as a born optimist, I see that a lot has begun to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen violations of greater transparency in the past few years, as far as the owners of companies are concerned."</seg>
<seg id="86">The issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has captured in central registers at the national level, who really lies behind companies in Europe, and who has controlled them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA is lagging behind here.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have earned a draft law in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people who become angry, when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="93">We need executives in the economy to get up and say: "Intransparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">"we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and stand up for it, by laws this kind of intransparent."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finally end the infusion, which now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I was almost kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Mazdas."</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I completed my design study, I made a backyard selling."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda remained and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country. afterwards he would go to the peace of peace.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me excited about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I became tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him," "Where are you looking for this day?" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing worse:" "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know whether he really is planning. I don't want to go up in the trunk of a Mazet!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"then I heard myself:" "I have a lilo. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," "h, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," Oh man! what did I get there? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A game-strange is sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is mad?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I was given such a fear that I went out of bed, on top-pointed tips to the door, and my sleeping room closed."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">"the work of art, which he bought from me, is today in his classroom. he is now a teacher."</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my view.</seg>
<seg id="121">"maybe the people who were sold to me in childhood as strangers were really friends, who just waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"to accommodate people on my airmat was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air barrier."</seg>
<seg id="123">"we make a time, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost pleite, my roommate draws and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I think creativity can create it, anxiety in fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" "Brian, I overlays out how we could make something like this. our apartment is equipped with a designer bed-and-breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including breakfast, a mattress and every morning breakfast."</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">"we created a website and founded so" "Airmat and Breakfast" "[AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb]."</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the airmat on woodflooring.</seg>
<seg id="131">"they found it great, and we too."</seg>
<seg id="132">"I am sure to decorate our cheese-ham-omelet completely different, because we made them for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them all over the city. when we passed our last guest and fell into the castle the door closed down to the castle.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay for our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things arrived in the reels.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented ourselves to investors:" we want to create a website where people are public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room, whose doors are closed when visiting. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"via the Internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them at night."</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile would be.</seg>
<seg id="142">"in fact, it is not."</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still with consolation would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children have all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you agree on the things you can well. we could designate."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and tactile -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we learned how to construct objects, but now we wanted to create an immense trust between people who have never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design do such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">"I would like to give you a sample, which degree you trust us."</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfort.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">"now, I would like to block that you unlock your mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlock mobile phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">"this quiet approach to panic, which you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door the first time."</seg>
<seg id="158">"for the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone, is your home."</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlock sound of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most are the responsibility of the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"so, most guests feel when they stay elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="163">Only because of this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"only then, who now has Al Gores cell phone?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please tell us on Twitter that he was canceled for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build up. I would like to share with you some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a small detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbour would have presented only once with his name, when he told, Whence he comes, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"imagine you would have 150 assessments, which all say:" "he can really hold very well unned mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system strengthens confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to leave negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">"ultimately, we decided to wait until both hosts and visiting their judgements, before we set them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we carried out a study with Stanford a study. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are at age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprising we trust the people most who are similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social biases.</seg>
<seg id="181">"it is exciting when you add the call to a person -- in our case by assessments."</seg>
<seg id="182">"if one has less than three judgments, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but one has more than ten, it changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation among similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preference.</seg>
<seg id="186">"furthermore, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get out of it."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little, like" Hi! "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells a lot, as for example:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request will also be rather not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, such as" Tolle artworks in your apartment! I do this with my family holiday. "</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design to produce this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">"we use the size of the text field, to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something."</seg>
<seg id="193">"our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help, overcome our prejudices against strangers."</seg>
<seg id="194">"what we did not expect, the large amount of people who were more than prepared to dissolve these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, incredibly much luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">"second, the tireless work of our team."</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, a demand that had not been covered previously."</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business runs very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have been unauthorised parties and have devastated homes.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts will leave guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with the customer service. all calls came directly on my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">"I stood at the forefront, when trust has been broken."</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it already hurts when I only think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the caller was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, there had only a fraction of the 123 million remaining nights only a fraction ever."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other right.</seg>
<seg id="210">"when confidence works, there can be miraculous."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host went him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is its assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travellers who tend to have a heart attack due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra be true guardian angels who save one life even though they do not know one thing.</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive a car into the hospital, when you die, and wait, while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they do not want you to feel lonely, they bring books over."</seg>
<seg id="220">Let you stay one even longer without charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">This is of course not all your stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to reach with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled upon this concept for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but it is now simply called" "flat industry", "the thing is not justified."</seg>
<seg id="228">"Share Economy describes a trade, human relationships promises."</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay a part of itself open and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"traveling nowadays, it is possible to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">What if traveling were a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if in every place you visited, a group there would wait to wait a group there and to show a thoroughly pentagrarian neighborhood of which one has never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to share apartments from the ground up to the intersequence?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities were to accept the thoughts of the common part?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships, instead of loneliness and shutdowns."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korean capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking places included in the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">"were now offered to the inhabitants. students, who were looking for a place,"</seg>
<seg id="241">Were given to people whose children were labelled.</seg>
<seg id="242">"in order to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people will be host in 191 countries as a guest at a foreign or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be not as crazy as it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality were also before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There have been similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from luck and timing, we realize that you can find the right design with the components of the trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome profound prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I find that amazingly,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">"I have to think about this, when a red Mazda is passing by me."</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we are able to use it for."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you see me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, a brainwashing, a terrorist group?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just delay a delay at the airport at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is actually true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">Thus the media people represent what look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study revealed that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean, most would not know Muslims. "</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not speak with their Uber riders.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met some Muslims: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">"a seagulls, fitness-fanatikerin,"</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslimin."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17 years old, I met the decision to outen me."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual man, as some of my friends, but as Muscat. I chose to wear the Hijab, my headgear."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist friends were horrified," "Why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was: back then it was a feminist declaration of independence, and to the pressure I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt me to a perfect and unreachable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read him, thought to question, posed in question, doubtful and believed ultimately."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow dedication that deepened with every reading of the object.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm brings me sometimes to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I know myself about it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"ever had you ever feel that somebody perceives you, you fully understand, and yet somehow loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and began as all the good Egyptians, my career as engineers."</seg>
<seg id="289">"I had later, after my marriage, a child, and basically lived the" "Egyptian-American dream". ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that dreadful morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had dinner at the end, looked on the screen and saw the word" Eillogon. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"smoke, airplanes flew in buildings, people spikes out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly into rebellion.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do something like this?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I changed the television channel and heard:..." Muslim terrorists,... "..." in the name of Islam... "..."... jihad... ""... "bombted Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only my country to attack, but in the Nu the acts of others turned into a suspects."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Middle West of the United States to move into a new city and start studying the building."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I was silent -- when we were silent -- so deep it went in my seat, and I feared the first time to be recognized as Muslimin."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we went to our apartment in this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then heard, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said," "be vigilant," "soothed in good illuminated areas," "samplush you not."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week indoors.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday that week -- the day in which Muslims gathered for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" "not on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage of the media.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard of attacks to Muslims or from people who held for Muslims to freeze."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really brands on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay home.</seg>
<seg id="313">"however, something did not feel right."</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who had attacked this country have attacked our land.</seg>
<seg id="315">I got the anger of the people away on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain itself constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the allegations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"nowadays, we can actually say people:" there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims. "</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go on? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to join Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It only raises the question: are we malicious or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumours as a whole and a benign tumor is only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is false.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, agents and Olympiad."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America be more secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there will be some parking free, but not stop terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit to a mosque leads to the people of other faith, and to show greater citizenship."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the Washington, DC was recently reported: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"the radicalisation process has found that it will start online. as a first, the person can cut off their church, even by their family, so that the person who believes the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and their ideology is a traitor, or their ideology."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS substantiated its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as musliin, as a mother, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">Yet we would like to add to their imagination when you acknowledge them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology in their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when one casts a look at it, she does not pass on what they spoke in their" Holy Scripture. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is its brutality that they can read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An exceptionally Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">"a girl came to him, because she would have imagined the IS."</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was exactly the opposite. every spiritual one had spoken to her, she brought her to silence and told her that her wrath would bring her mind to the injustice in the world, she would only bring her mind into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that had given sense to their anger, it was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists that promised you a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam put the connection to God and her church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accuse them for their fury, he showed her constructive ways for real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, she kept her to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how the Islamophobia me and my family concerns.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect every other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear each day affect our democracy on our minds?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies - show: when we fear that at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we accept more an authorized government system, conformity and prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study reveals that if you have Tested messages in which negative about Muslims was reported, they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"when you look when the mood against Muslims ended up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in advance of the Iraq war and two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"thus, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected it."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool for manipulation of public to be the foundation of a free society, which has sensible and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling of Moslems is an early warning mark.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear gives us all of us."</seg>
<seg id="368">"at the assignment of collectivation, it is not just about to explain itself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both of them went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was at the dental Faculty, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would say to me that he was the sweetest, the most generous man, whom she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was flabbergasted and she said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is of my flock, such a sealed young man has become?"</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne's visit to her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she assassinated, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was in the afternoon, as with a execution, having posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page."</seg>

<seg id="377">Fanaticism can be not only immoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque or stayed there safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we prays it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about that America we want to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can exercise our religion freely."</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's seat we drove silently, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, took my shoes off, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw, left me."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and called our guests, for half of the assembled were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came to join us, but to assist us."</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I am collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go to number sure?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you connect to those who mean: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Many thanks.</seg>

<seg id="395">"Helen Walters: well Dalia, you seem to have met a Nerv."</seg>

<seg id="407">"what began as a platform for Basters, is about to become a milliardenbusiness."</seg>
<seg id="408">"monitoring, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial threats."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air conditioner in our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the Frac Centre in France has built a six meter high tower of 1 500 bricks. a few years ago they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">Interconnecting cables reach high speed and acceleration on the narrowest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-saving structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads with turmoil and in general respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to cross the borders of the possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"so that a system works autonomously, it must know collectively, where in the space the mobile objects are located."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects, which allows us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic Tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, an offshoot of our laboratories."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"every airmachine has internal sensors, to determine the position in the room, which should determine what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external orders are available at the highest level. for example," "start" "and" "landing". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called hapstarter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other Starrwings, it is efficient in the ahead flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most of the starters, it can soars, and thus has great benefits at startup and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">However there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of happoints is that they respond sensitively to turbulence such as wind-bows.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight device doesn't matter in which position the optimal position has attained and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often face basic abstract questions related to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the smaller number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">"helicopters are known as machines with a thousand movable parts, which work together to hurt you."</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly away-controlled air equipment, which only had two mobile parts: a propeller and a tailgate."</seg>
<seg id="435">"recently, we discovered that flying with only one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monoginner, the mechanically simple remote-served aircraft. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only a movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and cross-herds, no further Stellisances or controllers, just a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, happens in the interior a lot, so that it can fly stable and move in space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the Hecky. to bring it to flying, I have to put it right correctly."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood of throwing it exactly right if all of them see is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monoginner is an exercise in pleasure, this machine is here, the Omnikopter with its eight Propeller, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is symmetrically.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"thus, he receives the most beautiful ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"move in space in all directions, no matter what direction he rotate or even like it rotating."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight Propeller."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some is present in models, the rest will be acquired directly at flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and secure."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate twin-propeller engines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns on clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the others against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"if you build them together, they behave like a high-performance quadcopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something wrong -- a motor or propeller goes out, electronics or battery - can continue to fly the machine if restricted."</seg>
<seg id="457">"we will now demonstrate, by doing a half plane."</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examined synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took the sweet Micro-Quadcopter -- each individual weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you will motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine is over-over and wants to be a fluke lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">For guys like us there is wages in the development and the creation.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that there are creative, clever creatures allowed to form it in such a spectacular fashion."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive industrial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="469">"before 1.3 billion years ago, two black holes revolves each other in a very far distant galaxy, the mass of three suns in a tenths of tart in pure energy."</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they shining brighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the whole of us-known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But her energy does not set her in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into the space-time structure and exploded the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">More than 1.3 billion years ago the life of the Earth had just emerged.</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, saurier, people and -- God stand by us -- even the internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group especially courageous -- Rai Weiss was decided by MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- to search for gravitational-waves, which are formed approximately by collide black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most they thought for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">"but enough people realized it as a crazy geniuses, so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed their idea."</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, construction, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector LIGO: the Laser-Interferomometer-gravitational Observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the follow-up time, the precision of LIGO could greatly increase what the recognition-performance was enormous."</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is now called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015 LIGO was launched for a last test, to clarify some smaller, persistent problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two collidizing black holes is through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my todsick Father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically this were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">"all that which I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he studied for 23 years gravitational-waves out of black holes and their observatories such as LIGO measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a cabling in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when temporary the wave, the space and its entire content are covered in one direction and the other stretched out."</seg>
<seg id="495">"to illustrate, lecturers in courses of relativity-theory often leads to a properly albering dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and storage, stretching and crawling."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational-waves extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on 14 September, for example, each of us was stretched on the shakes of the waves and stacked the stretching of an average man was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that is, 20 Nullen after the comma, followed by a 1. the LIGO employees declared crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five-kilometer long laser detector, and that is absurd, this length would have to be measured on less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. this is grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"described Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties when building such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"however, physicists are inventive and with the support of the public will certainly overcome all obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne released this since 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott likes to say LIGO is more of an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your mobile phones. "</seg>
<seg id="508">That's quite convenient. because you can make a picture or a map of things by accepting that of several points coming around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">In sounds that is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to manufacture a picture of things which mean you particularly much:"</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child about.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead we listen to certain properties like tape and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, just Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob stops them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can do not have simple pictures of objects in all of them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">"at least, for LIGO are the measured frequencies in the audible range."</seg>
<seg id="521">"so if we can convert wave-pattern into all, we can hear the All literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"the gravitation to listen, can tell us about a lot about the collision of two black holes, so my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"sh: two black, non rotatable holes, circlamps simply: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"rotate the two bodies very quickly, you can hear the same circuit with an additional sound change. it sounds like that: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement worsening and shapes in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- I heard LIGO Folder: [Surrenof the noise] Jemand, who knows what he must listen to, recognizes this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with the 30-fold sun mass, which can turn around as fast as the sticks of your mixture."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the most dense body in the universe, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve each hundred times per second before it collapses."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces in front of them.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the constant importance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO paved a completely new way of exploring the universe as they never before was possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the All's and the unseen.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can -- practically or basically - not visible.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a super-nova, for example. I would like to know why masserts stars in super-novae explode."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we learned a lot about all of them.</seg>
<seg id="538">"the exciting physical processes happen however at the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through as this opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational-gravitational-waves penetrate iron, as if it were more transparent glass. the jungle is I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it as the jungle is covered by its own seed."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using gravitational-waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"most importantly, I am optimistic that we have never seen all things that we have never seen before and of which we have no idea. things that we can only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"indeed, LIGO found the same in the first attempt that we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars that have seen black holes as LIGO they observes, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are called Saurierknochen for our archaeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"LIGO makes us a completely different point of view of the events in all, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we went out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to LIGO, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in all.</seg>
<seg id="550">"for what could be more beautiful than the primorgue,"</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I rehearsed an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"for a year I would say" Yes, "before whom I feared."</seg>
<seg id="556">"no matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced me" "Yes". ""</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak in public?</seg>
<seg id="558">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to live live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, but yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: this is exactly what I feared, frightened my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"keep my fear, talk, my social fear -- puff, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," changed me. "</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain Yes, that deeply changed my life, to an unexpected species. it started with a question of my youngest."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for inexplicable reasons all."</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she was a waitress from the South.</seg>
<seg id="571">"estimation, I need milk for my beak-up."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she asked me once I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"from then to swear I swear to me always to play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I just do, or where I go, I still tell Yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I am not perfect but I am trying much.</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has an astounding side effect: only recently, I actually understood that the" "Yes" "saws for playing with my children my career."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am author. I think things, awaken you to life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I creed television. I live TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">I am doing TV in a great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible to add 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV-programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">"each stream features hundreds of jobs, which will not exist before."</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a telescope can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">We say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode every nine days, four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollars, television, four TV programs, four hours TV, three episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: show To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my television series are walking each other on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">Around the world my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I have created myself, and not only produced, so, it has to find time, really sticking, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories to tell."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire that burn around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who does that still do?</seg>
<seg id="598">"nobody, this is why I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not like to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it because I know what you think, when the word" author "falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you so all of you who work so hard if you now speak a company, a country or a classroom, a business or budget, so you understand that I don't just talk on the computer and imaginative, and it's true when I say: I understand that it is not about dreaming with a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, everything reality, all blood, everything sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I went into work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it's as if I put troops up, when I painted on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"so, one can find a high tone, lying a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanically, strenuous and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best of it is the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzz starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a vitalizing road, I could go forever on her."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume, if I declare to them the buzz, that I am writing that writing is joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the buzz -- when I began working with television production, when I began to work and work and work to create, create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The buzz is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The buzz is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"if you have such a buzz, then you can no longer strive than the size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling, not to be different than to strive for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it is also a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called a genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I just know that I am not for the failure, and I just know that I love the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make clear: the more successful I will, the more transmissions, the more disconnected borders, the more work there, the more things the same time, the more I write history, the more expectations there is."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to succeed, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work but not true?</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country that I create, the marathon which I run, the army, the linen, the high tone, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then stop the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, overloaded, exaggerated, burned."</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzz stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">"now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth, that her mother is a single employer."</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my mama will not be there, but you can write my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" "an estimation, I would like to go to Shonda land."</seg>
<seg id="646">These are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby-Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the buzz heard."</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzz of the engine was concealed.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not love my job anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The Summas did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours days, finished weekend, no remorse, no remorrow, nothing to delegate, is not up, with wholeheartedly, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no one.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV-programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV-programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a pre-show-titanium</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do if what you do, the work that you love, suddenly fade?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think," grasshopper you, stupid author-titanium. "</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you are doing it, you are working to be a teacher, a banker to be a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love one another and that gives one of the buzz when you know the buzz, who has stopped the buzz, who is then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart stops, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states waitress" ask me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way outside, late off and she says," Mom, do you play? "</seg>
<seg id="673">"and I just want to say no, when two things shall be aware of:"</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she did not named me."</seg>
<seg id="675">It does not call anyone more "estimates."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I love it when I am titanium and my buzz, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," Mom, do you like to play? "</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and her sisters come across and we laugh a lot and I read completely dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in solitude and in the absence of Summing, I can do nothing except to fit."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country that I create, the marathon which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists is sticky finger and wet, delicate voices, junipers and the song in which it is to leave, or whatever the girl put into" "The Iron Queen". ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and a energy-ub comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that is not immediately, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz is slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it is silent, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the buzz, but a buzz."</seg>
<seg id="700">"and now I feel, as if I know a magical secret."</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the buzz, the labour-sum, the titanium-sum; this is only the substitute."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe myself with broadcasts and television hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz."</seg>
<seg id="707">The buzz is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the stream that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">Real buzz is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real buzz ignores the pressure of the story, the performing jobs, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but maybe they whispered with God the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a titanium?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"all of us need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">I do make it a solid rule so I can free myself as a workaholic of any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice but if I want to hear the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it was so simple. I am not good in games, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">"if I am not playing, this is how they work."</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth does hurt,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I like it to play.</seg>
<seg id="724">I work always because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I am rather at the workplace as home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this input is painful, because what a human being works better than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, yes."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" "Titan" "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rasen in the garden around, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I mainly feel stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always take you to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is OK.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how you live, and the buzz of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why did we ever stopped working with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also do it! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you hold me for naïve, for a dreamer."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you have probably right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child finds you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my kids want to play a maximum of 15 minutes with me, until they are fuelled that they want to make something different."</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes replaced me a Mariakter or Keks.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and he speaks my teenager-daughter all 15 minutes long with me, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"it is only 15 minutes, more needs it not."</seg>
<seg id="752">"everyone can put 15 minutes on the piece, even at a bad mood day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes at the piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children begged."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my dear, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is said to feel the buzz, to have a place for his soul peace."</seg>
<seg id="758">"it is not about playing with their own children. it is a pleasure,"</seg>
<seg id="759">The "play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Allow yourself the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and keep it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I am not perfect in it. I fail and I victories. friends meet, read books that enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"want to play?" "is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show, when I was a titanium in training, when I wanted to meet even more and more."</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes at the piece why not full 15 minutes of indulge?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my spare time. the buzz seems to be returning if I am not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working is not working without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens in, and I find myself in my office again. I hear a familiar melody, she meets me and my soul. she seduces me into new ideas. I use it in full and love my work again."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the buzz, but I do not love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the buzz; the buzz is not me... not anymore.</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is now my buzz.</seg>
<seg id="775">The Summon of Life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The buzz of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sums of work is part of me, but just a part. and so I am so grateful."</seg>
<seg id="778">"it is me schnuppe that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, the journey to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And nevertheless I have everything in hand. my brain is still functioning. my campfire burn even.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel like a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the more clear is my head."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the buzz. the land that I create, the marathon which I run, the bare walls, the strong, the buzz, the swamp, the other, the right sums: the buzz of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, effective, naked and new feeling of life in me broad. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this buzz, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">I am author. I think things from and I awaken you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">"this belongs to the job, which means to live his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream-job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgical in neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">"like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how to change your life from one second to another, after a serious stroke, or after an accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeon, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, heavy disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I use functional Neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A physician who is trying to improve the nerve functions by various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">"they certainly have heard of one of the best-known ones, the" "Tiefenhiring stimulation". "it implanted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson who suffered severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">"I would like to show you, that we are very close to you."</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a guide and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I served people with skull-Hirn-Trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that at skulls-Hirn-Traumata the brains swimmers and cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, you have to diminish the skull pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">"therefore, it is sometimes necessary to remove a part of swollen brain."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain's mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"cells from a gun to grow are comparable to all small children, that can be removed from your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and environments to thrive them."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts there were Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">This is what he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">It was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you know from the biologist teaching that stem cells are immature cells that can transform themselves into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It's surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They slowly split and after a couple of weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"thus, we saw a new, strange cell population who looked like stem cells but had changed differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our large-stag cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they ensure the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find it in higher concentrations near brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear however -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">"we stand in front of a potential cell source, which allows brain healing."</seg>
<seg id="850">This is what we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">"so, we decided to develop an experiment."</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to find a piece of brain mass from the non-language area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And they are then color-coloured in order to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we reimplanted it at the top of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist Transplantation - Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we reimitate these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we reimitate the same cells in the brain brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we reimplanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely, they go back home. the space is already occupied, so they will not go there, so disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we added a violation and reimplanted just the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence that they show are these small points. these are the cells that we paint in vitro in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Would these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain damage?</seg>
<seg id="865">"so, we designed monkeys with a manual depreciation task."</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feedpellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they had reached a stable squad level, we last in the motoric cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move her hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen in people, they spontaneously recovered up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover from plastifictional brain mechanisms. they can relax to some extent, just like the monkey. "</seg>
<seg id="872">"as we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left side they see the monkey, which spontaneously recovered."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original output from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not as precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now when we see the cells reimplanted, the same axis, two months after the adplantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">"I can tell you, these were also very exciting results for us."</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can use it freezing and later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example with Parkinson's."</seg>
<seg id="881">"however, our dream is still to imitate them in humans."</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope that I can show you soon, how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself."</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that is wonderful, I am sure that several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think:" I know someone who may need. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I will definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest barriers are before you can start clinical trials on humans."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest barriers are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill in about two kilograms of papers and forms, in order to go through this kind of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate etc. "</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a nearly professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried the permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes to get into hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to launch it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it needs a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, one has to apply it to a multi-centric study."</seg>
<seg id="897">"first, one must really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment each."</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: natural."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it."</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we see democracy not as the fragile plant that it is in reality, but as inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as an unchangeable relationship.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew, from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing have dubiased that it is quite possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressing growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, the democracy in us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unambiguous me that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- not to influence the austerity programs that have been realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew, or the Communist Party of China, or some of my readings to me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save us democracy but that we need a trusive and helpless democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"because without democracy our societies become one, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies is wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the topic of extravagance, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction at present our economies at present."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin-top paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"one summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the Schuldenberg, who casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the Schodenberg,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize its Gemini.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the high net of asparagus and corporations, which could be too anxious to invest there where it would be productive and income to produce all of the things that mankind is urgently needed, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past 3 months, in the United States, in England and the euro, 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars have been investing in all the prosperity of manufacturing plants, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 trillion U.S. dollar sounds after a lot of money, until one compares it with the 5,1 trillion U.S. dollars, which were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to do except the stock exchanges and the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debts and unproductive capital are the twin-tops that are not equal through the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result are stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 year olds in the US, Japan and Europe are unemployed, which, as in an end loop, support the pessimism of investors interested in which they do not invest. just as Ödipus father, who is out of fear, the prophecy of Orakels might be true that his son will kill him if he will grow,"</seg>
<seg id="925">"involuntarily, the circumstances will cause it kills him kills him."</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hatred with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"his extremely competitive art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and to especially finance the technologies," green "technologies that are decisive for saving the Earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think already. but before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the social form of society in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy of course closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to minate the significance of the athenian democracy because of these inclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision-making of the athenian democracy was and is that it was involved with the working poor and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and more important that they put them the right to political participation with the same vocal range in issues related to the state."</seg>
<seg id="935">The athenian democracy has not kept long ago --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which lights very bright, it is also quickly spread."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our present-liberal democracies have not its roots in the ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy was concentrated on the free citizens and the working poor strengthened, our liberal democracy based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for the ruling class."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and the economy is possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy - that is, the world of corporations -- a democratic-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our present democracies have been held since the point in which this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two instead of moving the economy and deprived it."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer like before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to the degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because it can be in the government nowadays and still not in power because the power of politics is abandered into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hatred with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"when you think about it, it is in about as much as a flock of carnivores which so sustainably the animals, of which they are nourished, understated that they are therefore starving."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is similar to the economy that the politics becomes so far canniised that it increases with the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of corporations increases, inequality increases, the overall economic demand falls and the general manager of the corporations are to be frightened to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism the" demos "[the people] comes from democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the wastage of human labour-power and the prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that's true, it is obvious that we have to bring together the politics and the economy and it would be better if the" Demos "control retains control, so as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is by the way no new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The teaching from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in the ancient Athens without creating new types of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to create the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers through automation and robot.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, the automation can be higher, the wastage sublime and social conflicts deeper, just as it is - very soon as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"we must therefore reforming the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and in this respect we end up in a pathological hyperautocracy that makes the film" Matrix "as a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">"so, the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements which he has produced, will survive --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is similar to a dystone, similar to the" matrix "," in which machines serve the people and people put their energy into the research of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "agora," in long talks about the meaning of life. "</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what brats it, how could it look like this" star Trek "- good utopia instead of the" matrix "-similar Dystscopy?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of companies, please make a capital market in which you deserve money while you work and in which your capital follows you from a job to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- regardless of which one is currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then, incomes from capital and redeem and the concept of wage labour is completely obsolete."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the companies, but they do not work in it, and employees who work there, but no exchange between investment and austerity, no large gaps between investment and austerity, and ultimately no emporous twin-tops."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy, please indicate that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency that is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest Emergency], in the interest of the whole of mankind."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the entire world trade is acted in this currency -- we call it" the cosmos, "in units of" Cosmos, "-- and each government pays the sum of the trade deficit or the commercial excess of the respective country, into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund is invested in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment is rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, in particular before the background of a unified policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe to you is a liberalisation, in which they preferred people, and Marxist because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the dustbin of history, and keynesiically, globally keynesiically."</seg>
<seg id="973">"but above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="974">We will awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar Dystscopy?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we live politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">"it is in our hands, and we do it better democratic."</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography even as a libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I have just said, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and the economy is... doing this not, technological development will produce a massive decline in overall economic demand that Larry Summer describes as" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"through the transfer of this crisis from a part of the earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberational democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is correct, then Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"as well as Hayek, so I am a libertarian Marxist, and as Keynes, and so I am also perfect."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: actually, and now we are too."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you do not, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers, you have said very clearly what you have from the point of view of the West to China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy to politics while the area where most of the economy is off, -- the area of economy -- an entirely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a certain sense, if I must say so provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically speaking."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what can be observed now in China, resembles very the development we had in England during the Industrial Revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"now, China is now preferable to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells huge after hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance minister in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I noticed that it comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the eurozone"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely to adopt the self-sufficiency, and the persevering denial was that a massive displacement line through the euro zone ran, and continues to massively increase the development of the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity to read on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal that revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately it is correct to do. unfortunately, the powers within the euro zone, within the European group, continues to vote the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">Yet you know what to come.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if you try to get an economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism in life, it might be delayed for a while, but when the change happens, it happens abrupt and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change their structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you have any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister, or any minister, that after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims that he made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"of course, I made mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to undersign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">"I believed that there was an honest interest in the donors, to find a common solution."</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they just wanted to bring our government to the case, just because they did not want to deal with the versioners who were walking through the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to concede that it had been a catastrophic programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"none from the Troika's troika creditors gave us this policy, and a:" that was a colossal mistake. ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive Tons of the conversations, you seem to be still quite pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the Eurozone did not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if they did not survive, the uncoverings will be demonic and the European Union will destroy."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not be disastrous for Europe, but for the whole world economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the most powerful economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"if we allow ourselves to hit the path of post-modern 1930, according to what it appears to me, it will be equally unbearable for the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans."</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong in that point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">"Yanis, thank you for having been with TED."</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thanks.</seg>
<seg id="1038">"Roy Price never heard most of them, although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">"Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios,"</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a spooky and describes Twitter as" movies, TV, technology, tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for providing the shows and content to produce Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard hit industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy cannot choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows that are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are on the right of this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the applicants distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows you get this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"will your show be rated with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" "Breaking Bad", "" "The Wire" "-- all the shows, who are addicted where, after having asked a season to ask your brain:" "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left hand side, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at that end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not need to get into the left side of the curve, because I think it needs special intelligence to accommodate" "Toddlers and Tiaras". ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the average endurance, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they just inspire not."</seg>
<seg id="1057">"so, he must make sure that he really is on the right side."</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes such a thing, so Roy Price does not want to risk."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he keeps a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses by an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and sets them online where everyone can watch them for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and when Amazon is out there for nothing, it is right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators have a look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are observed at the watch of these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who take up everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you capture when to start the show, when you look at, which parts you are skipped or again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">"they collect millions of data to decide with this data, which show you should produce."</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process these and this results in response, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom about four Republican US senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- hence something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"about at the same time with another company, another manager has placed a top-show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming design of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super-show and he also uses data for it, but he does it a little different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of holding a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data on Netflix viewers, so the reviews that they give the shows, their course, what shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use these data to find out these little details about the spectators, which shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they entered a venture and decided not to make a Sitcom about four senators but a drama series on a Senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," "House of Cards". "Netflix has borrowed a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets an 9,1 rating on this curve. thus, exactly where they wanted to go. "</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"it has two very competitive, data sealed firms."</seg>
<seg id="1082">They combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow means that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data for a decision you meet, then you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">One has 200 years at statistics as Back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">One optimized it thanks to very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the least thing you can expect is good TV, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis is not working, then this is something terrifying because we live in a time in which we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"nobody. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody in this room ever comes in touch with this software. come in touch with it you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if any one is here in the US in prison and ask for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is made or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of choosing whether a show will be good or bad, a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"television, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">"this is not always the best results, it is not that a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data."</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of the most reputable companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"Google announced that it can predict through data analysis outbreaks of flu, the worse way, can predict -- by data analysis of the Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderful and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked perfectly, year round year, until it suddenly did not work,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it was simply not working, it was once again a sensation, including the withdrawal of the publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even data sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data stream into decisions of life - at work, at the workplace, in case of law, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">"so, we prefer to ensure that data is helpful."</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-assisted genetics -- an area, where some very clever people are unimaginable to use many data to make serious decisions about how to make decisions for cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have identified some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"you define this problem in its parts, so you can analyse the items; as a set, you set up the parts again to write a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times but there are always two things to take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help you to disintegrate a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to put together the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">"for this, there is another tool and we all have it: our brain."</seg>
<seg id="1117">"when there is something that's good in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces to put together again, even if the information is incomplete in order to then hold a good decision - especially when it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"that's why I think it was Netflix so successful because they have used data and minds, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use the data to better understand their audience, which otherwise they would not have been able to put together, but the decision on how to put all these parts again and make it a show like" House of Cards "does not stand in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon on the other hand did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first when they chose TV ideas, then when they elected" Alpha House "as the show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say: "we tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe that things go wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful them are, data are just a tool and not to forget that, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the tool for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" magic 8 ball ". it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer." most likely, "right here at that moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will return it later with a technique-demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far I met some decisions in my life, whereby I should listen to the ball in the afternoon."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"however, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace them through something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"however, this does not change the basic structure."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"maybe the ball is wiser and clever, and wiser. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right corner."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as very encouraging news that in spite of the large amount of data still pays off, decisions to meet, an expert in what you do, and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"for in the end there is not the data, but the risks, with which you end up at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks nice.</seg>
