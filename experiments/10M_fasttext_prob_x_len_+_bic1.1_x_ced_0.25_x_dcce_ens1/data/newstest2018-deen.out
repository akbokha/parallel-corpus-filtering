Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that make your view of the city
&quot; an Irish @-@ institution , where young people are to meet today . &quot;
a tomb kap@@ elle where is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
gar@@ den@@ ers cultiv@@ ate the one @-@ time ground of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it nerve if maps are not up to date .
&quot; that knows everyone , who had to make yourself exciting , because the auto @-@ Nav@@ i took place a green meadow instead of a walk @-@ up street . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as of Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but current - but it is therefore very revealing . &quot;
especially when you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mercury since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ chwork carpet that can be seen as such .
&quot; for cities and communities have been introduced for more detailed maps , such as pri@@ ming sheets . &quot;
these ar@@ isen according to the data of the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ tics administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and in the first Ver@@ messung Bavaria .
your Customer : Napoleon .
the French chair@@ men occupied Bavaria since the spring 1800 during the Second Ko@@ ali@@ fe War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic recording of Bay@@ erns - of course for military purposes .
&quot; although French troops ended with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 , it was today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nation@@ wide Bavaria map . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max I@@ V. Joseph driving forward the project and founded the &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Mechan@@ ical Management . &quot;
the prototype sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like any other to find on the website of the Bay@@ erische Staats@@ bibliothek .
the comparison morning / Today is the most impressive state of the state capital .
the city has spread over all directions and has grown together .
one example of this is sub@@ s@@ end@@ ling that appears in the map of 18@@ 56 still relatively isolated .
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the map , thus 1877 , as a Munich city district . &quot;
today it is located in the middle of the city .
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ s@@ end@@ ings are concentrated in 18@@ 56 along the current Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the uprising of the Bav@@ arian peasants against Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West park is , there is nothing but a fields - at the first glance : in the Hin@@ ein@@ zo@@ oma it appears a smaller and smaller card with un@@ used lines and numbers : hand@@ written fl@@ ur@@ ks from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; urine recording &quot; &quot; from which the basic tax was derived . &quot;
&quot; small par@@ c@@ els do not go there for farmers more - but also the gar@@ dener of the plant &quot; &quot; land in Sun . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ s@@ end@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 venue of the October fes@@ ts , was in fact a meadow - and not concrete . &quot;
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the field of the district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen reads not only the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or of the height &quot; On the air &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ fel@@ d@@ straße one once met people with mani@@ fold problems . &quot;
there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich district of the Ir@@ ren@@ aissance in 18@@ 58 / 59 .
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard of Gu@@ dden led the establishment of a psychiat@@ r@@ ist who is associated with the death of King Ludwi@@ gs II . &quot;
&quot; he was progres@@ sively for his time and ended , for example the accus@@ ation of so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he is forbidden to apply the staff to apply violence against the passengers , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has engaged in an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients had been first place , later on 500 seats were extended . &quot;
&quot; sometime , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the rot@@ ary pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary in hair 1905 . &quot;
&quot; there is the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ East since 2006 , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ry . &quot;
on the area of former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt now people encounter young people in the Munich Sal@@ esians .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and changed it into a youth home with training .
&quot; to the west is the football ground of the TS@@ V Munich east , east of the cottages from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 we set up the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; &quot; - in ar@@ quit@@ ecture to the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ aissance , which was destroyed during World War II in bombar@@ d@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was named after 18@@ 56 as the &quot; &quot; Head Square &quot; , &quot; the name of the department name was &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought to the Second World War in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Al@@ lies were in the city of December 1944 many holes in the city center .
a large one remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business buildings and a tomb of the Middle Ages was once at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where this day will take the pre @-@ work and on 5 April 2017 of the so@@ d for the second S @-@ Bahn line . &quot;
&quot; with the sli@@ der , the old Munich @-@ card can be compared with the a@@ erial view of today - and the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof . &quot;
civil rights @-@ group published travel @-@ warning for Missouri
the National Association of promoting Far@@ ming has issued a warning for color people who are travelling to Missouri because of the discrimin@@ atory politics and the rac@@ ist attacks of the state to Missouri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Board for the State of Missouri , who will enter into force by the State until 28 August 2017 , as a series of questionable , race @-@ based incident can occur at the last time throughout the country and here , it is stated in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Missouri , which makes people harder to win discrimination , as well as the pro@@ secution of the state , which resulted in disproportion@@ ate minorities , prompted the group to put out the journey , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
&quot; they have wounds of civil rights , people happen . &quot;
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are cr@@ ushed or killed , &quot; &quot; said the president of the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
&quot; we hear discomfort in such a frequency , which we have not heard yet . &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US .
&quot; the group quoted incidents like rac@@ ist promises against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year , after having no gasoline anymore during the journey and taken by the police of Missouri in custody without a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the General Council of Missouri , where it is shown that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and employees inform about what might happen in Missouri , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people have to be willing to bring about whether they bring us money or their relatives know that they are travelling through the state .
&quot; Missouri in 2015 , 2014 was signed up to 100 meetings , according to the latest figures from the real @-@ hate reference program of the F@@ BI , which steps the state with regard to the number of such injury to the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
&quot; the travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law , which would make it harder to reduce a company because of living or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had published travel warnings for Texas and Arizona since the states had approved immigration legislation to commit people because of mig@@ rates to further pension profile . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but in recent times stakeholders have used the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
Wei@@ ghing Project is elementary
the fisher@@ y Wei@@ de@@ jo@@ t Project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U bund@@ les Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have released a picture on site .
&quot; during the village of Sch@@ wen@@ dem@@ ann , representatives of the fishing village of K@@ wen@@ dem@@ ann met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two representatives . &quot;
&quot; Markus Sch@@ wen@@ dem@@ ann finally granted insights into its operation , in which he houses 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of Woods , 40 Mil@@ ca@@ h and also many kittens , and in five apartments . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; black milk &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative mar@@ ke@@ less mark@@ eter for the milk of his cows , so swi@@ vel@@ ing . &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ste comes exclusively regional .
&quot; since he is also the BL@@ H@@ V chair of Fisch@@ bach , he called the Wei@@ ghing project as a &quot; elementary project . &quot; &quot;
I can not manage on such steep surfaces .
&quot; the green space for a lot of work , much would have to be processed with the motor @-@ sense . &quot;
&quot; we have here with the conditions and the top@@ ography , &quot; stressed Sch@@ wen@@ dem@@ ann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the el@@ ter@@ al operation and delivered these without chemical plant protection and fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers , even if it is not a bio@@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognised the significance of the hamlet , and is glad to promote the leader . &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per h@@ ect@@ are the farmers had to be supported .
I hope that the aff@@ or@@ est@@ ations of the areas might still be pulled out for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have , are the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts of how they carry on their farm , &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot;
farmers are often standing in criticism due to the promotion
more than 25 plots were enclosed in 2013 by eleven participants in 2013 .
the Dis@@ closure surface is about 40 hectares which may not be un@@ explored until at least 20@@ 23 .
&quot; of the total cost of 71 500 euro was funded half by Leader , a quarter performed by the municipality of fishermen . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers remaining 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the longevity of fences , &quot; stated Sch@@ wen@@ dem@@ ann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and land , it isn &apos;t . &quot;
also for Peter White stood firm : &quot; here the best food is produced . &quot;
the coalition @-@ shre@@ dding ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg to the state promotion of pasture @-@ fences .
the aim is to open the Black Forest .
pre@@ condition is the presence of one of the L@@ PR @-@ signed conveyor belts .
&quot; in addition , the fenced area may not be tow@@ ed ( Hang@@ ing over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by aff@@ or@@ est@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; for the fishing village in 2018 , by 2018 we are currently using eight participants with 24 plots who want to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence . &quot;
&quot; the surface area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp takes the Statue of Liberty
the safest sign of a regime change is it when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate these equally like any other - hence the down@@ stream overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Bagh@@ dad in the year 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp @-@ regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic A@@ xt with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N about the proposals of the President for the dramatic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ im@@ it@@ ators would have borrowed him if he had done it .
&quot; but he grab@@ bed their meaning and especially the meaning that you have been attributed to , when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to his base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta : &quot; &quot; I do not want to go down here to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot;
the poem which you relate to be added later and not part of the original statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is true of fac@@ tu@@ ally right , but as he form@@ ulate it itself , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary response to the touching words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; &quot; your tired , your poor , / your crow@@ ding masses that are longing to breathe freely , / the el@@ ending waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; miserable waste &quot; was better seen on our screens .
Miller has not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural engagement : it is indeed a conflict about the significance of America .
Lazarus - and their friends who sat down to place their words after their death at the base - knew very good that they have done a high @-@ political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American republi@@ can by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in an inten@@ tional classic depic@@ tion of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract -- it has a voice .
and she himself gives herself a very different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist Cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vism .
&quot; and exactly how Lazarus changed the importance of the statue , the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great cry for rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was anyone asking anyone , but rather an early neo@@ conserv@@ atives , who bring the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; &quot; Lady Liberty goes forward . &quot;
it is intended to wear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch is not supposed to en@@ ligh@@ ten the way to the United States .
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on a little razor .
the importance of the statue is entirely a question of the perception of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative effect of Lazarus was in the fact that they see , as they were seen by the creators , miserable , but hope@@ ful people after long and often terrible trips on the Dec@@ ks of ships . &quot;
&quot; it is in the true sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and find a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .
and of course this is not the perspective that Miller &apos;s Miller and Tru@@ mp would ever wish to acknowledge .
&quot; their tor@@ ch is not supposed to en@@ ligh@@ ten their way , but the hate who is their only source of power . &quot;
world championship 2017 : Neil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle is reminded of a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; the performance director of the Athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member cont@@ ingent cont@@ ingent of the World Championships will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 that starts on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland is developing something special &quot; and the Athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it .
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy at the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals @-@ candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m circuit , while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle &apos;s team has been chosen for team capacity . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ dh is quite modest , &quot;
&quot; her captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or exercising , they went out of the room and felt very proud and were highly motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and real feeling that E@@ ili@@ dh very naturally introduced , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Commonwealth @-@ Silver Medal , which is in her fifth world champi@@ on@@ ships with the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it &apos;s &quot; unbelievable &quot; is that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven who were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ range Mu@@ ir lead on this path and last year has established five British and two European records .
&quot; they will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runners . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m running , is another Scot@@ sman that one should observe after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle is reminded of their first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
&quot; the team leaders says that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots would not only belong to the team , but in some cases with the medals and the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; what is special about team captain , it is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that anyway it was a great honour , but knowing that my team mates have voted for me and chosen me , makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on Po@@ dien . &quot;
what are my speech as captain ?
&quot; yes , I think it went well . &quot;
&quot; I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home world championship . &quot;
&quot; so , it is really important to put on this home backup and benefit from that we are back at the Olympiastadion . &quot;
I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there .
blocking cri@@ tic about Facebook : do not take you to a public office if you cannot toler@@ ate the income of elec@@ torate .
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers beat him because of the internal policy to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he sli@@ pped in the cri@@ tique , for sure . &quot;
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 Washington said , Washington : &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , dum@@ b and dum@@ b we will run as sheep for battles . &quot;
this brings me to Maryland to governor Larry H@@ og@@ an who needs to work more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and er@@ ased their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union gave him the conclusion of this week at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the rod of the Gover@@ nor left the law@@ suit as fri@@ vo@@ l , and the online comment was full of a reaction @-@ reaction with &quot; Well , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important when it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; this is a Republican Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is surprisingly popular . &quot;
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to deb@@ ated his ha@@ ke@@ less head to chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; hence , the block@@ age of individuals who come to the Gover@@ nor side - which is a public forum that is officially referred to as officially and by employees working with public tax dollars - need@@ less and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans entered into Amel@@ ia Ch@@ asse the actions of the Gover@@ nor and argued that the block@@ age of the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; but it is too easy to use the picture of tro@@ lling or sp@@ ammers , or hate people who swing online the whi@@ p . &quot;
the post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entre@@ preneur , and a pastor , not a tro@@ lls . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful , and not profound . &quot;
the pastor gave the Bible in his post and appeals to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic Faith .
&quot; attor@@ ney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ asser@@ ted , but she asked for hate relationship . &quot;
&quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate relationship and other current news , &quot; &quot; wrote them in the commentary box of the message &quot; &quot; The Post &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people take place in the same topic , then they become dis@@ regarded by some rather than so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the employees of the Gover@@ nor were &quot; &quot; concentrated &quot; &quot; spam attack &quot; , &quot; others would probably call &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocked a cri@@ tic or a negative comment . &quot;
&quot; it is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical lad@@ les , to burn and burn demonstr@@ ators and silence . &quot;
but exactly this is happening digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials who is cri@@ tici@@ zed on Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is accused of Twitter users that were blocked from his Twitter feed .
one of the first milestones in this question came to Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Supervis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County was last the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to the U.@@ S.@@ C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they proclaimed a vot@@ er from their Facebook page . &quot;
and in K@@ entu@@ cky was governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit to AC@@ L@@ U because of its use on Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so hard .
&quot; at present , Washington had a similar effect at the time of affordable port@@ tos , such as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous let@@ ter@@ ers hit his leadership . &quot;
and even at that time Washington had an anonymous tro@@ lls .
&quot; the people who use pseu@@ don@@ y@@ me such as Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers , the Washington &apos;s decision . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions , who critic@@ ised his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping on the UK , was overwhelmed by the historical documents issued by the George Washington Project . &quot;
but he has not sil@@ enced it to silence .
&quot; free speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means that to accept .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former European Union No 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort in the next three days , since the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ di@@ re , who was in the last year next door in the Ar@@ cher@@ field links up to the final race , before he was bound up against Paul E@@ ales , and acts as tournament leaders in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he reaches his glory with this event , &quot; said raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great state . &quot;
Jerry has made a great job when he set this place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous suppor@@ ter of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the English E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , even though he won the European tour in his 32 @-@ year career as well as at the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; this really feels particularly &quot; , &quot; said the player in South@@ port housed players . &quot;
&quot; I have not able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open , because it was in the year after I have won them from the program . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories from the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we always appreciated .
Gary OR@@ R who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday before returning to the European Senior Tour .
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a little bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; said OR@@ R , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot;
&quot; I really enjoyed it again , and I played a solid golf . &quot;
I am happy as far as I had gone .
&quot; with the Trio on the field , the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ames . &quot;
&quot; OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup winner Sam Tor@@ rance belongs to the six skins on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ All@@ ister , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dru@@ m@@ mond . &quot;
the entrance is free of charge : the parking costs £ 5 per car with a passengers and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers .
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by pas@@ si@@ smoke
over the past two decades less people have died in a lung cancer for over the past two decades .
this result is the result of scientists from the University Hospital of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , a year 16@@ 7 pul@@ l@@ ings of pas@@ si@@ ders are due to pas@@ si@@ smoke &quot; , &quot; said director Hei@@ ko mu@@ gs . &quot;
as a comparison he moved his own study on this subject from 1994 .
at that time there have been 400 lung cancer due to pas@@ v@@ rau@@ matic per year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
pets are regarded as very complex
&quot; the construction work in Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; &quot; lies halfway in time , &quot; &quot; says the head of the farm Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of house inclu@@ sions , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is much to be seen in the sub@@ strate , which is not in the plans . &quot;
&quot; the traffic , which again and again the construction work disabled , represents a major problem for the B@@ aut@@ rupp of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of the drivers in front of red lights and lock@@ ers is enormous , &quot; &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is closed and only the buses are entitled to drive .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been busy since weeks with working on the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the hot days were pretty ti@@ ring .
&quot; but luckily we were provided by our friend Fritz Matt with a bold mineral water , &quot; &quot; tells Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in Indonesian Gold@@ land
&quot; when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i bo@@ il the dinner , they do not use a stove . &quot;
they even use rarely a pot .
&quot; in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai River in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province Papua , the house@@ wife usually places a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - right in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour the ch@@ opped Kn@@ ol@@ le will be taken away with e@@ ager@@ ly , un@@ washed hands and dev@@ oured . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the arm@@ chair - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , for example clothes with dec@@ ep@@ tive water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bu@@ cket in a homeless space is used as lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her husband were not assigned to their fields . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , late to work can be dangerous : most vill@@ us are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es it , after 5 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony that was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elder should vote against the occupying troops before the occupying forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which touched for independence against the Dutch rule , turned rapidly against the government of Jak@@ arta who has control over the region and foreign journalists or legal notice . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Papua and West Papua , with the independent part Papua New Guinea @-@ Neu@@ gu@@ ine@@ as occupied the eastern part of the island . &quot;
&quot; En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is br@@ ittle , the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car . &quot;
there are no public transportation .
&quot; the city with approximately 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is composed of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ boo fences , and from cor@@ ru@@ gated boards , which were converted by r@@ ust in various yellow @-@ brown tones . &quot;
&quot; very few Indonesian have made their journey here , because journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans did a God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not accu@@ stom@@ ed to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to their vivid , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , you dark shirts and their bright rock . &quot;
&quot; earlier , we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poorest province where 28 % of the people living under the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ancy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesian Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an , is located only 60 miles away from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ lands in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , Free@@ port was built in 2015 alone in the value of 3.2 billion US dollars and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Papua with timber resources in the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; however , these riches are a source of misery for the Papua , ensuring that Indonesia &apos;s strong military maintains an er@@ sti@@ cky presence . &quot;
&quot; an inquiry from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port local military units and units paid between 1998 and 2004 nearly 20 million US dollars , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ sian demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these Golden G@@ ans and are treated mer@@ cil@@ ess .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 residents have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed by the Indonesian military since 1969 . &quot;
massage positions in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal land in the 1970 @-@ 18 years have been forced to commit genocide .
&quot; alone in the region , the Indonesian police were more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; we value the &quot; &quot; All &quot; &quot; in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Brisbane from the year 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities and torture - rape and electric stops are popular after another report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as each week has occurred , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; bol@@ ts have ampli@@ fied , since Pap@@ u@@ as resources have a influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is about 83 % Christian , but demo@@ graphic development is changing as the Muslim economy of the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sumatra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ung @-@ Kant@@ ins sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ ar sauce . &quot;
local people fight for taking part here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local Papua , A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year Pan@@ i@@ ai District , who went to work in the province of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has cost the native Papua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; from Papua , to their market . &quot;
&quot; the Indonesian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the vern@@ acular and as Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke to the ine@@ qualities and the legal injury to Papua during his election campaign . &quot;
the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Papua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 a group of 11 children was out there and sang Christmas car@@ ols before a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke on a motorcycle by the darkness . &quot;
the fri@@ ghtened children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took the impetus at their sound , and later came back with four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , and struck the group with their guns , spoke of victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired in the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , became so hard hit that he fell into coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby governmental commission set on fire and the things escal@@ ate on the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered together on a football ground in front of the local police station and the Military Commander centre to ask for justice . &quot;
they carried out ceremonial hunting @-@ bows and led the orph@@ ita dance - in the circle constantly and a bird @-@ singing - of Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some protesters began to boun@@ ce stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers was sent a command over an internal funk : &quot; &quot; if the masses were able to afford more than three times , they shoot her dead , &quot; &quot; says it in an official document of T@@ IME that has not been released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ pping danger and called for peace and called the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned , I suddenly turned into my lin@@ kes wr@@ ist , he said T@@ IME on the porch of his colourful wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still does not know who has fired , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the soldiers assembled . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w has been hit three times , his cousin , the witness of the sho@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and instruc@@ ted his body to make sure that he was , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indonesian only bear a name , the T@@ IME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the head @-@ spec@@ tor of Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , re@@ porters said his officers would only secure their station , because they are being attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people dro@@ us to kill us , &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings came at the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; after Jak@@ arta .
three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in which he has expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua .
&quot; I would like this case to be resolved right away so that there will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; security ministers Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 , that he set up an extra@@ judicial mechanism of human rights ab@@ uses in October 2016 . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries are performed a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these off@@ ences , but there are processes that must go through &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke to T@@ IME on June 5th , and said , he did not set any plans to set up a complaint mechanism . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wir@@ anto , which the UN has accused of crimes against humanity , said more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence vote in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been resolved in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai pron@@ unci@@ ation . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims were contrary to such claims with fierce dis@@ belief .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he was still living in fear later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , have fear , shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
&quot; he says that he was struck by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims . &quot;
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought after me , &quot; says he . &quot;
the sho@@ ots have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighbourhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; while a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a building company that refused to bring a mind @-@ less man to hospital , died a person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus dou@@ w , who was drunk when he was in a nearby river fisher@@ y , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
activated vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers gave stones to officers who responded to it by blocking war@@ es .
but natives say that the mobile brig@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i who has been living near the hospital and witness how the wounded has been delivered here quickly , so the T@@ IME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament calls to educate the officers involved and withdraw the mobile brig@@ ade of the police from the region .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an im@@ pover@@ ishment for the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development reinfor@@ ces the dis@@ satisfaction of the tribal leaders , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papua by encounter@@ ing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of ind@@ on@@ ese soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to recent years thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitrary in custody , under the pretext of securing the national sovereignty . &quot;
some will never dive again .
&quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , for@@ got@@ hic place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction .
rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just out of reach .
the people here build everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women to edit four or five fields of Sweet potato .
keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian Rup@@ ia ( 75 C@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the local Papua and the new migrants are grown , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire . &quot;
the few jobs that there are in the region usually go to the better educated and aff@@ lu@@ ent migrants .
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own companies competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John G@@ ob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions of reporting international media remain tense . &quot;
at the beginning of the year the French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Basi@@ lle Long@@ cham@@ p had been de@@ ported by lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua although the rare permission to the films were given .
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is electoral campaign , the restrictions of reporting , to increase transparency and development , are not realised . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia un@@ quiet east@@ ernmost provinces of Papua and West pap@@ ua . visa ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; for the lack of press control , the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in March six p@@ acific states - Tong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically been supported by the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r pointed out the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights . &quot;
people on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the Pap@@ ers Messenger Ke@@ es Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited her silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source which also participated in the session but remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has got another presidential election , but the Papua to say that it probably does not vote again for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , says G@@ ob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal Council . &quot;
&quot; he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , aside from it , that it is under the constant threat of a mountainous military , is based in poor education and health services . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , can look at their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; debt &quot; which he has to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and intimid@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ uss@@ ar led an last symbolic act of the plo@@ dding : the body of a victim was buried in an area just across the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they may never enter justice , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with his head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scrap@@ ers of Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire found on Friday in one of the highest towers of the world in Dubai its thorou@@ gh@@ tier and forced hundreds of residents , from the 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ storey building to flee . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that is known in just two years by the Hoch@@ haus , which is accidentally known the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) . &quot;
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated and injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; we slept here and we are standing at the fire of fire , and when they came up with the cry of the people . &quot;
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor to the bottom , &quot; told a resident who had his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Du@@ b@@ ais civilian protection authorities said that the units of fire fight against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 hrs GMT ) the fire ext@@ ingu@@ ished and the building co@@ ols .
the government said they work in providing accommodation for those affected .
&quot; the incident can cause questions about the safety of materials used in foreign areas of sky@@ scrap@@ ers , all over the world . &quot;
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch @-@ building after its fire in 2015 yiel@@ ded that most of the damages caused by the fair@@ ing , exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and fair@@ ing in the London gr@@ ace@@ ful Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of an area in June , with which approximately 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis @-@ Cup reform : more Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis Con@@ federation ( IT@@ F ) was completed with his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the session in Ho Chi Minh City , he was supported for this sport @-@ revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single on two numbers , hau@@ led and not supported by the required two @-@ third majority . &quot;
&quot; indeed very long , but also therefore very cher@@ ished five @-@ set @-@ classics remain the traditional competition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 per cent of member states voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F @-@ President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was not only missing . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our general nations did not have the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this iconic and historic cont@@ ests , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
one will continue to be working to improve the rate .
&quot; not only for the vote was after a lot of inspiration , the proposal came to a neutral place . &quot;
new from 2018 are just a comparatively small details : so the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host for the first round in the first round .
&quot; to reduce the cost of the organizer , the requirements are facilit@@ ated in terms of training stations , etc. and players will need to be completed less official media appointments in front of the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 of 5 US travelers will bring more bot@@ hered objects into the plane , finds a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by plane @-@ passengers found that more than 20 percent are aware or un@@ consciously transmitted objects to the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration to smug@@ gle , including at least 6 per cent that wor@@ shipped the aircraft while accidentally wor@@ shipped bot@@ hered kni@@ ves or other items with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 per cent claimed that they could have delayed that they were ab@@ err@@ atic with bul@@ lets , amm@@ unition , or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey conducted with more than 1,000 people - that was carried out by a Jet @-@ Charter@@ service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers should pay attention to the rules . &quot;
&quot; the respon@@ dents said that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned from the T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent Mill@@ ennial , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were . &quot;
the most common items that were circul@@ ated to T@@ SA agents were gro@@ unded foods and liquids .
&quot; more than 3 percent were required to know@@ ingly have borne items with blades by the safety control , while 2.@@ 2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they could have inten@@ tionally inf@@ lic@@ ted drugs into the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; the company said I was wondering in all the country to find out how many acci@@ dental smug@@ glers could have done through the aircraft security , and how many things could have done . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that the people who wear smug@@ gling goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry the safety , those that are most often flying . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA rules are somewhat complicated and confusing . &quot;
the people are often uncertain what liquids may take them or how much of it .
&quot; so , there is no surprise that the greatest amount of goods conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA conf@@ is@@ cated items . &quot;
for a time the people thought the T@@ SA could see books as smug@@ gling goods .
&quot; liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter of tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers
&quot; electro @-@ thous@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k , with the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in the process , he has under@@ gone so far that some of the clients have withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the continually tri@@ p@@ ies figures for sales and even a gigantic sales target , Tes@@ la @-@ Chief El@@ on Mus@@ k at the announcement of the recent quar@@ terly survey has revealed for the first time a different , less smooth number : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; during the last few months , Mus@@ k often applied for the new car over the past few months , its delivery straight begins . &quot;
&quot; now Mus@@ k is a : of the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ ordered , 6@@ 3,000 has been withdrawn again . &quot;
critics have always pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; during a cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot;
&quot; currently , 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations are present in a telephone conference with an@@ alysts . &quot;
&quot; that the cancellation of so far about twelve per cent of all orders could be considered , the Tes@@ la chef does not believe . &quot;
&quot; its argument : the challenge of ambitious growth aims is not in demand , but on the production site . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la supplied 8@@ 4.000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; by 2018 it will be possible - all models - 500@@ .000 , 2020 , one million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k there are currently 1800 reservations per day .
&quot; who today orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; , &quot; at the earliest to count on the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand new , never in practice tested production lines without larger inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum util@@ isation . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; however , it comes to major delays , then the binding ability of reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company can not prevent dis@@ satisfied customers in disgu@@ ises . &quot;
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt moves back to reduce emissions from the Obama &apos;s policy to reduce emissions
&quot; one day after having been rejected by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the leader of the environmental protection authority , had to delay his previous decision to implement the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g poll@@ ut@@ ants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities towards urgent faster than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit which had been raised against his previous place in a federal court .
&quot; it is about a deadline , running on 1 October for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for floor @-@ level o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; he announced in June that he will delay the compliance with a year to study the plan of his authority , to study the plan and to avoid any economic growth in local decisions . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was founded in front of his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp Pro@@ secutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was long time a reliable opponent of environmental protection regulations . &quot;
&quot; since his arrival in Washington P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly been repeated , blocking or delay , to dis@@ connect the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden conversion from Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the sequ@@ el regul@@ atory agenda .
&quot; last month , a federal court in Washington has decided that the EPA Commission has exceeded his authority as he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas company for monitoring and reduction of methane . &quot;
&quot; in one on the Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt present , that its about @-@ turn in o@@ zone standards is simply the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely meeting of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA often asked the dead@@ lines to carry out and then were accused of being indic@@ ted by active groups and others , and in an agreement concluded the appointment for the performance , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by jurisdiction , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also take the law and authority which it gives us , seriously . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the statement of EPA said that P@@ ru@@ v@@ itt eventually exp@@ ire his &quot; authority to delay and all others legally available &quot; , &quot; to ensure that the regulations are based on a sound policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Re@@ public@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a broader ren@@ unci@@ ation of o@@ zone rules .
one last month approved law@@ suit was intended to delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 by at least eight years .
the measure has not yet been set up in the Senate .
&quot; the New York Secretary @-@ General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of the States who had accused the EPA during this week , said , the group intend to maintain the statutory pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our pl@@ agues - is an important asset for the health and safety of these 6,@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans affected directly from the Smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; said tail@@ oring . &quot;
&quot; in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ias , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;
&quot; soil o@@ zone origin@@ ates if poll@@ ut@@ ants are made from cars , power stations , oil @-@ fin@@ eries , chem@@ ists and other sources in the atmosphere of sunlight . &quot;
&quot; the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems , and each year contribute to thousands of premature death cases . &quot;
representatives of the public health area and the environ@@ ment@@ alists were rejo@@ iced about P@@ ru@@ dence of surprising courses .
&quot; it is dist@@ ressing how much pressure it needs to get this reasonable step of those responsible for the protection of air we inhal@@ e , &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot;
we need to continue fighting against the ideological Crus@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government to absorb the pollution and their particular interests .
Tum@@ lingen are celebrating 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche Church , on the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16 July , at 4.@@ 30 p.m. to a Seren@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility , a popular place to stay . &quot;
the visitors of the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z @-@ Seren@@ ade can be enchanted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors of turmo@@ il to their concerns .
Walter Martin@@ i stresses : &quot; it is a unique village of village .
&quot; in the year 12@@ 67 , St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was mentioned for the first time in the Wur@@ z@@ gic premi@@ ère @-@ book , &quot; Count Hermann von Sul@@ z , &quot; with the parish church on Tum@@ ski , and his brother Diet@@ rich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the wording of the document , on the Tum@@ linger Berg , besides the former parish church , there was also a glori@@ ous court which belonged to the church or the patron law and not the other way around . &quot;
there are also people living there .
&quot; as seen from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , in addition to the sub@@ village and the Ober@@ dorf , today the &quot; &quot; Mountain &quot; , &quot; is the &quot; &quot; mountain &quot; &quot; of the third , the grand family @-@ core of the village . &quot;
old maps from the time around the year 1600 under@@ lines this historical circumstances .
the Pat@@ ron@@ ate was created from the earliest medieval self @-@ law law .
&quot; a Lord , who built a church , occupied and occupied with a priest , remained an owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this own church . &quot;
&quot; thus , the right to use a pastor or to propose a new pastor . &quot;
three alt@@ ars existed in the church and two bells on the tower .
the biggest of the two breaks to Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell dates back to the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed out later during World War II in 1942 . &quot;
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were pushed and the bell @-@ parts were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops and French troops in the vicinity of the church .
&quot; they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs , and used them as fire@@ wood . &quot;
remains of the church threatened in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 1869 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery was also used as the last resting place for the dead from audi@@ tors . &quot;
18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ Church had been demol@@ ished .
only the church tower left .
in the Neu@@ jahr@@ sn@@ eight 18@@ 34 a storm obsol@@ ete the church tower and half st@@ amping .
&quot; to prevent disaster , the tower was can@@ cel@@ ed . &quot;
only the present turmo@@ il still remained as a witness to the 750 year old church history .
&quot; today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ as@@ em , from the &quot; creation pen@@ sion@@ ers &quot; as the successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn , the Hil@@ arius attachment . &quot;
&quot; as an organizer invite the friends and sponsors of turmo@@ il on Sunday , 16 July , to the sixth seren@@ ade on the old cemetery of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
it is designed by the Com@@ bo of Ke@@ pler &apos;s Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with words by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ te@@ is .
place Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the closing word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 o &apos;clock .
entry is available from 15.@@ 30 pm .
&quot; for the end of the seren@@ ade , there is a trunk in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with the wide view over meadows , to the forest , &quot; the organis@@ ers place the fantastic view . &quot;
the seren@@ ade can only take place on dry weather .
&quot; the organis@@ ers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historical St. Hil@@ arius system , which is of importance for tum@@ our and listening . &quot;
&quot; the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ ens feel particularly committed to the home care , such as the Seren@@ ade organizer Walter Martin@@ i . &quot;
society wants to let the approval of wind @-@ wheels
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; does not see any legal requirements for construction and therefore has turned towards the coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; has called Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to increase its approval for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
&quot; the association argue that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved since at the time in Vier@@ sen merely on the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal , there is a wind force concentration . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city . &quot;
the zones should prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of landscape .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had a second wind power station in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , which was not approved by a change in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but the district government was not approved in Düsseldorf , because of a formal mistake . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of plan@@ ation , the per@@ mitting authorization is illegal and therefore illegal , &quot; &quot; said Christopher Hei@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : the Stad@@ lan@@ tern has once again decided the wind @-@ concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a permit from the District Government is still under construction .
&quot; at this point , the division of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines are legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the challenge .
&quot; the appropriate writing has been received since last week at the district of Vier@@ sen , &quot; &quot; declared a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes her to the occasion to check the matter again .
&quot; however , you do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; looking forward to ongoing proceedings at the Board of Directors , the circle in Thursday wanted not to express their contents in terms of the argum@@ entation of the &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , the construction of four hundred metres high wind@@ wheels . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , the company had participated in which the city of Vier@@ sen was taken over , p@@ ei@@ ties with the owner of approximately 65 hectares of large terrain . &quot;
&quot; with the establishment of four wind turbines , the power demand of around 11 400 households is to be covered - this corresponds to approximately one in the electricity of all quad@@ rup@@ ters . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros .
&quot; during the last summer , Vier@@ sens City went green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at Wind@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind turbines in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Hein@@ sberg district . &quot;
car and tractor cr@@ ashing together : woman dies in an aw@@ ful accident
one dre@@ ad@@ ful traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ district ) .
a woman was wounded .
two more people were easily injured .
the provincial road remained closed over hours .
after police information a 17 @-@ year young woman made from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her car in the frame of the accompanying driver with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as an esc@@ ort the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel .
city and dealers plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ z@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping facilities in the city center in September .
&quot; the Gewer@@ bever@@ ein and the city administration would like to take advantage of the weekend on 8 and 9 September , to attract the inhabitants to shopping in the city center . &quot;
&quot; as the president of the Gewer@@ bever@@ ein , Christian König , announced the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; weekends the customers want to raise awareness of what offers the own city away from the usual supermarket merchandise . &quot;
&quot; the market is planned for a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , domestic companies have to present themselves with their educational institutions . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre should invite you to &quot; Mit@@ ter@@ night shopping . &quot; &quot;
the action is not just for residents of the city and the nearby region .
&quot; in preparation are commerci@@ als in the radio , an internet video and printed bags that indicate on the weekend @-@ weekend , says Christian king . &quot;
Municip@@ ality and Gewer@@ bever@@ ein co @-@ operate with the Chamber of Commerce and Commerce .
&quot; thus , the commercial ren@@ ditions are entering a further stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these include new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; Ak@@ tiv Day &quot; &quot; to the well @-@ being and sold @-@ up Sunday , conversations with all tra@@ des@@ men and hosts to participate in active participation . &quot;
attractive offers for Saturday and ren@@ unci@@ ation on parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potenti@@ als should be new or locked again . &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
&quot; however , many locals also have lost sight of the city center with shopping . &quot;
&quot; in the end , all would have to contribute to the city center - to landlords , the companies of the whole city and associations . &quot;
&quot; it came to overcome by a network the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy , which was partly broad@@ ened , had been king in spring . &quot;
&quot; Bir@@ git Stre@@ ich , Director of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen divided , that on the country@@ wide third &quot; &quot; home @-@ shopping cart &quot; &quot; day , five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities are taking part . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Wei@@ mar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and P@@ cher@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day should promote the appreciation of local trade and make its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; says Stre@@ ich . &quot;
the action under the Feder@@ ations of the I@@ HK and with many partners make it clear that every citizen could influence its direct surroundings even with its purchase behaviour .

&quot; among the dead , this was about employees of the school . &quot;
as a bl@@ iss@@ ful thing the authorities presum@@ ed working on a gas pipeline .
&quot; during the holiday season , only a few people stood in the building of the Minne@@ haha Academy . &quot;
Tru@@ mp continued after sal@@ ted tran@@ scription by phone call Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the boundary wall
tran@@ scripts of phone call between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post Office .
&quot; on 27 January Tru@@ mp in a telephone with the Mexican President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to , to be heard , publicly declar@@ ing that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the US president compl@@ ained because he had den@@ oun@@ ced the Wall publicly . according to that he said to him , &quot; &quot; This is the way you cannot say the press . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall to the southern edge of the USA , and s@@ wor@@ or to pay Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also released and exposed a tense exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ bull , that trade for the US refugees , who emig@@ rated to Australia , take over &quot; ridiculous , &quot; &quot; &quot; mies &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p , &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the US . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp did the call after he had told Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; this is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford @-@ massacre : activists run rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury was driving through a group of spectators in rural Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and ru@@ mp@@ ed on the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had to reach the bridge , a group of white men arose with rif@@ les in order to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ b - a man middle aged in a needle strip - took a long train at his ci@@ gar and looked after wind@@ shield .
indo@@ ors the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; br@@ ushed the man .
get it out of the car !
&quot; cri@@ es cr@@ ushed the silence , as a young black man was cr@@ ushed from the passenger . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , this horrible scene which was played on 22 July was only a replica . &quot;
&quot; but if then a sn@@ are thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; almost all of them in the audience is very real si@@ gh . &quot;
since 2005 citizens come back to the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in the two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Murray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
nobody ever was charged with the kill@@ ings .
&quot; it really is un@@ think@@ able that in all these years no single person was arrested - even though we see them in our communities , even though we know who they are , &quot; &quot; said T@@ yr@@ one Brooks , which helps in the organization of delivery . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt on a story , but it is a burden to our souls . &quot;
Brooks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former conven@@ tions of the State of Georgia and a lifetime of civil rights .
&quot; for him , it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual memory of the Mon@@ roe community that no injustice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want to pro@@ secution we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot reach healing and reconciliation , until we maintain justice . &quot;
a skir@@ mish takes a bed@@ sheet about the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ chen on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI &apos;s files , received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men were suspected of Mon@@ roe and the surrounding communities in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but none has ever been accused .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects for decades stay on free foot , civil rights say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions was always known throughout the city : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 made a decision of the Supreme Court of Human Rights , made it possible for the first time in Georgia for the first time in the summer for their voice . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time as choosing st@@ ach according to the F@@ BI of the black Far@@ mp@@ er Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - said to be a woman . &quot;
said the ru@@ mor in the city has been that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she had not were from her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to liber@@ ate Mal@@ com from the prison , so the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her C@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Murray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
&quot; but when she removed from the prison , and the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge appro@@ ached , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b turned the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison , who has prepared and arranged the kill@@ ings , &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a com@@ plac@@ ent between the state and local pro@@ secution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , expresses evidence and the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Brooks has made it even more enjoyable .
&quot; it was a electoral law massacre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , then this will happen . &quot;
Cass@@ andra is the annual re@@ position of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
&quot; their representation is vivid , po@@ ignant and is founded in a kind of deep racism , of which many believe that in America he does not exist anymore . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch , and look more difficult but Gre@@ ene said that that is the point . &quot;
&quot; we do not want to talk about the Lyn@@ chen , because we are confronted with this u@@ gl@@ iness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done through . &quot;
&quot; the samples for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors were pressed - a dozen white and the rest of the Black Sea - started a well @-@ played overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Green@@ it Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of the boss C@@ lan@@ tin for years , but he said the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to get this story alive , because we would not like to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room rehear@@ se the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester play their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester an@@ cri@@ es and pushed him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- He , swal@@ lowed from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona re@@ treats the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at lau@@ ghing .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ki@@ dy . &quot;
I just don &apos;t think that white people were told then &apos; n --- He &apos; .
&quot; but , humor@@ ously one of the other black actors . &quot;
you only have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
&quot; just as the energy shifts in space , a sense of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie replaced the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy with it , not only because of the game , but also because of memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene starts again .
&quot; this time , if Ras@@ cona says the N &apos;s Word , he says it is sharp and with re@@ printing . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends viol@@ ently and quickly .
&quot; there is scre@@ ams , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman cloth@@ ed with a funer@@ al dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actor and leads &quot; Che@@ ap Holidays &quot; and &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks out in every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen spectators sweat and tears out of the eyes .
the audience is divided into almost ev@@ enly between black and white .
&quot; a pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , arrived to see the performance , many come down only the road . &quot;
they all experienced almost eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as impres@@ sing humidity when Brooks is running them on a pilgrimage to the grave @-@ places of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; until that point , the kill@@ ings have stayed a anec@@ dote but now , when one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de has been , feels the air don@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; when the final notes of the song sounds , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to get closer and insp@@ ect the cor@@ pse . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ cken at their heads , register the fake blood and the calm body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ elt a little boy , when he wants to remember it . &quot;
after a few minutes thanks Gre@@ ene the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ ch@@ sei@@ l away and wi@@ pe her tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w embr@@ aces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the C@@ lan@@ son . &quot;
Nick Ras@@ cona ar@@ mt two of his fellow @-@ players and then breaks up in their arms and the emotional load of the performance eventually ends with him .
&quot; it is okay , whis@@ per@@ ing one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you did it for a reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience sets up with the actors for dinner together . &quot;
at a table ch@@ atting a white couple from Atlanta has stimulated the im@@ position with a black pair which they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski strug@@ gled to find words which feelings left the performance .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like yourself and do that , because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what that really is doing with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch is still going on , &quot; she added , &quot; today it is called the police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room T@@ yr@@ one Brooks courtyard keeps on his table , he e@@ ats and reminds of the civil rights . &quot;
he said he started to plan the performance next year .
&quot; it is in a certain way of inspir@@ ational , as it describes the horror of what we have en@@ du@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , he who does not know his own story is do@@ omed to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dä@@ mmerung &quot; re@@ conc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ re@@ uth
&quot; also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , Frank Cast@@ or@@ f continues on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e production in front of gigantic , six @-@ story scenery . &quot;
&quot; the turn@@ stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows a s@@ hab@@ by street corner of the L@@ C@@ rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; &quot; Pla@@ sts and Ela@@ ste &quot; &quot; logo from the GDR &apos;s time or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that par@@ ked an open Mercedes @-@ classic car , in which the Rhein@@ thal as rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls posi@@ eren , or alternatively a ic@@ setta . &quot;
&quot; em@@ bodied oil cas@@ ks remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and greed - that is st@@ aging through its &quot; Ring . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the three Rhein@@ tones - sung by Stephanie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful . &quot;
&quot; let them betra@@ y Sieg@@ fried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , cr@@ ushed a cor@@ pse in the trunk and enter the Kra@@ w@@ allo cli@@ que . &quot;
&quot; Stephen M@@ illing sings the gorgeous fi@@ ese Ha@@ gen , which surrounds the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight crown . &quot;
brutal the scene as he sm@@ iled Sieg@@ fried .
later you have to believe Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) .
the audience thanks it to the ensemble with powerful appl@@ ause .
&quot; Foster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , are bent in their humble way and hands on Merkel @-@ smoking . &quot;
&quot; great appl@@ ause for the concert band , which for the first time show on stage - in the face of the great heat again in loose leisure clothing . &quot;
with tension was the appearance of Frank Cast@@ or@@ f and his direc@@ et@@ e@@ am .
&quot; when he had to leave the same posts on himself in 2013 , there were five years later great rejo@@ icing in which the single &quot; &quot; Boo@@ h &quot; &quot; went down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have been happy about this .
&quot; one notes that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; in a certain way , just before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ or@@ f , but it was also an understanding of his view . &quot;
I prefer a positive summary .
max amount works as a volunteer
they work in their volunteer year at several locations .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture market , once a week I help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I have already worked in an open whole day on school .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it is a nice , wide spectrum I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late volunteer volunteer . &quot;
how does that come about ?
amount : I made Ab@@ it@@ ur .
&quot; and then a construction engineer , we say , successfully interrupted . &quot;
&quot; I recognized for me that it is the wrong one , and I want to do something else with people . &quot;
and then I asked myself what do you do .
&quot; make a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in focal point perhaps too , really . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter semester .
&quot; I will study dual , probably in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , I will make a social education and studying in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hochschule . &quot;
&quot; is it not something unusual , while the volunte@@ ering can have several different places of application ? &quot;
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it probably always comes to where to do his FS@@ J .
one can make it from the Alter@@ sheim until youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partially in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon support . &quot;
for me that was just the right thing that has caught me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
unlike in the construction studies ?
&quot; quantity : well , here it is not about to calculate st@@ atics . &quot;
&quot; one always has other people over the head , each of which have a completely different story . &quot;
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager had been brought up out of the family - you must always enter individually with it . &quot;
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : I am not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; much love , plenty of kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also some negative moments , but so life is just that . &quot;
Pear@@ son k@@ ens further 3.000 jobs and pl@@ unges the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
&quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , she will build another 3,000 jobs and cut off their inter@@ sections to 72 percent as another restructuring program will start to overcome the pressure by which the company is facing . &quot;

&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ bed was killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; in an opinion of NATO , it is said that the explosion happened on Thursday night , when a joint pat@@ rol was attacked by the Afgh@@ an army with the Afgh@@ an army attacked by a &quot; by persons . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all the wounded in a stable state can be found in a stable state and will be treated in the US military hospital in Bag@@ ram .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the Group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram . &quot;

EPA returns to delay the smo@@ g rule to cations
&quot; the US American environmental protection authority has a decision to delay the regulation of the government of Obama , repe@@ aled that the states are committed to com@@ bing the Smo@@ g @-@ convic@@ ting emissions . this was a day after 15 states had promised the agency due to the step@@ ping . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late last Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; o@@ zone @-@ regulations &quot; , &quot; and said they show the obligation of the agency to cooperate with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and in mind that we react to our state partners , &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA , the o@@ zone provisions which should be measured in a portion of the country damage emissions , to set out where inc@@ isions must be made to delay the stric@@ ter air standards - to delay one year until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 largely democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed on Tuesday , and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the Government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to rec@@ laim a broad range of environmental pollution , former President Barack Obama as a part of a wider agenda that aims to boost economic growth , according to Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; however , the efforts have spar@@ ked the set@@ back of the Democrats and reserves that are worried about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the website of EPA says that the inhal@@ ing of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; the lung function &quot; , &quot; as for example asthma . &quot;
con@@ feder@@ ate wants communal space
&quot; at the end , the decision was clear : with two oppos@@ ites the municipal council of Flu@@ orn winds , the establishment of a common area in the future senior plant . &quot;
in front of the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the missing basic piece was signed , Mayor Bernhard Tj@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although the church community has not yet been set up until the so far the church community is owned , but there is now no planning event for that of a private investor to st@@ em@@ ber@@ ing project more . &quot;
&quot; for this , there is a discussion concerning a common space . &quot;
&quot; one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered , to meet the congregation . &quot;
on the ground floor he would provide a living space - around 55 square meters and an adjoining terrace with a total of 70 square meters area for a special price .
&quot; the administration and the majority of the community @-@ state ho@@ vers , such a common area not only as a meeting point for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ just living , but openly into the community . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word made of &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; the round . &quot;
&quot; the decision will be made by the supply of funds for the current budget , already last autumn , by funding possibilities . &quot;
the building is situated in the san@@ itation area .
&quot; the establishment of a common area would be , so reports Tj@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent con@@ du@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the resolutions fores@@ ees to signal the investor to give him no bil@@ let between the legs , the finding that both s@@ add@@ led - what is reduced to the ambient temperature and the construction of economic power - is possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less , so do not just thinks Wil@@ fried So@@ mer , be this addition . &quot;
if it helps : unanim@@ ously he happens the panel .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation points to the many own buildings , with which you are not really progres@@ sing right now , let &apos;s rest in the common area from the window , says : &quot; I am struggling with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger necessarily speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it looks behind it a covered sub@@ type of missions or even foreign investors .
&quot; it is not so , because with the acquisition of the area one does not grant a supplement , but get a real one in doubt in doubt that the contra@@ indications . &quot;
&quot; state application , to request the resolutions accordingly , will find three advocates . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it remains with two oppos@@ ites at the original program to summar@@ ize Stefan H@@ aller : &quot; &quot; if we put the decision , we make a huge step in our infrastructure to close . &quot;

in the resin of star to star emig@@ rate
at the Har@@ z the country@@ wide first &quot; star@@ pf@@ ad &quot; arise .
this is planning the Club Ob@@ servatory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a planetary path is available in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; to meet the needs of many Har@@ z@@ go@@ ers , whose name was . &quot;
&quot; Connec@@ tors de Nature , Science , Motion and sporty Performance . &quot;
the members want to set up along the planned route tables and inform about stars and constell@@ ations .
&quot; in the first phase of 2018 , the association &quot; &quot; well achiev@@ able installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; ask St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Ho@@ he@@ avi@@ d and Sie@@ ber . &quot;
the information on the tablets should be comple@@ mented by Internet .
&quot; therefore , when a good mobile network is played a good mobile network . &quot;
also accessibility is a crit@@ erion .
later the star @-@ trail is meant to be extended by train .
&quot; on the star @-@ path the viewers experience a great deal of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; said the association . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star shot stronger than another one , although it is much further away . &quot;
&quot; also , in which constellation is medi@@ ated to find a selected star , and when he is best to see . &quot;
the association has been operating in the town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg for 2014 and is the highest located observ@@ atory Northern Germany since 2014 .
the centre in the middle of the National Park Har@@ z is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany on the basis of the Federal National Park in Germany .
frequently they are from there from the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galaxy with naked eye clearly .
in the university city there have been planet@@ arium since 2003 on the initiative of the Planet@@ arium . something similar to the planned star @-@ value - the planetary path .
&quot; starting in front of Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel near the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary path leads up to Hain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &apos; extr@@ ater@@ restrial site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality equ@@ als ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stel@@ ae with the single planet - including the dwarf plan@@ ed degra@@ ded Plu@@ to at the end point - are exactly at the distance and benchmark of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ unk thus to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the exactly 75 meters away from the sun passes 70 centimeters . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet is just four kilometers .
&quot; for the light of sun up to Plu@@ to about eight hours , pedest@@ rians need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
pedestrian are therefore faster than light in the cosmos .
the march to the next Fi@@ xed but would last a half year .
MI@@ KE@@ Y Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko meet for the first time and discuss a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko and MI@@ KE@@ Y Gar@@ cia , who should stand in a collision event in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ paved World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight Champion , the hall@@ way down to greet Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko , the World Bo@@ xing Organization super @-@ spring Champion . &quot;
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s win by a vote vote on the former four @-@ divisions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time both warri@@ ors are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ list .
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; How is it going to you Champion ? &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the couple reserved for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ no noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight &quot; , &quot; reminded Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I grew up for bron@@ er &#91; on 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to pull down to light weight .
and he must move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko was agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; climate @-@ climate asked if it should be at pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko will have to agree with an 135 @-@ pound debut in this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who is also interested in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell to its lightweight design fight in the forum on 23 September . &quot;
&quot; this struggle could take place in the pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans asked for him , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and expressed himself later , on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia he said Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko as &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; and he may also participate in his Saturday struggle .
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko stopped with the praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks he looks very slowly from River@@ side , sorry MI@@ KE@@ Y ... you wanted to see the co @-@ Aus . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said the focus is to show percus@@ sion@@ ists , then boxing . &quot;
&quot; both said they could feel the momentum , which was built for his own struggle . &quot;
&quot; this is the struggle , which needs to be carried out . &quot;
no other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko said : &quot; I have been waiting for the top fighters and that is MI@@ KE@@ Y .
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured after ty@@ re @-@ boards
during an accident at the A@@ 7 on Thursday afternoon four people were wounded in part .
&quot; after the first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira was lost shortly before the connecting point to the market , probably after a tire @-@ plat@@ ter control of his vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the passenger moves to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ beat and then lying on the roof in the green strip . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were badly injured during the accident .
&quot; during the initial supply of the last through the ambul@@ ance service , the A@@ 7 was locked in the north for about an hour , then the traffic could be subject to the left lanes from the accident position . &quot;
Fort@@ un@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; Trinity work better &quot;
&quot; Andre Hoffmann hopes for the 2 : 2 to the end of the season to Braunschweig , that will bring the optimization of the def@@ enses in Au@@ e points . &quot;
&quot; with the first season game , Andre Hoffmann was pleased with the result , there were not the two oppos@@ ites at 2 : 2 vs. Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ore too much , and we have to go even better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the defen@@ ders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge Mountains is to be optimized further .
and a gate after a fre@@ isto@@ ck would also no longer want to divide the Fort@@ un@@ as .
&quot; for the future , it will be that no longer next to Michael ( R@@ ational ) presents itself on line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better suited for the experience in preparation with the tri@@ bunal with the four @-@ pole .
&quot; I do not know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ man Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; &quot; because we have just finished in the Trinity on the semi @-@ positions in KA@@ AN Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ condition is , but that we are even better harmon@@ ize and we do not afford as many def@@ ici@@ encies . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but whether one can speak after a draw of a mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we stand on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly talk of a decent season op@@ ener . &quot;
of this his coach would not want to know anything .
&quot; I do not take the start of the season in the season after six to eight game days , &quot; said Fried@@ man Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony has to be can@@ cel@@ ed because of a storm . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season almost with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believes that players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her , because they could not have he@@ avier and complete games like Fort@@ una against an ascension @-@ fav@@ ored in the B@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know as 100 percent , where they are currently standing , &quot; says the interior of the Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; while guests from the Rhin@@ eland are leaving the Rhin@@ eland as an easy favourite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we throw them away , only because we have the claim to come among the first Six is rub@@ b@@ ish , &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive in just a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga that must strike from before , &quot; explains Fort@@ un@@ as &apos;s coach . &quot;
to meet such a statement would be arrogant and exagger@@ ated .
and so Funk@@ el wants to no longer experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum tests releases
&quot; the recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , under@@ gone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish Authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Rä@@ tt@@ s@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has started implementing the tests last year .
&quot; they should make a closer look at the assessment of the age during the asylum process , after the Swedish migration authorities ( migration ) had been critic@@ ised for the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were under@@ age . &quot;
&quot; up to date , migration cuts of 6.@@ 8@@ 80 has been sent to test@@ ing cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2.@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were considered to be 18 or older while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency reported that the person was &quot; &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 years old .
the tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is ques@@ tioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson , by the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results for the past months are constant . &quot;
&quot; we do not see a big difference in statistics of the past few months , the numbers are rather consistent , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases where the person has been judged as more than 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er about its age . &quot;
&quot; in May the Agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there were 4@@ 42 cases that suggest &quot; &quot; suggest that the sub@@ servi@@ ced person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska Dag@@ bla@@ zes the results published by 5@@ 81 , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that they will be 18 years old this year . &quot;
the method of medical age assessment to be made in the x @-@ rays of Weis@@ sen@@ tia and MRT @-@ recordings of knee @-@ induced and radi@@ ologist was also cri@@ tici@@ zed in some areas .
&quot; a scep@@ tics is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus the Kar@@ ol@@ inska @-@ Institute , whose work consists of ass@@ essing the biological maturity of people to see if they were earlier or later than usually by pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
evaluating the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; if we cannot say it certainly , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson is defended by the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , the accuracy of the tests : &quot; generally you can say that the risk that a child is un@@ correct as an adult . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is when the person is below 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully on the plan
work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg come well ahead .
on Wednesday there was a seven tons of heavy emphasis on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold L@@ asi@@ er , Director at the Department of street and Transport in the Board of Govern@@ ors Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the works began at the same time on all three re@@ constructed bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the building is scheduled for October and it is sure that the schedule is maintained .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ ault bridge made of concrete , which is ar@@ ra@@ yed with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters . &quot;
built in 1900 .
&quot; like the other two bridges , it is now in the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure the stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly insp@@ ected . &quot;
the two other bridges are running via the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , and 10.@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now been on the mid@@ day tomorrow on the north side of a 1.@@ 30 meters wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called br@@ ush@@ cap .
this is a mar@@ ginal fix@@ ation that is also used as a plant .
on the southern part of the bridge the bridge is to be used on Friday a 2.@@ 20 meters wide br@@ ush@@ cap .
then the pedestrian road should then go .
&quot; the special thing is that it deals with components , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ z@@ where . &quot;
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented frac@@ tures .
special finger@@ tips will require the embarrass@@ ment of cables due to the construction work in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; because there is also a glass label , connected to which many companies are connected . &quot;
the residents were informed about the project in advance of the work through hand@@ ish@@ list .
&quot; furthermore , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the Bau@@ hof@@ stadt and the collecting , towards Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light . &quot;
for construction work on the bridge at Lau@@ ter@@ bacher village entrance is the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Si@@ eving Lin@@ den . &quot;
the cost of the three frac@@ ckers will amount to 700 000 Euro .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : colorful protest with german potato salad
&quot; it does not come so often that parties pull in a rope , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , comes together , what else is difficult to bring under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in the Krem@@ lin volcano policies ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance that live on this day peacefully . &quot;
&quot; well known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land is the top duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September , and the Vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix von Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; however , who are on site already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D Group but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally the city @-@ picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the fountain square , but is now taking place on the parking place below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who go to Af@@ ak @-@ Event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers itself there .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair of the Forum A world and one of the leading organis@@ ers , really pleased : &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &apos; German potato salad , which could also eat Af@@ D without any problem , &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot;
&quot; the police have given many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence above all also at the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported from the Af@@ D volcano cr@@ aps which he dedicated himself to such an event and get the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had welcomed first in Dau@@ n , but there is a cancellation because due to the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes there are not enough parking available . &quot;
&quot; so , the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; overlooking the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; it also does : against 20 o &apos;clock , the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz is a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle diverse speakers , including the Rhin@@ eland @-@ pf@@ alz Af@@ ak @-@ president Uwe Young . &quot;
&quot; in the Hall , about 200 list@@ eners , who are waiting for the top can@@ did@@ acy for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; the police presence remained unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; something more than one hour is the Af@@ D event , the guests at the court have a longer breath , but also there is briefly at 9 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can back - no special incidents .

both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and made sol@@ op@@ osi@@ tions in European top orchest@@ ras .
Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ hes is the SW@@ R symph@@ ony orchestra .
&quot; they both bind the lust , not only to cross the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the limits of the different genres . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &quot; world music , &quot; united with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the J@@ az@@ ze@@ ch@@ op@@ lan@@ ger N@@ ils W@@ ogram . &quot;
this core of the program was first performed by this spring with great success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram was written for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher monastery church with its special acousti@@ cs is deliberately included in the concert .
Kr@@ isten Stewart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of her life .
&quot; but I want to try out everything , &quot; says Kr@@ isten Stewart just over their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; once I am in grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship of the Hol@@ ly@@ ric stars was the one to her &quot; t@@ wilight &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ an , which eventually was bitter apart . &quot;
&quot; in spite of all that assured the brunette Dar@@ stell@@ erin compared to the &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; I was very seriously in love which I used . &quot;
&quot; or do you believe , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation , Kr@@ isten had to say that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual , &quot; &quot; I always lived and seriously believed in du@@ alism . &quot;
so it has never been confused or disabled .
&quot; I just liked it , not seriously treated . &quot;
&quot; especially among them have suffered loud &quot; &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; &quot; but in school days when she would rather like a bu@@ b , &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really hurt me very badly .
&quot; when I was eleven , I told me the children , I would look like a boy . &quot;
I really felt attacked and embarrass@@ ed and ashamed .
&quot; now I look back and think to me , &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; especially the general public they would not like to give their love life : &quot; people expect you to form a certain way , and that is angry . &quot;
&quot; perhaps some thought about being un@@ think@@ able , but I don &apos;t like it to justify myself before the whole public . &quot;
the governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening with President Tru@@ mp , that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with a lot of prayers and a lot of thinking ... today , I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you when I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the manifestation collap@@ sed in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; Justice added . &quot;
&quot; as a coach , I would say that it is time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp promised a great announcement on West Virginia rally .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice not endor@@ sed the democratic candidate of Hill@@ ary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; Justice , which is according to For@@ bes of the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; For@@ bes notes that he has coal mines in five states , and inherited a carbon business from his father . &quot;
it is worth approximately 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime the Republican National Committee on Thursday evening gave an explanation : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party , who were more likely to work out to do our country again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 govern@@ ors and the control of the least legal entities in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership , and is unable to find a positive , engaging message , said the R@@ NC @-@ chairman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in a statement by the C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; hon@@ orable &quot; Russian ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; the global leader of the Athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday , what he described as an open excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal but he repeated , it was not the moment for the country to get back into the sport . &quot;
Russia &apos;s Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tik @-@ Chief Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Athle@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; all athletes , those in cont@@ ests gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban that was done in November 2015 , after a report of the world @-@ anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( W@@ ada ) had found evidence on state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the re@@ porters . &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognised with itself , that some pretty hot days has experienced and everything possible to make sure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; that Russia has accepted the criteria for re @-@ introduction . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been achieved , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the cor@@ rupted system , &quot; he added &quot;
&quot; ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world champi@@ on@@ ships who start Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral parties . &quot;
&quot; the director of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Andersen , said on Monday that Russia had to meet some of the criteria for a re@@ mission . &quot;
&quot; dru@@ g@@ tests were still inadequate and banned trainers were still free , he said re@@ porters in London after a presentation at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
funer@@ al act in Mali cr@@ ushed soldiers
at a funer@@ al celebration in the north@@ h@@ ess@@ ischer Frit@@ z@@ lar have thought about 1000 people of the two at a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precau@@ tions .
&quot; to the still un@@ explained crash , Secretary of Defence in Ursula by the Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing . &quot;
&quot; they called the two in@@ comes pilots , but as &quot; &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their specialist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow to this highest sacrifice , which they delivered in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; stated her . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen were born on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali .
her S@@ är@@ ge were transferred to Germany and brought to Thursday by a Tot@@ en@@ wake of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
&quot; at noon , only the relatives were at the church f@@ arewell . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funer@@ al celebration began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics . &quot;
among them were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the Gover@@ ning Board of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; grapes laid down roses , the relatives were arm in arm to the sin@@ king . &quot;
in front of the church Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on one canvas .
&quot; Secretary of the Le@@ yen called the &quot; &quot; commented soldiers &quot; &quot; decorated with &quot; &quot; High &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the rod @-@ capit@@ mann promised the flight operation of the Kampf@@ hu@@ b@@ Scre@@ w Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six @-@ trained tiger pilots of his reg@@ iment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ achs , commander of the Reg@@ iment , to which the soldiers belong , stated : &quot; &quot; if this occupation could not turn the crash , it would not have been mo@@ cked . &quot;
doubts about the UN Mission in Mali showed the Minister of Le@@ yen : the mission is dangerous .
&quot; but he was also of great importance &quot; to a country , from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
after the funer@@ al celebration the s@@ cour@@ ge were brought out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they were buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did no information . &quot;
prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried in his wife after his death . &quot;
this shared the Royal House on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish roy@@ alty is set in the cathedral @-@ church of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard already made a coff@@ in for the two .
the Queen was in agreement with the decision of her husband called it in the message .
where prince Hen@@ rik is buried ; be still unclear .
but he did not have the intention of being joined in his French country .
prince Hen@@ rik had never made a tro@@ ehl from it that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne ascent of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ ens in 1972 he would be a king .
&quot; in 2016 , he went into retirement and also sets the title &quot; &quot; prin@@ cipl@@ ed hl &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - also not after death , &quot; &quot; L@@ ene ballet &quot; &quot; said chief spokes@@ person on the Danish King &apos;s house . &quot;
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year will be ultimately still unclear .
&quot; but he did not have the intention of being set in his French country , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the land for which he has worked in the last 50 years .
&quot; born Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French President , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
at the Thames he worked in the French embassy .
&quot; during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people always flo@@ ated , prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 years of reg@@ ister@@ ing in the Dan@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik spoke about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was sw@@ inging , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk @-@ sm@@ ur@@ fs instead of Stri@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ vel@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco and that this country had the call to be the brand of social @-@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .
these were the same two bugs ! &quot;
Prime Minister Because I want fast re@@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of a majority in Lower Saxony .
&quot; disrup@@ tions Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green government majority for a swift re@@ election of the day , but he doesn &apos;t want to go back . &quot;
&quot; because , on Friday , she spoke out for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; previously , the surprising withdrawal of a Gre@@ ens MEPs from their country @-@ vote in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) . &quot;
five months before the official date of the election @-@ election the red @-@ green coalition in Hannover therefore lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ vote majority in parliament on the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Green MP El@@ ke T@@ west created their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Desert ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she stated on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
CD@@ U Leader Björ@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend it to his faction .
&quot; we would have CD@@ U and F@@ DP together 69 seats in the Lower Saxony , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
hitherto the relationship was conver@@ sely .
the new country tag will be elected on 14 January of next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red green government government must decide now whether they could continue in this situation without a majority .
&quot; however , Stephan Wei@@ l holds it indispensable for the fact that the country tag allows as soon as possible its self @-@ solution . &quot;
the CD@@ U group is expected to decide on Tuesday about their further action .
the state of the country also sees the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s parliament draws the confidence and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot;
&quot; these options must be legally checked properly , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all questions in peace if they are legally reasonable . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; but something cur@@ vy .
the Policy myself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
they called itself as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens urged the ab@@ om@@ ers to return to the return of their country @-@ day trade .
&quot; we are of course assuming that they have received their land list , which they have received via the Green state list , returns with immediate effect , the state of Meta Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; said vice @-@ president of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel , &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ wilight extraordinary . &quot;
they have chosen not to lead a pron@@ unci@@ ation in the Group .
&quot; even before the background , there was no content differences , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot;
SPD &apos;s chan@@ cell@@ or President Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens of El@@ ke T@@ west to the CD@@ U as betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behavior of the former Green Party of Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the voters and voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the head of the Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
&quot; he support the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , to quickly choose the country &apos;s day . &quot;
&quot; the outlet T@@ west@@ ens cost red @-@ green in Nieder@@ s@@ achsen , the majority . &quot;
&quot; the political scientist &quot; &quot; in her last vanity and in her frustration her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus &apos;s salvation . &quot;
&quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U is involved in Lower Saxony , this dirty ind@@ rical drama and tries to beat out of this political capital . &quot;
low @-@ fac@@ tions CD@@ U @-@ fac@@ tional Court Björ@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler will recommend to his MEPs to absorb El@@ ke T@@ west into the CD@@ U .
&quot; leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw the life@@ jackets to fal@@ si@@ fy the outcome of the election @-@ election 2013 . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was at that time before the SPD &apos;s strongest strength , SPD and Green had a big @-@ thin majority of a voice . &quot;
&quot; agricultural ministers in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discusses about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Mr. Schmidt : how can consumers protect the consumer from pois@@ oned eggs ?
&quot; I can only encourage all the consumer inside and to encourage consumers to look at the eggs in your refrigerator , and to check the st@@ amping pressure . &quot;
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Bundes@@ länder will provide the latest information on the affected eggs . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; also , if after all we currently know a health danger is practically excluded . &quot;
now Al@@ di is over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the supervis@@ or of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture is not really perceived ?
the food monitoring is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately switched off immediately and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade has just the same as the manufacturer concern for ensuring that the sold @-@ selling products are viable and health harmless .
&quot; if at eggs of the resi@@ due content of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , this is not viable . &quot;
un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed .
this time is not to blame for this time .
do production companies and consumers sit in the same boat ?
after the high level of level the production industry does not meet an immediate fault .
&quot; rather , they have to reck@@ on because of deliber@@ ate illegal practices of service companies with economic damage . &quot;
as always there is too little controversy in the harvest .
is there only a lack of staff or at the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
&quot; however , it was precisely the official controls that have uncovered the process . &quot;
&quot; however , the truth is also that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded from 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; this is why a consistent clarification of such events and the hand@@ over to the pro@@ secution in the cases , in which criminal offen@@ ders may be , of crucial importance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear that I expect the responsible authorities to provide a complete enlightenment . &quot;
is the regular alarm at food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; consumer consumers and consumers have the right to obtain solely secure and traffic @-@ capable foods . &quot;
&quot; if a non @-@ profit insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food economy , consumers and consumers are entitled to law . &quot;
&quot; due to the pan@@ elled means manufacturers , merchants and consumers are advised into a situation which is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ zi@@ ds Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ fabri@@ cated animals is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately . &quot;
it must be consistent on all levels and worked with high pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from all relevant authorities , that the atomic facts will be quickly absorbed . &quot;
how the financial rules of Football on Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s moves to Paris
&quot; the rules that aim at this aim to prevent un@@ inhi@@ bited editions of European football , Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord @-@ Transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain will not distur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Germain of the UEF@@ A , as the executive organisation who over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair @-@ Play rules , which were launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G has to point out sometime , that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar has been financed without great losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million $ ) to store the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary that will amount several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s moves to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make sure to make money loose , so that Ne@@ ym@@ ar will sign up and bring it into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy rich mist@@ ress of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; associations are allowed to raise a lot of money for the purchase of players , but must be controlled with legitimate income of income , which allow them to allow the break @-@ even point in their play to football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Pl@@ ini by his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
&quot; former French player believed that associations in their quest for success have taken tremendous debts to themselves , effectively dec@@ ei@@ ving and ris@@ ki@@ fied to ruin , when banks or owner returned their support . &quot;
in 2011 FF@@ P reported from the concentration on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses .
&quot; the change meant that the business model , which was acquired by Roman Abr@@ amo@@ vich originally in 2003 - a club with potential bought and then power@@ fully invested to build the team and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year @-@ old FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses in the amount of 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; and although Pl@@ ini fell from the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEF@@ A @-@ successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to be deter@@ red by excessive expenses . &quot;
&quot; sure , FF@@ P is not dead and we will surely strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so who is responsible at the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a p@@ auses , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract . &quot;
Ne@@ ym@@ ar signed a five @-@ year contract for the next five years in the amount of 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million euros in the end of the year .
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has met PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a money penalty of 60 million Euros ( at that time , 82 million dollars ) , which later became reduced to 20 million Euros - and it was arranged that the team members are limited for the Champions League of the 2014 season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of normal 25 players . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs , which could try to bri@@ dging its financial view by exporting their revenue by companies that are connected with the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a cat@@ ar@@ ic company could spontaneous the PS@@ G if the value of the sponsor@@ ing should exceed the default market sets , the UEF@@ A would not be considered as legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; just that happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ing of the P@@ SA was blo@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar could come across payments of the organizational committee of the World Cup 2006 in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have denied that Ne@@ ym@@ ar World Cup will be easy to figure out and find such a man@@ oeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A is even more attractive , to consider any attempt to handle the rules . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A had no pre @-@ prepared discussions with PS@@ G about Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not entitled to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
the recent published reports indicate that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has generated a profit of € 54@@ 2.4 million for a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year must still be published .
PS@@ G expects Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for Sponsor@@ ing De@@ als and merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot@@ ics .
the association assumes that sales after signing at least 30 percent will increase .
&quot; the Spanish league was clearly irrit@@ ated , one of the best football players go to see , and tried to prevent Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s departure by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regards to Qatar &apos;s last owner . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state that is funded by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has completely changed the entire landscape of Football in the past 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country possesses an association , everything is possible . &quot;
it will be very difficult to respect the Financial Fair@@ play because you can different ways or have different interests if a country has such great player to represent a country .
Swiss is in search of a new v@@ og@@ gi@@ ver
in the past few years chocol@@ at Fre@@ y aboard @-@ chocolate has made chocol@@ ates for the Swiss .
&quot; now , the next cooperation is ahead of a possible end : the airline will write the order newly . &quot;

&quot; yet , more important is the promotional effect : for a sc@@ og@@ gi@@ ver , it is a prestigious assignment . &quot;
&quot; as many of the Candi@@ dates there are in the new tender , Swiss will not want to betra@@ y . &quot;
but in question only Swiss manufacturers come .
&quot; according to the newspaper report , chocol@@ at Fre@@ y wants to strive for a renewal of the Treaty establishing the Spring in 2018 . &quot;
the S@@ DA was the largest Swiss Cho@@ col@@ ate manufacturer not available for an opinion .
chocol@@ ates tablets distributed the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
&quot; before Swiss signed a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had a collaboration with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets . &quot;
&quot; the opportunity to place the logo , Swiss and two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with chocol@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;

&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; was surprisingly good , not only because of his absur@@ dity ( it contained a original story for a speaking of vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; in boo@@ sts the core of the g@@ ags - actor middle @-@ ages play hor@@ ny children , who will grow - nevertheless they managed to gain the im@@ possibility of the last part of the weather . &quot;
&quot; ten Years , with his adults who are playing adults now , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy are more after the found@@ ling principle , among them a riff on the stal@@ ker movies of the 90 @-@ s as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; &quot; ( &quot; The Hand who sp@@ elt the cradle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; at one point , a character by a Apple Power@@ book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the gracious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ ers ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not yet lost its vir@@ gin@@ ity .
and there is another crazy mal@@ ignant plot in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ ers ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always the ex@@ courses are the best part of franchise .
&quot; it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt D@@ ill@@ ons sub@@ ordination of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old b@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; there are the moments of acci@@ dental madness that could heat this franchise as a sort of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he reaches what I &apos;ll show as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; &quot; show how she will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now reminis@@ cent of another kind of nostal@@ gia : to re @-@ rev@@ itali@@ zation of the Cold War by &quot; The Americans , &quot; the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ low &quot; with his East @-@ West Ring@@ ling @-@ I@@ con@@ ographie . &quot;
&quot; accompanied by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka @-@ created comedy with Rh@@ &apos;s Thomas as director there , a spotted TV show : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , ath@@ e@@ ism and the path of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; the main protagonist - a hard @-@ minded Gregor and an ide@@ alistic Io@@ sef - played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u U@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt can be syn@@ ced in English . &quot;
it is an ingenious idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some beautiful g@@ ags to see ( the police spend time on TV to watch chess on TV how Americans might do it with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ am Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides the voice for a decent play &apos; Fin@@ de &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; is very committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a dou@@ bt@@ ful propaganda scene - a mur@@ derer who carries a Re@@ agan mask , is involved - that it is often like a single one . &quot;
&quot; six long episodes go there , and the comedy is not fast or often enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who was re@@ arranged on a lesser length , could deliver his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p S@@ ati@@ re , since Gregor and Io@@ sef continues to visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the en@@ forced communist audience is that Western culture can make all the food for a money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian Creator is not wrong : we do it even with our own younger history and theirs .
blow against drugs on drugs in the country
the police was a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; in the mid @-@ day tomorrow , the Black @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ because , Constance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart have been searched for numerous objects as the pro@@ secution of Constance on Friday . &quot;
15 compl@@ ained of the age of 25 years and 77 years were arrested and issued an arrest warrant against this .
&quot; the official large quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , sho@@ ot@@ ings , as well as several hundred thousand Euros are sure . &quot;
in the same swe@@ eps in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Italians there were German arrest warrant .
the two are therefore probably delivered to Germany .
the action was Italian and Bav@@ arian investig@@ ators involved .
&quot; overall , more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Mafia will be organised against drug de@@ crimin@@ ality , serious violence , attempted murder , as well as rob@@ bery and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; already since summer 2016 , the pro@@ secutor &apos;s office has been determined against organised drug trading in the southern German area . &quot;
&quot; between the Pro@@ secution &apos;s Office of Constance and Palermo , an infectious exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ da had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily . &quot;
therefore the big effort was accompanied by four officials from Palermo in the mid @-@ day tomorrow .
in the cros@@ sha@@ fts of the studies mainly Italian citizenship are related to the Italian ma@@ fia .
&quot; even an incident occurred on 27 May in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant in the morning , might go to the account of the gang . &quot;
ways compl@@ ains about large gaps in the foreig@@ ner register
&quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear here &quot; &quot; : a report that the foreig@@ ner stops in Germany has significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this lead to partly gra@@ zing mis@@ calculations in asylum procedures .
&quot; nominated for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen , a media report also draws attention to large gaps in the country @-@ country register . &quot;
&quot; short@@ com@@ ings in the recorded data could result in asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations &quot; in partly gra@@ zing failures , &quot; warned in an analysis that the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; is present . &quot;
&quot; according to the property , the data is estimated ten million people with foreign nationality , including 5,@@ 7 million out of non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data is managed by approximately 600 international authorities in Germany .
&quot; because the data was not adequately maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far . &quot;
&quot; data were found in cases of 1921 , &quot; by people who have long been no longer alive , or from citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data contained can considerably slow down re@@ treats , meaning the report continues . &quot;
&quot; in the statistics about im@@ pass@@ able people , the EU citizens are recorded , who would not have to leave all of them . &quot;
&quot; but such a false state , however , led to an distorted debate on dealing with voting rights , &quot; says it in the analysis . &quot;
meanwhile the Federal Government has apparently begun to return refugee families with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children if they arrived from there .
this consists of an internal paper of the Federal Office of Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BAM@@ F ) reported the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Newspaper . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in paper it is said that BAM@@ F perform such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and to@@ dd@@ lers - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , it was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; according to the Dublin agreement , the EU is responsible for refugees to arrive at first . &quot;
&quot; if a migrant to travel to another EU country , this state can return it to the entry country . &quot;
&quot; for the reason , the office is now writing : &quot; meanwhile , the recording capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has increased substantially . &quot;
Italy have handed over to the inclusion and accommodation of families guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( E@@ GM@@ R ) hold this commitments for sufficient .
other EU states would also send it to refugees in the context of Dublin agreement .
&quot; the internal political spokes@@ man in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , cri@@ tici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children have thre@@ aten this decision : &quot; families with children due to the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system of un@@ lawful recording conditions and an endanger@@ ment of the child . &quot;
second result achiev@@ es
a total of 220 liters of blood of in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach living people was already available for other people .
&quot; at least by the twelve citizens , who were awarded on Friday . &quot;
&quot; thanks to all Jürgen Gre@@ ule , he has now divided up 50 lit@@ res of blood with his now 100 donations . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the church in the session of the community is the most frequent read@@ iness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is brilliant as our body is laid out for it and we respect the don@@ ors , who provide their blood for strangers , nor are un@@ sel@@ fish , under@@ lining Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood pressure helps several people , &quot; explained the circle leader of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , for the preser@@ ves are broken into their components . &quot;
three people could benefit from a blood pressure .
&quot; at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported from the actions taken in spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year , with 114 don@@ ors , we achieved the second best result , &quot; said the DR@@ K cycles . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change in the theatre House has led to higher number of participants only a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; previously they counted Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Meta Um@@ berry to the multi@@ fac@@ ets and were awarded for 50 &apos; blood don@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; half as many book Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ ro@@ mmer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe Vet@@ ter gave ten times the 500 milli@@ liter of her livel@@ ihood . &quot;
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England will probably be announced later that the interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the shut@@ down of inflation raised the spec@@ ulations over a rise .
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; s@@ lugg@@ ish &quot; than it held the interest rates on family income in the middle of a reinfor@@ cing pressure .
&quot; the Bank decision makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 that interest rates on 0.@@ 25 % , whereas the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 at 1.7 % and for 2018 on 1,6 % and warned that the pressure on the budget would continue , whereby the inflation in autumn is expected to rise to almost 3 % . &quot;
&quot; but they have realized that the coming years of interest were necessary to provo@@ ke the inflation in the next few years , and she said that the loan costs would have to rise more than expected on the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; the members also voted to withdraw a part of the mamm@@ oth @-@ economic package , which was published a year after the Bre@@ xit . &quot;
&quot; it will demand time for the financial plan for banks to provide cheaper funds for banks starting from the next February , although it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product remains weak , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to be charged consumption . &quot;
&quot; at the interest rates , it repeated that &quot; &quot; a certain for@@ estation of monetary policy &quot; &quot; is required to reduce inflation and a &quot; &quot; somewhat larger &quot; &quot; scale than the markets . &quot;
the markets forecasts the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank stressed that there would be &quot; gradual &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to corrected , growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % . &quot;
it has retained its growth forecast for 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell to the dollar after these messages and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.@@ 4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
the decision to no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have been vacc@@ inated and the GDP in the second quarter of 0.@@ 2 % in the previous three months have increased to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
&quot; growth in the third quarter is expected to be 0,3 % during the third quarter , although it will be easy to recover after the Bank in the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the most recent In@@ fl@@ ation@@ Report provides little enthusiasm for households who are affected by a rising inflation and lesser salary , as the shar@@ pen@@ ing is still worse before it will improve . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy in the next few years could not prevent the income of income , &quot; but she added that wages will be clearly reco@@ vering from the end of their three @-@ year &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound is due to what a portion of lower consumption is compens@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes a year after lowering the interest rates on 0.@@ 25 % last August after the shocking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ ks of the pose . &quot;
&quot; the bank appreci@@ ates that it will likely take four years , until this will achieve the prices and the economy . &quot;
&quot; prior to the last sentence of the Bank on the interest rates , the call for a interest rate increased since inflation increased the pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , whereas three political decision @-@ makers in July had a rise to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation is dropped last month by 2,@@ 9 % in June to 2,@@ 6 % although the bank said that this was expected and will come back in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said the trans@@ gression in relation to its objective of 2 % is to be added to the weak pound .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ aut Bro@@ kers said : &quot; &quot; given the recent review of the S@@ wa@@ p instal@@ ment , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive again since the len@@ ders are looking for business and end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing degeneration end and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is to prescri@@ be a controversial HIV @-@ drug 10,000 people . &quot;
patients will receive access to a &apos; trans@@ formative &apos; HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the medicine in the N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that prior to the sexual intercourse the pre@@ dominant prophy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can decrease the risk of infection in high @-@ risk reduction by about 86 percent , is now supplied by health care than a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the process after the Appe@@ al Court held a judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice in the past year , according to which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should pay it . &quot;
&quot; the catalogue was announced on Thursday by N@@ HS England boss Simon Stev@@ ens as an &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) announced this as the &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to follow the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October 2018 in the whole of England . &quot;
prevention re@@ positioning prophy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p reduces HIV transfer in infection risk .
&quot; pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means , that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection . &quot;
such medicines can be taken every day or so already two hours before the intercourse .
&quot; to those who come to issue are gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been treated successfully . &quot;
&quot; clinics are identified to identify most of the study including men , women , transfers , and individuals who have a partner whose HIV state is not known to be controlled by anti @-@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
&quot; people who are living in England and registered with a house@@ keeper , can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic . &quot;
the program will include £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive sourcing .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by which clinical evidence is collected , as it is targeted and implemented in a large scale . &quot;
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and expand the extensive and increasingly successful efforts to contrac@@ ting HIV . &quot;
it &apos;s another milestone in which more than three decades continued progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , if it is targeted to needy and end@@ owed people , the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic . &quot;
&quot; from September to become people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed trial in England , in order to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and is not subject to a trial with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority now must lie that the study is quickly carried out across the country and that no one who has left a risk for HIV . &quot;
&quot; now as the pre@@ p test medicine was created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , shadow @-@ health Minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome after months of delays and delays by the government and over@@ due . &quot;
the evidence showing how trans@@ formative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and to contribute to it that we get a step closer to the end of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
the big life live : me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine and clever designer tricks have this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment transformed into a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , res@@ isted in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne took their pockets un@@ packed and sold .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; I searched for something , which was comparable to my price . &quot;
I was shown in Ear@@ ls Court this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
I loved it in love and made an offer this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square feet was completely obsol@@ ete . &quot;
originally a one @-@ bedroom property with a vei@@ led layout - one needed to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add a shower room and a me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my requirement , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; to this end , she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill to use the 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms to each other , so that the architectural challenge was to create a me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine in which one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think creative thinking to resolve the pre @-@ release .
&quot; the steel plant is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked one another , without having to wi@@ gs ourselves . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to set the steel so that he had the right height at the top or at the bottom . &quot;
this arrangement allowed it Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amorous living area .
&quot; mir@@ r@@ ored gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and Vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting put the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; mir@@ rors play a role in addition to theatre , space and light . &quot;
at both ends a short corridor mir@@ r@@ ored to make him last longer .
in the kitchen the mir@@ r@@ oring feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance mir@@ r@@ ored units can accommodate all records and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amorous body , the beauty of the housing can include the kitchen when it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering worked out there , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered M@@ DF @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; it is very important , so that if you slide the door very easily . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the basics - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will occur and a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
&quot; here , they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high quality materials that give space to the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional attachment in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love you into the electric plug @-@ ins in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they are not playing with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square meters of something standard in something quite amazing .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave these . &quot;
brothers are fighting for a 500 million US dollar property imperial .
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , in a confrontation because of one of the largest real estate imperial Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former Director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Colin De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and its business will be divided . &quot;
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice .
&quot; together with her mother Anna , brothers 38 Real Estate joined the value of more than half a billion dollars , gathered since the 1973 bought a business in Smith Street , Col@@ ling@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail shops . &quot;
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
&quot; this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now comprises offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; according to an agreement with her late father , Colin - described by Paul as the &quot; master driver and the dominant personality &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis , about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
&quot; this means that Colin property means that Colin property is worth $ 3@@ 16 million , and Paul in the value of 17@@ 6 million dollars . &quot;
the distribution of real estate and cash has proven to be a problematic point for Paul .
&quot; the press proposed by Colin proposed him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot;
last Friday the first hearing from the Supreme Court of Justice took place last Friday .
&quot; the brothers are now fighting for control of existing business - which Colin , as Paul claimed to have excluded him . &quot;
&quot; Colin ar@@ gues that this was not true , but raises Paul to manage some possessions . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it , which was submitted by Colin , he says he was hoping to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cost increases in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading attor@@ neys , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides reserved . &quot;
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were the Italian immig@@ rant who had been in the dairy bars and del@@ i @-@ shops from the late 1950 &apos;s and in the early seventies conducted a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
&quot; they used the security to buy the Col@@ ling@@ wood property , opened in the Colin the first Je@@ ans@@ as family . &quot;
&quot; Colin says that he began West@@ co , when he was in my last years of High School , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , had hoped to pass their property rem@@ uner@@ ated to their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi said to me , that he never wanted to land the brothers before the court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , whereby Colin claimed that Mark had paid 10 million dollars in leaving the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark were , so Paul &quot; has been bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Colin has kept very back although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from the year 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; only Colin answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; I really can not say much &quot; &quot; because the case before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to shor@@ ten me and to draw our family name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tries to fulfill the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father would not have felt that Paul and me would end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; he said and added that he still hope for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be resolved in the near future of the courts &quot; , &quot; wrote Colin . &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s of new staff leader plans to limit the media ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and are wel@@ ded .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first one . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico reports that the new staff of the White House is planning to limit the information flow of President Tru@@ mp , including the reports of news media - in the hope of keeping the boss on an equal course . &quot;
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new chief of Staff of the White House , on his first day of working with leading employees , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s White House which he repaired Sh@@ ook : bad information , which entered into the hands of the President . &quot;
&quot; Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in stamp - because the president would make better decisions , if he would get good information . &quot;
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnostics makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitoring its media . &quot;
&quot; President Tru@@ mp@@ s relationship with television reaches decades back - and now , where he is in the White House , his tel@@ ev@@ ation is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if the candidate of Tru@@ mp was anno@@ yed because of a fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of jobs that were to convince , &quot; &quot; said the former election consultant Sam Nun@@ berg in February towards Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; &quot; the key to hold tru@@ mp Twitter habit under control , according to six former election officials in it , to ensure that his personal media use includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit ever has &quot; under control &quot; is ridiculous .
perhaps this campaign officials know something that we do not know - that Tru@@ mp@@ s twe@@ ets could have a more ig@@ nition without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp has not sent .
&quot; if his staff was able to keep it away some times the trouble from him , then their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
but no one has consistently prevented that Tru@@ mp controversy calls out controversi@@ es .
&quot; part of the problem exists in the fact that people in a white house made up of competing parties , and again and again try to present their own agenda by promoting Tru@@ mp Materials , which possibly encourages their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the fon@@ dness of the consultants , the President of strategic reasons desper@@ ate information . &quot;
&quot; this was an example , which was described by Reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher : &quot;
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp be@@ amer say that Tru@@ mp like a volcano can react to negative press releases , above all such with sh@@ ame@@ ful le@@ aks , and that he should find out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; this happened at the end of February , when someone was forced to copy an printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy commander of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a bunch of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
although Johnson was ban@@ ished because of Shi@@ kan@@ en permanently from Twitter or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has expressed wrong accus@@ ations in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke it .
Tru@@ mp read the article and began to ask for employees about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ ac@@ emaker added that the former chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage the pap@@ er@@ work and document the Tru@@ mp . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries to do the same for three months later .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself more effective as a prime manager , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ers still strive for influence . &quot;
these un@@ changing factors make bas@@ ys mission very difficult .
most requested criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; because the address is unknown , the help of the population is praying and hoped . &quot;
the police in all of Europe are ma@@ iled in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards at dangerous criminals on the run .
&quot; since the addresses of the requested heavy bur@@ gl@@ ars are not known according to nature , references from the population are hoped and praying . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action based on the &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; Adv@@ ent . &quot;
the experiences could have shown that many volati@@ le destinations on holiday destinations were hidden from Euro@@ pol .
you have compiled 21 post@@ cards for selected criminals from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times this website has been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the on @-@ line gestures could be de@@ tained so far , at least 11 of them were posted on the website of the publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aires series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are again confronted with a few more resol@@ ute travelers on the war , which have negotiated one of the town@@ houses , to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous street of Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called &quot; &quot; million@@ aires series &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were released only in May without being fired from one of the advice dig@@ ging tren@@ ches to prevent their accidents . &quot;
the night @-@ full group found a gap in the defense units and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry people have pushed the advice from Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it is &quot; useless &quot; to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabitants said : &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday night after they were sent away from Bentley Heath , where they have thrown stones on the pas@@ sers . &quot;
&quot; the Council must be forced into action by shame , as he was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; travelers were there in May , and are moved back and are now back . &quot;
&quot; more arrived yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to handle , by holding long sub@@ missions to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy , continue to pay my head to pay , if the Council cannot even stop that . &quot;
&quot; a resident who did not want to be called said : &quot; &quot; it is ridiculous we have just seen the last round of these travelers , only to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you even seen a horse in the parking area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman in the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an unauthorized camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ man . we take the necessary legal steps to move it as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to support our mo@@ cking collection , it is very important that as many residents call a anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in police as they call 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the Court must examine , when we present our case . &quot;
from Birken@@ hof - Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ters is currently being renovated and will be opened again on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closing of the Hotel Birken@@ hof by the former ambience of the company mbH , on 13 April 2014 , about 30 000 nights will be lost a year and also income through the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in autumn 2014 , given the rising number of refugees , which came into the district , the hotel building is offered as an umbrella accommodation , which provided the controversial discussion of the quar@@ terly discussions . &quot;
the town prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers through the establishment of a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was then un@@ disputed at that time in the community .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Ober@@ may@@ meister Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location and said at that time of serious prospects in the house .
he should be right .
&quot; the group Lu@@ isen@@ hotels with business leader Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof with a voluntary au@@ ction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of three @-@ star @-@ plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; welcome Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; the former Hotel Birken@@ hof has been in front of the entrance for some time in front of the entrance , and when one enters the house , it becomes clear what extensive renovation works . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ ils were removed out , blankets , partly cut , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
&quot; until March , there is still much to do . &quot;
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black @-@ Black style .
&quot; the rooms are fitted with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are built . &quot;
everything should later be &apos; beautiful &apos; close &apos; as Thomas Sch@@ erer is expressed .
&quot; we want to go out a jewelry @-@ piece , &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , spa area and a meeting room belong to the facilities . &quot;
&quot; it does not want to position at the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ ne , but already on top of an up@@ scale inner level , empha@@ sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its about 60 rooms is set up wide , explains she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; both single vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel at home in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald , and Tourist director Michael Kr@@ ause he has already led . &quot;
the ideas of the city are covered with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; after the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer wants not to set up exactly . &quot;
&quot; less than a million euros , he expects . &quot;
&quot; the outside systems are also transferred to front@@ man , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is open from the restaurant , which is publicly available . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : US @-@ Special releases Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair at U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp , he is supposed to have installed special Grand Jury after a report from Robert Mu@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; the board has recorded work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; under vocation on the matter . &quot;
the paper fle@@ dged the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller is expanding and intensified his inquiries .
the sender CN@@ N reported that there is already first pre@@ amp of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s of oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
US intelligence services acc@@ use the Krem@@ lin for a longer time being specifically mixed up in the presidential campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller investig@@ ates whether there was agreement between Tru@@ mp@@ s Elec@@ tions and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigation , several men are expected to stand in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republican . &quot;
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more Tru@@ mp@@ s priv@@ ately and business environments . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Tru@@ mp Tru@@ mp has moved into the centre for a few weeks , and I &apos;m looking for the repro@@ ach , whether the president may hin@@ dered the judiciary in the course of the affair . &quot;
&quot; the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine and determine present evidence of possible inter@@ ruption , and decide whether accus@@ ation shall be raised . &quot;
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called Acqu@@ itted chambers .
usually they are turned on when it comes to bigger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always done behind closed doors .
the panel can also be turned on by the pro@@ secutor &apos;s office to invite persons to en@@ see under E@@ id .
&quot; according to the CN@@ N , the invitations were already issued , which are about to turn the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
persons who were involved in the meeting were asked for a statement called it in the report .
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; beside Tru@@ mp J@@ r. also Tru@@ mp@@ s consultant and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ner , as well as his dam@@ an election chief Paul Man@@ a@@ fort . &quot;
&quot; right wing spoke on Thursday evening on Thursday evening on Thursday evening , that the suspension show that Mu@@ eller shouldn &apos;t be shy away in his work and that he should be necessary to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; but it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be on the end , in order to decide on the survey of an indictment . &quot;
nevertheless the composition of the committee was the beginning of a new phase in exam@@ inations and a new cause of concern for President Tru@@ mp .
&quot; in the midst of new revelations , the President on Thursday evening ended a speech in West Virginia , to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia &apos;s story is a total invention , &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; the subject give the Democrats a way to feel &quot; &quot; feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; his special consultant T@@ y Cob@@ b declared in an opinion , he doesn &apos;t know anything about the composition of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; but it usually work in secret , he stressed . &quot;
&quot; the White House advocates all measures , who accelerated the work of the Special Off@@ ers in &quot; fair &quot; way . &quot;
the former F@@ BI boss James Com@@ ey said three times that will not be determined against the President .
&quot; one has no reason to accept that something has changed , it was mentioned in the Declaration . &quot;
Mu@@ eller was only used after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey was fired .
&quot; because of this race , accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp had become loud , he had the judiciary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June , ahead of a Senate committee , Tru@@ mp asked him to ask for an adjustment of the inquiries against the former national security advis@@ or Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
the president is under great pressure due to the investigation .
according to the US media portra@@ ys the White House material against the Sonder@@ er@@ mid@@ ler and its employees .
&quot; the ext@@ ingu@@ ished spec@@ ulations about it , whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller is released . &quot;
&quot; unlike an independent special edition of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair at the later President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could be fired theoretically at the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step but bow . &quot;
&quot; two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators stood on Thursday law accus@@ ations , after which the Sonder@@ ator could no longer be released . &quot;
Ant@@ arctic : gigantic ice@@ berg driving in the Ant@@ arctic
&quot; in the West@@ ant@@ arctic , a gigantic ice@@ berg has been solved by the scar@@ c@@ ely size of Berlin by the Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is . &quot;
the divided the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institute for Polar@@ - and marine research on Wednesday .
&quot; the distance over a tri@@ l@@ lion tonnes heavy and 5@@ 800 m @-@ kilom@@ et@@ oss large col@@ oss is now north and will probably be two , three years until he mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; it is located with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , one of the largest ice speakers that researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
a danger for people does not go out of him .
how climate change has played a role in the fall of the ice@@ berg is unclear to research .
&quot; however , there has been a series of unusual inter@@ rup@@ tions in the region for around 30 years , writes the U.S. research centre for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fac@@ tual background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be related to heating . &quot;
the col@@ oss col@@ oss has so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
Sh@@ el@@ fe@@ is s@@ wimm@@ t on the sea and is fed by great gl@@ aciers .
it continues to grow in the sea and breaks up regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the Ant@@ arctic peninsula .
north of this loop was the balance of wa@@ xes and disman@@ tling some years ago .
&quot; a complete shi@@ pper will be there , writes AW@@ I scientist Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; I speak a lot for this , that also the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , because the front can@@ did have never withdrawn as far as it is currently . &quot;
&quot; additionally , the ice plate stand under tension and could dis@@ integrate , if at a key site a piece is early . &quot;
melting away from Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and Eis@@ berg does not increase the sea level since they swimming on the water and pushed ice so much water as it does according to the m@@ elt itself .
&quot; however , the loss of the fe@@ el@@ ism leads to the fact that the gl@@ aciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in the same degree , the British research project writes to observe the Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is according to AW@@ I information with almost 50 000 square kilometers and the fourth largest che@@ el@@ is of the Ant@@ arc@@ tica .
&quot; the transition from the mainland is up to 700 metres thick , in front of the front edge towards the free ocean about 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks out regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural event and no direct connection to climate change is aware , the ice @-@ tag is now in an endangered position , &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most extensive retreat since the beginning of records , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; scientists should be controversial whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is will now grow back in the long term , and possibly collap@@ sed , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even though these researchers fall back to climate change of this gigantic ice@@ berg , so in the past few decades , there are a lot of iron ore of the ant@@ arctic peninsula . &quot;
this long tail of the Ant@@ arc@@ tica covers the direction of South America .
&quot; according to data from the British Ant@@ arctic Survey , the ice surface of the ant@@ arctic peninsula has been reduced by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot;
I contributed to the decline in temperature increases .
the Ant@@ arc@@ tica peninsula has passed over 50 years over the past 50 years and t@@ ame it to the areas where the temperature is at the fastest .
CD@@ U wants to be Hau@@ rigid on the staff
&quot; because it is becoming more and more difficult to occupy free places , the CD@@ U , from the worker association , is to be attractive , in order to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; just shortly before the summer break , the Krem@@ lin 41 new places in administration has been ro@@ bor@@ ns . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the circle administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 appren@@ tices now have their first working day behind .
the teachers in the circle are apparently very popular .
approximately 6@@ 20 applications were presented for the seats available this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle continues to grow to cope with the raised requirements and tasks . &quot;
&quot; currently , there are still 50 not occupied places at the district M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers are sought as well as forces of general public administration . &quot;
the CD@@ U would now like to take the initiative in Kre@@ ist@@ ag with the F@@ DP and U@@ WG and to join the expert in the administration .
&quot; the Administration is to develop a concept for recruitment and recruitment , according to the desire of the parties &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the goal is to cover not only short @-@ term Bed@@ ou@@ ting to professionals , but forward @-@ looking for the applic@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be oriented to the inside and outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ beginners and include a training fee , for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
that sounds already after a good approach .
&quot; because the circle has to do with staff problems , which you did not know earlier . &quot;
other cities adver@@ tise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is from a normal &quot; &quot; contest of public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , a high number of employees , the disease or age can be eliminated from the service . &quot;
&quot; so , the highest time to action so that no more places remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CD@@ U , will go beyond the joint application with his party . &quot;
he had long been standing in the Krem@@ lin for a rot@@ ten surprise when it posed publicly on question and the rest of the parties were ast@@ o@@ unding .
&quot; people want all the possibilities to be checked , which enable an outlet from the municipal work association . &quot;
&quot; if we do not come here in short notice to a satisfactory solution , the county government should seek trade unions - perhaps also in collaboration with the circular towns - a Hau@@ star@@ if , &quot; so peoples . &quot;
&quot; thus , the CD@@ U tries to pay better the employees and officials , when the tari@@ ff of publi@@ city is actually looking for the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , enhanc@@ ements or more money exist only when you move into a higher level that is oriented towards professional years . &quot;
&quot; however , the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years . &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be established in which to take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute protection law . &quot;
&quot; not least by the rising number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele , and Kreis@@ ky Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy exac@@ erb@@ ating the sound to NGO @-@ migrants li@@ f@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has NGOs to use the li@@ f@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea , warned that they may not continue until they stop new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not write a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; &quot; said Interior , Marco Minn@@ ie in an interview with the Tur@@ k daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had contrac@@ ted a boat of the German aid organization , youth Ret@@ re@@ es , because their team effectively worked with traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way which facilit@@ ated illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the aid organization , which has been in operation only for a year , refused to express themselves to detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian pro@@ secutor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Carto@@ sio . &quot;
&quot; for us , the saving of human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; the organization said in an opinion on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can all accus@@ ations , which are currently being raised , only after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had the boat of &apos; youth Ret@@ re@@ es &apos; , super@@ vised by I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that his crew takes the din@@ gh@@ y migrants on board , which can be delivered directly from traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that the smug@@ glers can leave , so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least such an encounter , only 1,3 miles before the Libyan coast took place , according to the pro@@ secutor of the Pro@@ secutor , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected of de@@ cip@@ ating themselves about the authority of the Italian coast , the li@@ f@@ ings in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motiv@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must have an Italian police officer on board that monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been declared to keep in the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules were considered unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring about &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize winner , doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants arrived in Italy in recent weeks , resulting in the last weeks that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast and carried out cooperation with the local citizens . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further discussions with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of reaching Europe . &quot;
gra@@ dients and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ghs bi@@ ker , the &quot; &quot; Berliner out@@ post &quot; &quot; and two motor@@ ists met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region to enjoy four days long and sight@@ se@@ ein@@ gs . &quot;
three free guides were available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
Burg@@ un@@ heim and W@@ einf@@ est von Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led by hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michael &apos;s chapel above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; there was view@@ points , partly to towers , of which one could look far beyond the Pf@@ alz forest and the pre@@ dominant levels . &quot;
&quot; in between , there was again and again long asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ bul@@ ls . &quot;
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and to the People &apos;s festival market .
&quot; again , lookout is at the lookout point , connected by &quot; flo@@ at@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate climb@@ s . &quot;
on the last two days a lot of altitude metres were told .
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and grap@@ ef@@ ts brought welcome breaks . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim at@@ me@@ te the bi@@ ker in the open @-@ air at@@ orio of healing Sole .
even Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
&quot; after 17@@ 3 kilometers and almost 4@@ 500 meters , the group had met the Pf@@ alz forest from its best side - sporty and culturally . &quot;
console instead of law@@ ns - Bundes@@ liga ge@@ ars up for e @-@ sport
are the sports stars in future in front of computer consoles instead of struggling with wind and weather over the stadium to fight ?
&quot; fact : e @-@ sport has long been a serious industry to become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions fans and huge tournaments with high tours included . &quot;
this also recognized the first Bundes@@ lig@@ aver@@ al which are increasingly involved in this field .
&quot; the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded in July a e @-@ sport department and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire a new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says President of Jochen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; it is for sure , that on this train some clubs asc@@ end . &quot;
&quot; the next weekend , the football @-@ associated FIFA World Cup organised in London the first &quot; interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ er of various clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven quali@@ fies . &quot;
also Robin Dut@@ t provides great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advis@@ ing an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 year @-@ old , that young people also go into the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; associations tried to conquer all kinds of markets , especially the Asian . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men , among the contract they could be much more likely to be present in these markets than once a year . &quot;
what is it exactly ?
&quot; in the e @-@ sport computer games like &quot; League Of Le@@ gends , &quot; &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just the football simulation of FIFA at competitive level . &quot;
&quot; long ago , as in normal sports also , le@@ agues are established , in which the pros will compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in the Asian @-@ Asian , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it all about a proper sport ?
&quot; for many , the idea is certainly ordinary . &quot;
even In@@ go F@@ rob@@ atics has long been tac@@ kled with the question .
&quot; the professor at the German Spor@@ ts@@ school in Cologne is E @-@ Sport a sport because he is a competitive and many biological and physical reactions which can be found in the classical sport - for example increased heart rate , stress levels , hormonal changes . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it needs cognitive abilities , a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction ability . &quot;
&quot; professional Gam@@ er should not only exercise at the console , but also to train their body and take care of the diet . &quot;
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; but also problems : &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the scientists empha@@ sizes the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
&quot; players are internationally underway , that is like a big global family , there are no intercultural barriers . &quot;
a study of the corporate coun@@ seling Del@@ o@@ itte and the federal association Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the E @-@ Sport a rapid growth ahead .
&quot; in 2016 that 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ing and large tournaments . &quot;
sales of 130 million are expected to grow in three years .
&quot; against the nearly 2.4 billion euros in the Bundes@@ liga , this is little . &quot;
&quot; however , the e @-@ sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot;

&quot; Michelle Carter , because of the lyrics , the Conrad Roy condem@@ ns for suicide . &quot;
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she has encouraged her friend by texts and calls to suicide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 months of their condemnation behind bars and five years have been exposed on trial . &quot;
Carter was condemned in June for neg@@ ligent killing of Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ tr@@ end@@ able .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free until calling .
&quot; she had been confronted with a penalty of twenty years , but her ordin@@ ance argued that both she and Mr Roy has encountered a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red tro@@ users and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down@@ wards eyes when she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions , Conrad Roy killed , &quot; said the pro@@ secutor of the judgment . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility over it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it has no re@@ mor@@ se shown . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ters attor@@ ney said , it is a &quot; terrible fact that it is completely regre@@ tt@@ able . &quot;
&quot; but judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , did not find out that their &quot; old or Rei@@ f@@ eg@@ rad or even their cl@@ ergy have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
a pro@@ secutor read an explanation of Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy that said there is no day in which I do not mour@@ ning for the loss of my beloved Son .
&quot; I would like that he is proud of me and how I go with everything . I try , despite all my pains that we will carry for eternity with us , for his sisters there , &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said they would never be followed by the knowledge &quot; , &quot; that they will never take part in the wedding of their brother or be an a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; not to have this only person with whom I was together every day since my birth , is a pain that I am always kept with me for the rest of my life . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to place a legal preced@@ ence , since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to commit another suicide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon dioxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle .
&quot; the case passed national attention to himself , after Car@@ ters revealed text releases , that she encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; Hän@@ g you , Spring of a building , former yourself , I do not know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on holiday with his family . &quot;
&quot; look at the eye before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Everything you need to do is turn off the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told that Carter was looking attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; among the few who defended Carter , Amanda Knox , who was condemned in Italy due to murder at her British roomm@@ ate in 2007 before she was released two years ago . &quot;
&quot; released in Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ ber@@ me : learning from the new mini @-@ L@@ ame of FC Bayern
that Joshua k@@ im@@ itate myself as captain for the Audi Cup as a captain .
the FC Bayern tri@@ aut the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner a big season to - Extra motivation is not there .
&quot; something was different in his place in the cabin , which looked Joshua Kim@@ ber@@ me immediately , even if the extra garment was very small , very small . &quot;
&quot; but since far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups of course no Philipp L@@ ame , and no Manuel Neu@@ er to see , he made himself in@@ divided into his arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first use as Bavaria captain . &quot;
well the entry could have been better run than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
&quot; but the character of the coach could tell me too , too . &quot;
&quot; not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen in the youth player , Deb@@ ussy , and just from the holiday of professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a game guide , but he . &quot;
&quot; sugar is distributed by the best to those , to whom you enjoy a lot , which one wants to keep in mood . &quot;
&quot; those who were chosen to commen@@ ce the legacy of Lah@@ m , can use a small extra motivation just fine . &quot;
Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player to take over responsibility .
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old went over the field .
&quot; in the right behind , this is now its position , the white Bin@@ der@@ on arm did its rest . &quot;
and at all Kim@@ ber@@ me took me in this start@@ formation such as the one who can also take advantage of the ru@@ d@@ der in the hand .
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ played trou@@ pe . &quot;
&quot; he had the look for the whole , while many others were busy with themselves . &quot;
&quot; V@@ idal therefore , his missing fitness to play ( fol@@ dable hardly ) ; Renato San@@ ches therefore , on the devil come out of the services of Asia @-@ journey ( fol@@ dable also only conditionally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le with it , not negative to fall in their first appearance in Bavaria tri@@ ko@@ t . &quot;
the whole fol@@ dable quite well .
&quot; beside Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy ran before the brig@@ ade , both ag@@ itated sovereign . &quot;
&quot; the well occupied Nap@@ oli @-@ Sturm often did hard , and even in the building up it was a few times successful . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy was saying that the result , &quot; &quot; not as we had hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; moving , tempo change : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; as usual , these Bayern @-@ Welt is even more accessible to the newcom@@ ers , one saw in connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ dy for example existed in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , not one or two , but determines six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ alla spoke after a few cris@@ p statements on the back of his new fellow @-@ players .
&quot; from there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting sentence , &quot; What &apos;s going on , I have now noticed . &quot;
&quot; with Bavaria , you just have to win any game . &quot;
&quot; after all , this does not necessarily have to teach the new one . &quot;

company satisfied with a Rhin@@ e@@ land @-@ pf@@ alz minister : economy ple@@ ts Wis@@ sings Tempo
&quot; it is often im@@ plac@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as an E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) , is still an economic Minister of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
&quot; this is evident after more than a year , in which the new Economic Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
chambers and companies in the region speak to T V @-@ request of a change in economic policy - and ab@@ ell@@ ations at the same time the old min@@ istri@@ es .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , President of the Association of Tri@@ erer ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing takes the wishes of the economy to the Lem@@ ke all blocked . &quot;
the biggest about @-@ face sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the complete highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and aden@@ au is now at the top of the country .
&quot; again this year , the ministry hopes for a planning process until 2005 the building is to be right . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the West Bank of Trier , which is in the pre @-@ urgent need of the Bundes@@ bolt Plan . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to take operation the route in December 2020 , says Prime Minister of Min@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ us sees a sign@@ post to support regional , but international competitive companies . &quot;
&quot; Trier and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier seeks , as is stimulated by Wis@@ sing , in the wine a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ Label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to create their own company , pra@@ ises the I@@ HK . &quot;
&quot; the Handwerk@@ skammer Trier will see an additional incentive for young trainees , managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; en@@ vis@@ aged is a premium of 1000 Euro for the existed championship and 2500 euros , graduates should make graduates within ten years after the master education . &quot;
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; in the planned road construction , be quick facts to create , at the same time out of the country on the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Managing Director of the I@@ HK Trier . &quot;
&quot; from 56 new engineers , the Wis@@ sing wants to set mobility in the state of mobility , have been occupied so far only 29 places . &quot;
the I@@ HK calls for more orders to external offices .
&quot; CD@@ U @-@ group Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf added to the calculations of the invoice , the country invested in 2017 and by 2018 more than 20 million euros in the preservation of national roads . &quot;
Frank Nat@@ us is also hoping to solve a concept of the country as it wants to solve the skilled workers in the region .
harv@@ ested is also the previous broad@@ band of broad@@ band in the country .
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had only rated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with the note 3.4 . &quot;

&quot; at the moment , ex @-@ Economic Minister of E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is out of politics and is still sitting on the board of wind turbines per wind . &quot;

Audi is intended to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - Aut@@ oh@@ em@@ akers see themselves confronted with a bac@@ kl@@ ash .
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would offer software to update the software in more than 35@@ 0.000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the president &apos;s president said the company is the opinion that &quot; intelligent options are available as restrictions , and related to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to ban or limit . &quot;
&quot; Daimler announced on Tuesday that there are three million Mercedes @-@ cars in Europe , to reduce his diesel emissions . &quot;
none of the companies described companies as re@@ vocation .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the deployment of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but the nitrogen @-@ oxide emissions , the diesel engines , are regarded as car@@ cin@@ ogens and can cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of automotive manufacturers , systems for neutr@@ alization of the diesel vehicles exp@@ elled from diesel vehicles to install , also take what it makes difficult to competitive the price of the cars . &quot;
German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is also charged to ignore the powerful car companies and ignore the signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen to regulate the use of so @-@ called off @-@ age devices to regulate the emissions if a car was tested , but drive on normal passenger conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were accused of Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
last month the former leader of the Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in the motor development of Audi in Germany .
&quot; the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be tried in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal inquiries , after the authorities accused Audi accused a system installed to handle the emissions regulations in Europe and a request that was concentrated on the United States . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could make Volkswagen heavy loads : the luxury car manufacturer is proportional to profit from Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los buttons and the laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was always one of the most published carto@@ ons drawing and the number of characters of his characters are his trademark .
&quot; also with 85 , the Argent@@ ines still draws and works on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; For there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he worked among others as a drawing for bl@@ iss cards - which led him frustr@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when he lost my job , he said once . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris at the end of the &apos; 60s made the breakthrough : with the publication of his Carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artists of cities inspire .
&quot; big , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo pieces cav@@ ort in drawings with the shooting Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning he still sits on the character even today on the drawing , works almost ten hours every day . &quot;
&quot; cal@@ end@@ ars , puzzles , books for small and small , T @-@ Shirts , pl@@ ush animals and watches find his dro@@ oping figures continue to spread much more around the world . &quot;
for six years he has also worked on a cartoon and a TV show with his characters .
&quot; the main person in the movie &quot; &quot; Crazy Island &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los and test@@ es animal in his drawings - that has a thous@@ and@@ fold . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , who will come to the cinema wall . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they say , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the script will not be written by him .
&quot; therefore he looks more on the TV series , which , as its original terms , is produced verb@@ ose . &quot;
laven@@ der threatening to climate change
&quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in the south of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the laven@@ der is due to the drought re@@ mind@@ ing conditions and because of disease @-@ borne insects , resulting in scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great headache . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , Expert of the Agri@@ cultural Research Institute of CR@@ I@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the laven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant in the past years has exposed the effects of climate change that in spring has much less rain and in autumn much more . &quot;
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of laven@@ der .
&quot; there is also a small gyp@@ sum , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that carries the dwarf @-@ c@@ ic@@ adas , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much at stake .
&quot; laven@@ der oil is not only looking for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also highly appreciated for perf@@ umes and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; said Eric Cha@@ isse : &quot; instead of having very long crop protection with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; so , we have less parts with etheric oil . &quot;
&quot; among the solutions that are considered , include a better water distribution and slow@@ ing down the ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also the audi@@ ting of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought . &quot;

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the Weekly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce will normally meet in order to review their plans for the latest chaos in the state Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt civil servants and unc@@ easing drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about safety . &quot;
&quot; it has been told to them , that it is important to change their routines . &quot;
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what is more confident about : they should take their children to the office , who were in 2009 the target of an attack with shells , or they will be at home . &quot;
&quot; safety experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room : ad@@ versaries , neutral , ally . &quot;
&quot; ask the re@@ porter to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , percep@@ tions and abs . &quot;
&quot; there are drug smug@@ glers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists , who are suspected of standing on the sal@@ aries of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico . &quot;
&quot; there is no rest of violence , and throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses are common there are more and more journalists at the same time : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to took office in December 2012 , and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven states . &quot;
&quot; among the latter are the editors and their inspiration from Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist , Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence is perceived deeply , although its presence is present everywhere - a great photo of Val@@ dez , which shows its mid @-@ finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs at the faç@@ ade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce @-@ building . two re@@ porters in the 1930 &apos;s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ ani@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , its night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although 2010 was established a son@@ ant federal government in order to process the cases of journalists , it adopted according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with most of the thousands of kill@@ ings , which are linked every year with drug trading and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists will rarely be judged . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce still they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ tr@@ apped and although the terrain is now still tra@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; without any information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for discussion of security has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very silly to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know the Why , we trust everyone . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he made it just to drive a few blocks away , before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably due to the name of the newspaper - who is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ fter &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius took away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a wife and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans arrest in the past year and the delivery in the United States in January was Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t slaughter fields of the country , since rival@@ ing groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it makes nothing that in Sin@@ alo@@ a each day someone or several people are shot down on the road or that the cemetery is full of tw@@ isted , two @-@ story maus@@ ole@@ ums for drug users who are larger than many houses for the living . &quot;
&quot; forget for a minute , that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only a Kart@@ ell has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs merchandise in the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , was broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February the publication of an interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival@@ ing cases of anti@@ trust in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans children . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed gang@@ on@@ members bought any copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was not to force Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another paper that had published the same story , leaving the country to his own safety . &quot;
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad and its killing will be regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues instruc@@ ted that he would always be there .
he was engaged as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este when he joined together with five colleagues for the founding of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journalism without encounter@@ ing the rob@@ bed problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with time , the paper served a reputation because of courageous and honest coverage , and the sales and the promotion took place . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porters loved it to publish hard @-@ going studies without fear of cens@@ orship , and the reader were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else would treat . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the creation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ C@@ abo@@ t @-@ Prize &quot; &quot; for her coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history , wherever they lead . &quot;
he voluntarily gave up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue living , &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug trading in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
you will need to take over the task that you want as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ?
&quot; the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce @-@ team missed Val@@ dez , the Spa@@ ak @-@ bird , who was like a do@@ ck@@ workers , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
you trust his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Man@@ at@@ í , the bar opposite the office , go and sit there at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now , they ask , was his love for the routine of his destruction ? &quot;
his death also has forced her to ask her own assu@@ mptions about how they can do their work best and stay alive .
&quot; they do not like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home starting points and landing ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
&quot; if it smells wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; anger is said the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; odor is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing happens with Javier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are not in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as not as in Tam@@ ar@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which a po@@ ison@@ ous blend of lu@@ cr@@ ative smug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials . &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; in the room where the employees of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for safety training , there were suddenly no cell@@ phones allowed . days before has been known that Spy@@ ware issued exclusively to governments , to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot;
they were asked by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a middle class quarter of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the jo@@ z , some of the re@@ porters asked whether this officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen who signed the governor itself as not trustworthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the re@@ porters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs were de facto under control . &quot;
for the issue of this week Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has been li@@ cked on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former known box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the state spending on the home town of Govern@@ ors concentrated .
&quot; there was a group that was in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , one block from the office of the citizen , a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ porter learned from public records , that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy leader that reigned over the whole century all political levels . &quot;
recently several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ level cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about the previous incidents in this e@@ at@@ ery including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went to a military attack .
&quot; only a few months earlier , the reader had seen the column of Val@@ dez , as the best informed source about the kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; sooner we had already knew what happened , &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; because of its slim body creation . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez has been dedicated to storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers to protest against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the employees have become something they had never anticipated : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
re@@ porter Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez sn@@ apped a few signs and went up next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the Pro@@ secutor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ded disappeared three days after Val@@ dez , had been killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; a burnt body was discovered and officials , based on DNA tests that it is . &quot;
&quot; journalists in the whole country have become a statement of journalists , by establishing them in organised protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on salary and buildings . &quot;
&quot; this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to send journalists to journalists and make them change the truth . &quot;
&quot; since then , it has not been asked that the government is divided again by the government , because it is worried that their rage has viol@@ ated their objectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez repeatedly had said that journalists in Mexico was surrounded by organised crime , involved with government officials and a uniform society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters are not only killed by drug subjects , but also on the orders of politicians and security guards who were under organised crime under a blan@@ ket . &quot;
&quot; the Media @-@ W@@ äch@@ ter@@ group &quot; &quot; Artic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; took more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials in the past year . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico do you die because they want you to the mouth , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot;
obviously the kill@@ ings have a de@@ terr@@ ent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; your body was found together with a note that was said to be signed by Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell , &quot; Here am I for my reports . &quot;
a computer@@ ized and head@@ phones were in addition to their separate head .
&quot; some branches elected as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua , after the murder of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March . &quot;
others on how it did El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assass@@ ination of its director in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez built publicly on the drug cart@@ els with an editorial page on the title page &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their own countries or even out of the country .
it is a painful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
&quot; and sometimes , they are hun@@ ted as evi@@ dently were murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City , three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who continue to stay and continue working , it is a daily dance with risky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , gives to that the drug trading is scar@@ ed him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico is going to hell , and so I was re@@ porters , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat down on the side@@ walk in front of the office and tran@@ ce beer , when all their phones started . &quot;
a series of sho@@ ots with Band@@ ora and security guards in the vicinity of the bath@@ ed Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ate on how it was promised by a series of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
from the on @-@ board edge you have released the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce on mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ enen he@@ ul@@ ts nearby - another shooting in the area .
&quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen , the guards stopped to see if they were in willingness . &quot;
&quot; if they were afraid , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the powerful portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle @-@ finger was visible for the whole Sin@@ alo@@ a , the employees of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed its tracks . &quot;
&quot; how can you just think of thinking , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; if the same day was murdered by Javier , the train@@ ee ask me to send it to the road to the road . &quot;
dinosau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to so@@ ften his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue when a fri@@ ghtening .
&quot; now , researchers have found that the first knowledge of the unbelievable rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian Mountain@@ eer were so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was so well preserved that they could even find that his shoe skin was of red@@ dish , and they said they could have had something from a &quot; &quot; uncomfortable past . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Cur@@ rent Biology , &quot; described him as &quot; the bes@@ ter@@ ned dinosau@@ rs that was ever found , and one of the best dinosau@@ rs copies of the world . &quot;
&quot; Fossi@@ l is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , which lived in the middle of the Cre@@ t@@ ace@@ ous period of between 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot;
&quot; its incredibly well preser@@ v@@ ative condition has researchers , which to describe it as &quot; truly remarkable &quot; fl@@ ab@@ ber@@ gast@@ ed &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic is the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ ater that is best preserved Fossi@@ l of its kind .
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn funk , when he was in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the North of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he looked at something which appeared from the surrounding rocks out of the board , and decided to see more accurately . &quot;
the fossil discovered that was sent to the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to expose the wild animals within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy geography . &quot;
after all these hard work the finished product is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you &apos;re just a little with the eyes blind , you could almost believe that it has slept &quot; , &quot; said the Haupt@@ au@@ tor Cal@@ eb Brown , scientists at the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum where the creature has to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it will enter the history of scientists as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosau@@ rs copies , Mon@@ a Lisa is the dinosau@@ r . &quot;
researchers have found that this crop @-@ e@@ ater although it is covered with an arm@@ or and resembles a changing arm@@ or is likely to be threatened by meat .
&quot; the heavily ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding that is known as counter @-@ ageing , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have been allowed to blend into its environment and so@@ ften their enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs made the head@@ lines in May and is now at the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ et@@ elli according to the museum techniques Mark Mitchell , one of a team who has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to discover it carefully . &quot;
the amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for the Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
&quot; they discovered the counter@@ sha@@ ding , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the peak of the creature was darker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the lock@@ smith is usual , the results are surprising , because the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it points out that the dinosau@@ rs has been ch@@ ased by enough pressure through meat @-@ eating dinosau@@ rs , that evolution encourages the exploitation of the confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most of the contemporary animals that put the counter sha@@ ding - think of deer , Zeb@@ ras or G@@ ür@@ tel@@ es - are much smaller and hur@@ t@@ less than loot , which signal that these No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; powerful predat@@ ory behaviour on a massive , heavily ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs , how dangerous the dinosau@@ rs carni@@ vor@@ es of the Cre@@ t@@ ace@@ ous must have been &quot; , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
chemical analysis organ@@ ic compounds in their skins shows also that the skin of the dinosau@@ r is bay .
&quot; scientists continue to study the animal on information about his life , including its fourth Dar@@ min@@ tes in order to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the dinosau@@ rs , when he died , driven into a river and driven out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea floor . &quot;
&quot; at that time Alberta was so warm as South fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are probably much more widespread than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is fully covered with preser@@ v@@ aged skin , but also retained in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the beast , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost as it is in the early chal@@ k .
&quot; you do not need much imagination to use to re@@ construct it . if you just have a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is alive . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k @-@ time was a time when giant Ther@@ opo@@ ds , carni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ r , which stood on two legs , the earth crossed . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta lived , the ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his fur@@ tive ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the Fach@@ magazine Cur@@ rent Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta has failed after death in the sea and in mud m@@ um@@ i@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn funk , when he was in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the North of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum it is the bes@@ ter@@ ned dinosau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
the creatures were about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have wei@@ gh@@ ed up to 3.000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long spi@@ kes that rest@@ ores from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es was curved by the Western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded into the open sea .
but the underwater of the dinosau@@ r preserved its arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the hidden remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains are still b@@ umpy plates along the dinosau@@ r
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as &apos; rare as a profit in lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it , the mess it becomes . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin , still cover the b@@ umpy plates that carry the skull of the beast . &quot;
&quot; his right front @-@ base is on his side , his five fingers are up to the top . &quot;
I can count the scales on his sole .
in the storm : Mass@@ ar@@ aram@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
fierce accident on Thursday night on Thursday night at the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass @-@ Aram@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous verses , kilom@@ et@@ re long run - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) on the late Thursday afternoon at a mass @-@ Aram@@ bol@@ age about 20 people have been injured .
&quot; after the first information of the police were at 17@@ .00 hrs between the shareholders of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district Ai@@ ch@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm almost 30 vehicles , including probably lor@@ ries , inter@@ connected . &quot;
&quot; beyond the exact number of the publishers , there is no information available . &quot;
&quot; it was mild to medium @-@ severe injury , said a poli@@ ze@@ g . &quot;
a large ban on rescue vehicles was at the accident point .
the A@@ 8 was completely locked in direction to Munich .
in the Munich city of Munich there was a couple of ten kilometres long back .
&quot; as an AZ @-@ re@@ porter reports , it also came up on the bac@@ kl@@ ink to massive disabilities - through numerous g@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the fire @-@ fire not@@ ated the mark of the vehicle , who have now reck@@ oned with sensitive sentences . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 , then there was a second accident at the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a collision between a cart@@ ran@@ sport and a car .
a rescue @-@ helicopter was on the road to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : Group test@@ et &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once again : nothing has been sitting in the train and sleeps .
or you are deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the she@@ ath@@ ner and awak@@ ens a uns@@ elling or irrit@@ ates the driver in the middle of the work@@ flow .
ticket control .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn currently has the managed ticket control .
&quot; it is simply confirmed by phone , that you have taken his place and is used for the ticket . &quot;
currently a test operation runs on two routes .
&quot; when the offer comes , we wide range of it . &quot;
&quot; it will then be available in Germany at the beginning of next year in Germany , &quot; &quot; said a train speaker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; is the train for the driver &apos;s driver with no creation . &quot;
&quot; to use the use , however some requirements must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - which is anyway already the most passengers .
&quot; you have to also have bought it via the App , the DB Navigator software , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking . &quot;
and finally you need a seat reservation .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works so : one climb@@ s in the train , calls his ticket under &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the test customers will then be a button for electronic de@@ valuation .
the draw@@ backs get on their mobile devices a message that Fahr@@ g@@ ast X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
&quot; comes the train manager at the ticket control to No. Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already registered online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , keep silent . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn is to use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; if you want to relaxed without ticket control by our train , check in the DB navig@@ ator simply yourself . &quot;
&quot; this enables the guests to design their travel time in the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Board of DB remote traffic . &quot;
&quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to address the individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who often drives train , knows that in addition to delays and pass@@ able moves the ticket controls to the biggest gri@@ ev@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; because often , one does not have any documents in any case , but not all the documents you need for the de@@ valuation of on @-@ line tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the ID card is missing or otherwise a document that one has to imagine .
the result are endless discussions between Zug@@ verhalten and passenger who leads to poor mood in the part or large @-@ room and delays in control of your own ticket and takes responsibility at the end of time to take care of other matters .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
&quot; and that &apos;s just on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen . &quot;
other train numbers on the same track are not yet un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Britt@@ any Fer@@ rell was shaken to its core .
&quot; just one day after she arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis born in the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on her phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the street , &quot; was there . &quot;
&quot; confused as no one else on her feed had posted the information , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly saved on her tim@@ eline .
&quot; the R@@ apper from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white poli@@ cem@@ an in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot;
&quot; he po@@ ised a picture of navig@@ ating le@@ blo@@ ous body , which was stretched on the road and would stay there four hours . &quot;
&quot; it is wild , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell . &quot;
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she placed her mobile phone to return later on the evening to twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and the people , the sh@@ out , and of a man who claimed that his father said to be a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they observed a live Feed where a poli@@ cem@@ an is in front of a group of protesters with a dog bar@@ king .
&quot; in another video , she said , she assured another poli@@ cem@@ an his rif@@ le and cried , &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill you . &quot;
&quot; that is not usual , &quot; Fer@@ rell reminds of her testimony . &quot;
that is not the kind of murder that we have accu@@ stom@@ ed to and which we can call a typical one .
in this moment I felt ch@@ ills .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
you booked a flight back and went home the next day .
&quot; after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; , &quot; in the cinemas from the 11th hour . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , of strength and resistance , which consists of the perspective of people living in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who took a flower @-@ dress and a suitable crown , went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , pra@@ ises the two a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for that , what they believe in ? &quot; she reminded of what she said . &quot;
we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police had killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right .
&quot; I could not take her , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
that which is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know and will see it and be put up in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do is free to liber@@ ate ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have luck to give her an experience in which they personally have no ek@@ ee@@ pers racism , it is no different from the next black women . &quot;
&quot; I feel I would show you a bad service , to keep away from it . &quot;
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authorities , which became a Camp@@ site as the activists on the possible non @-@ indictment by Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; in there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter had joined with a local business partner . &quot;
they prepared bags in front of and helped to pass them on protesters .
slowly began to accept a new type of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rell .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed totally after 9 August , &quot; &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority student Nur@@ ses Association and concentrated on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in Organ@@ ize .
it is all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell met during an evening @-@ demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the Co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an said her and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to document &quot; document &quot; what happened .
&quot; a question came from Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can exploit ? &quot;
&quot; these scep@@ ticism has been nour@@ ished by countless cases of men , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benef@@ ited from her pain and its resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently declared : &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , and did not want to have their voices centered and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had worked together with the former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field , known for his activ@@ ism rum in To@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt occup@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought the project closer together , together with six other indigenous peoples followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak , &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are presented , as I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ells &apos; experience - to show that it is not about a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious student in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ is life , as she loves herself and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I have understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability at this work and in humanity .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ y@@ ells history repeated the role of black gay women in the broader black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which after killing the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; in social media , identify themselves as sul@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in management positions have borne the movement in total , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must carry the main last of everything . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women .
&quot; however , it is obvious that &quot; &quot; this is not a affir@@ mati@@ ver type of action &quot; , &quot; when Fer@@ rell was chosen as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who took this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no coincidence , even though she was on the front line because with a life on these crosses as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen .
&quot; in the meantime , the news cameras arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on long ago , but the racial links between the church and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is on currency for 2 ½ years because of the block@@ age of a highway in a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; a mess . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they cl@@ ed to a song and she feels obliged to this memory , since three years ago she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on on the road three years ago . &quot;
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; me@@ gal@@ ahn &quot; : TV readers talk about bit @-@ gallery
the bit @-@ gallery moves the people even though it is not yet built for a long time .
but the idea of a mall at the south end of the pedestrian street spl@@ its since the first presentation of 2009 the population in pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents .
&quot; cold , the subject hardly leaves one . &quot;
on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; the topic will be discussed .
&quot; while one can say to the Bit Gallery , &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; that would be really great &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side , &quot; &quot; no human &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi Bet@@ ts ) or simply simply : &quot; &quot; me@@ gal@@ om@@ ania &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while the advocates build that a gallery moves more customers into the city , of which the rest of the business will benefit , fear the enemies that then the pedestrian street ble@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery will be built exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall stands in which 13 direct mark@@ eter products offer their products . &quot;
the construction work will be concluded with the start of construction work .
&quot; the gallery m@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building , namely to the Bed@@ a place , with a way to sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; Simone Room : &quot; &quot; we have been driving almost every week in the peasant market for many years . &quot;
&quot; mostly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the landscape are always very happy . &quot;
even the but@@ cher we have discovered for us .
&quot; we would desire that even during and above all after building the gallery , there is an opportunity to maintain this offer . &quot;
in other cities there is also this .
the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ d D@@ ensing : &quot; &quot; whether the mar@@ ke@@ ters market in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the height of the rent . &quot;
&quot; however , this might not be very low in the new project . &quot;
Eva Kili@@ c : &quot; why the Commercial Palace in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find that superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there are already enough in our city .
you see how many charges are empty here - some since months and years .
&quot; however , since there is not even a neat weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the Mark@@ thalle will remain intact . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there is fresh , mostly offered by the manufacturer and is very inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you see , cargo will be rented in a shopping center only by larger firms , because the local tenants are often not viable for a retailer . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special stores there are almost no more and what still exists , then will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a mall with a Mark@@ thalle that doesn &apos;t fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit into Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmers market place during the construction period ?
&quot; the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even at the duration , if the bit gallery will actually come . &quot;
or does it create the spec@@ ter bit gallery already to drive all shops from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that &apos;s just not going to work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which is empty , also no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion it would have been better to promote the right farmer &apos;s market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a peasant hall , it is thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg have no place anymore . &quot;
&quot; when the peasant market is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
an appropriate similarity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces see - white , black and brown , which are almost in@@ conspic@@ uous - that hang on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the 30 portraits were made by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and Haar@@ lem , which were sent to her by Chelsea M@@ anning . &quot;
&quot; M@@ anning sent the excerpts from the prison of Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth where the former Secret Services analy@@ st gave birth to a 35 @-@ year prison sentence , after it publicly tra@@ iled diplomatic reports about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , A Bec@@ oming resem@@ blan@@ ce ( A suitable similarity ) . &quot;
&quot; it is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united its expertise in technology , computer sciences and art , and M@@ anning , a trans@@ woman and pione@@ ering dis@@ ed , whose condemnation of Barack Obama had been transformed when he had only three days in his ministry . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been extracted from the algorithm analysis of DNA , which could be extracted from M@@ anning , and created out of the 30 portraits , such as someone with these genom@@ ic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted , and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations , but also to identity . &quot;
&quot; M@@ anning , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has been openly manifest@@ ed since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced in 2013 because of 20 accus@@ ations , including six violations against the sp@@ y law , computer and theft . &quot;
&quot; through the prison its image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one single photo - a gran@@ ny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which M@@ anning sits on an elevator and a plat@@ onic blonde carries out with which she was associated . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 @-@ project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
&quot; it produced the artist portraits of strangers from for@@ ens@@ ory arti@@ facts such as ci@@ ble bl@@ acks and che@@ wing g@@ um , making the DNA extracted from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like . &quot;
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press show of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not be visited at that time , and she could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
the artist and her prisoners were received at an un@@ equal pen@@ pal who brought several letters over the course of two years .
&quot; they even created some of the Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ungo illustrated com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ressed images , &quot; which would pre@@ dict a future in which the president would convert Chel@@ able verdi@@ ct and could be able to see the exhibition in person . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings had been calling for seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome way of happy meeting . &quot;
&quot; there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong , since Donald Tru@@ mp leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the governmental camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to fix the rigid spl@@ its that he should actually fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen out of a particular reason . &quot;
&quot; in one on the wall of the gallery the artistic statement called M@@ anning with its super@@ large signature , among them ( the &quot; i &quot; in their family name ) is an end to &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis gender , race , sexuality and culture have been . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , its mitochondri@@ al DNA sequence is a thous@@ and@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As , in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the involvement of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ de after the highly developed scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) , as is astonishing , at least in biological terms , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully bring about it is that our genome does not take care of who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective it is , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , too . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in its own room , is a page from the above mentioned comic @-@ Nov@@ elle . &quot;
&quot; it shows M@@ anning , as it appears with a free pre@@ cht@@ el@@ ef@@ on in the hand of the discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ cades of the United States such as King Kong . &quot;
&quot; when they say your speech , then they won . &quot;
&quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter whom she wrote me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who greeted me from Philadelphia . &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ ose , when I talk about it . &quot;
&quot; M@@ anning has not yet seen the exhibition - as it pres@@ upp@@ lied in the comic book - but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the center of space of masks , from their own genom@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ tion@@ ists that gather as hor@@ des of protesters . &quot;
&quot; this was also pur@@ pose@@ ful , as everything was written in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) &quot; in which their genetic Hap@@ il@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement , who formed with Chelsea , like the movement that also stuck behind her liberation . &quot;
&quot; Professor of the University of North@@ western , and an employee of the University of Oxford because of killing &quot;
&quot; a vast majority of human hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University , and an employee of the University of Oxford , who were looking for susp@@ ects after a man in a luxury apartment in Chicago had been enriched with deadly injuries . &quot;
on Monday were issued for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) Ar@@ rest War@@ rant because of murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Cor@@ nell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au .
&quot; the documents say that Cor@@ nell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several stit@@ ches died . &quot;
one of the police authorities published by Chicago published public warning system says that the body was discovered on 27 July .
officials received a call from the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body .
&quot; Cor@@ nell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au still declared the place of the event for dead , and det@@ ectives examine the stit@@ ch as murder , while the police are active after the two susp@@ ects said officials . &quot;
La@@ them has been a professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cu@@ b@@ bage , Vice President for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them@@ self should now be excluded in absence and excluded from the entered campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a stra@@ it@@ ous issue that is studied by the competent authorities , and North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; said Cu@@ b@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ man of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and willing to help U.S. investig@@ ators in any imagin@@ able manner .
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were shocked and we want it to be .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he asks the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have a conception of their location , and our efforts to loc@@ alize it , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza @-@ building , who had just received a pu@@ zz@@ ling tip , said that in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , it was unclear whether the incident occurred on 27 July . &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation of the residents : &quot; the police currently works at the time axis and the background of the sacri@@ ficial and explored a variety of motives including a possible domestic incident .
&quot; we will conclude the W@@ ada @-@ Roadmap in the near future &quot; - the Russian Vice @-@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
&quot; the Russian Vice @-@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said , it won &apos;t take long until the remaining criteria of the world @-@ anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( W@@ ada ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) . &quot;
&quot; in a specific stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ ada @-@ Roadmap was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; says Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented the second part of the road@@ map of W@@ ada to observe the code , which describes the criteria for re @-@ use R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organisation . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything for Russia to concern concern . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ Dop@@ ing authorities must accept the reported results of the Russian attor@@ ney Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren in alleged state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in the Russian sport . &quot;
&quot; in regards to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation into being our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there was no state programmes , and we will not admit that which does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ kos words coinci@@ ded with those of Vit@@ aly S@@ mir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with Russian sales office R@@ sport at the beginning of the day , S@@ mir@@ nov encountered problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ Dop@@ ing organisations , but then added : &quot; we repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has before to accept this report un@@ conditionally , &quot; S@@ mir@@ nov added . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of the dop@@ ing Sk@@ and@@ als from the W@@ ada out of the implementation of dop@@ ing controlled in Russia .
&quot; however , you have been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; following a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ ada @-@ General director Olivier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved to &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di does not sell eggs any more
this divided the company groups .
&quot; it hand@@ es to be a pure precaution , it could not be assumed from any health impairment , it was in the communication . &quot;
&quot; as of now , only eggs are supplied to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ hal@@ ted anti @-@ le@@ ases . &quot;
Al@@ di wants to make clarity and transparency for its customers .
&quot; start @-@ ups that will help your company , not to become the next U@@ ber &quot;
Amy Savi@@ t wanted to measure the happiness at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the surveys did not work .
&quot; answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful , or worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you spoke anonym@@ ity , some workers did not mour@@ ning for the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objectivity , &quot; said Savi@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has been called from outside for help .
&quot; a new race of human resources start @-@ ups is at the wa@@ xing , to help companies find out how their employees feel . &quot;
&quot; creating and licens@@ ing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee &apos;s commitment allows them to address surveys , speci@@ ality groups and demo@@ graphic groups , employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers permit executives to deal and turn right to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; &quot; Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools used by companies to measure commitment . &quot;
&quot; she said she has better insight into what your employees think , and won over the three years with G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the s@@ nap surveys and surveys from certain teams , it offers a heat @-@ card of the company that indicates a glance which units have most complaints and which executives may have low additives results - so that you can drilling low yiel@@ ding results . &quot;
&quot; companies are coming to see that at the top of the workplace culture , you will not have to be involved in sc@@ and@@ als who have been published in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post in which those who have spoken , have been pen@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this desire for an overview is an lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have increased by 2020 more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion , after the finance @-@ technical website Let &apos;s talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent de@@ vised behavior and recognize , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles at Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
information has recently registered as a client .
&quot; how G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ ting Conver@@ cent companies custom @-@ made &quot; &quot; pul@@ ls &quot; &quot; to send sensitive answers in real time and view the warmth @-@ cards of your problem areas . &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS @-@ hot@@ line with the employee to report a bad behavior .
&quot; and if the managing director is involved , complaints directly on the Supervis@@ ory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has recorded the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that its staff can be badly treated or beha@@ ved in@@ eth@@ ically , it may be costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cott , workers @-@ fluctu@@ ation and chambers , &quot; said Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has conver@@ cent for more than a year to make sure that employees are aware of politics and processes and have an easy way to achieve their corporate central . &quot;
&quot; sooner if a employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a intimid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good way to follow the complaints from employees . &quot;
&quot; now , since the company conver@@ cent supports , problems that were previously un@@ conce@@ aled in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or irregular internship . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment law disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; companies began to take ethics , values and employees in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Andersen because of eth@@ ic distor@@ tion collap@@ sed by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; but it took , until the &quot; Social Media to their right &quot; came to recognize that companies knew that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and loads the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products . &quot;
&quot; it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital investors , which have supported both start @-@ ups . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ cent received $ 10 million at funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , which has raised the entire capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
gl@@ itz@@ ers assured $ 10 million in November by Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners and brought its entire financing to $ 60 million .
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and Venture Capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees expect to expect more jobs than previously . &quot;
competitive markets such as Sili@@ con Valley are high salary and interesting projects only in@@ serts .
employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you can give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that has heard their voices , and that the work that you do to do is worthwhile , then Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , used both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors reach Ren@@ dering when their portfolio companies run well . businesses will work well if employees are involved and engaged .
&quot; when the analytics tools promise from third parties to increase commitment and use of the employees , it is no wonder that you find assistance . &quot;
the data on the employee &apos;s commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the car@@ et@@ aker of a company does not take action .
&quot; in fact , when a company asks for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , this can grow dis@@ appointments and employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting in the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company focusing on the collecting of data . &quot;
&quot; for if you are not followed by staff , &quot; &quot; Do you really hear me ? &quot;
do you take care of that ?
and who you cannot take care of why should I ?
&quot; Madison Re@@ ed , who now performs the monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem over G@@ lin@@ t is reported so deliver@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated staff , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company by the speed of decision making and the quality of communication , capable of organizing several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; on Ruby Tuesday , the company always gets new insights on the staff , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better binding of workers in a industry that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose man , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose them . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A remo@@ ves the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it goes on 23 o &apos;clock as a lot of U@@ CL@@ A @-@ Foot@@ ball@@ player on one side of the new exercise fields of the team are maintained at the campus .
some have moved their tri@@ cot@@ t@@ oms and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team they represent a lunch break .
&quot; players who are registered to the summer cur@@ ses will return after the three @-@ hour practice to their dis@@ closing examination , before they return next morning at 6 : 30 to the water@@ man Football Center . &quot;
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real tre@@ ad@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday to Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminated two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the burden of players , and she has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ CL@@ A should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already fully @-@ packed tim@@ et@@ ables of the players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise reached from the two days is more than one day , at which the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times in West wood practical exercises . &quot;
they should hold 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the beginning of the formal game preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude against Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he support the rules of the N@@ CA@@ A support , even if they add a further point in the busy routes of the player . &quot;
&quot; we put this tremendous burden to three or four days on them , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they have pushed it through , they plac@@ ent themselves further , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come up to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practices as soon as the Camp is finished , what has been raised in the light of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that is already covered with foot@@ balls , which is already an easy task . &quot;
&quot; brood @-@ players are to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a sp@@ ects that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people can rent a room there and then set up an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the vide@@ ot@@ and of an exercise , it is a pretty good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces in parking 8 . &quot;
&quot; we will do the best , with what we have . &quot;
I am not doing so too much concerned .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against fake messages
&quot; Facebook intends to send more potential articles with false messages from third parties and see their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News . &quot;
the company told us in an opinion on his website that it will begin with the use of updated mechanical learning methods to see possible mis@@ cellaneous messages and to display them in fact test that may display the results of the fact check out of the original article .
Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the main points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News . many of them believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections 2016 .
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with false stories were floo@@ ded in May with false stories , and Germany will support a plan , after which social media networks will be punished if they do not succeed to eradi@@ cate Post@@ ings like before the elections in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Facebook said Facebook in a separate statement in German , that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany will start a test of the new facts review . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the knowledge that stories of fact @-@ audi@@ ted parties will be challenged , people want more context to meet in @-@ depth decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; said Sara Su , Product man@@ ag@@ erin for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook continues to be his feature to the &quot; &quot; related articles &quot; &quot; and works on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages . &quot;
creating a comic @-@ novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze music video and was a lo@@ oph@@ ole for Margaret T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ er and 1980 @-@ s .
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has witnessed 700 years of turbulent history within the Be@@ w@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent , and is now the inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mop@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript by someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says we@@ ary . &quot;
what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; embr@@ aces the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who were illustrated in Scot@@ ney - Isaac L@@ enk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he un@@ expect@@ edly found emotion@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; I have only responded to the thum@@ b imprint on the side of a letter , which was written by a double @-@ agent in the 1700 @-@ s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thum@@ b print ! &quot;
&quot; and they always smell smoke , because at that time there is a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself also were there . &quot;
&quot; Ah , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who was so struck with old papers , he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have a little over@@ valued &quot; ) this all seems to be true in order to be true . &quot;
Rhodes spent his days to explore the Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ bund &quot; new &quot; castle to study the archives and to study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle as well as the extinct hy@@ ena heads at the walls and the bottles that have been centuries in the tren@@ ches .
&quot; he emig@@ rated by the land and ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landscape @-@ par@@ ities , gar@@ dener and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key and started to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust was only received full access in 2006 when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; as Rhodes was later met a decade later , the employees started to take care of the archive , which he said than &quot; hundreds of years , in which aristocr@@ ats said &quot; &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , cards that represent what he possessed : &quot; &quot; one could mean that Land@@ conflict would be boring , &quot; &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let all go his gear ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se in the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who built the newly built castle in order to join the farmer @-@ up of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a upheav@@ al that occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book titled &apos; Kni@@ fe of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rhodes . &quot;
the farmer was started in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start .
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it patent in the history of Dar@@ rell seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; &apos; The S@@ mug@@ gler &apos; , represented in which the smug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell was represented in the 18th century by consecr@@ ated a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was taken until years later than its coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed quite convenient to be taking debt and spend money for things that they could not afford .
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men swe@@ eping their school crises by holding rich old women , I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking boys , with a talent to adver@@ tise brass . &quot;
after the end of his use at the castle Rhodes is looking for another unique scre@@ am experience
&quot; it has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic @-@ novel about E@@ paraly@@ sis , the terrain of a san@@ atorium dating back to the early 20th century , which has since been restored by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; it was like that , &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ ak@@ ap@@ elle vei@@ led in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the disclosure of the 301 years old Mari@@ ak@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honnef on Friday launched her campaign to introduce a new brand name ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep the logo and slogan secret by Nelson Ar@@ tz . &quot;
at the end of August there is to be a highlight of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? , ask the makers of action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , write them on their yesterday activated website . &quot;
&quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention .
&quot; and to make it clear , that it is better than it seems . &quot;
basically we are firmly convinced that we know as the Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizen to appreciate the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well .
&quot; in action it is more than &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it is called on . &quot;
&quot; it is a common promise to form@@ ulate one , which gives the city an unmistak@@ able single choice . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in the competition with other municipalities . &quot;
a middle five @-@ dig@@ it amount can be found in the city of Bad Honnef its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reform in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan fear of the army
&quot; every year at the beginning of August , in Ankara the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) on pen@@ sion@@ ings and promotions in the officer . &quot;
so also this week .
at first glance a normal operation .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish forces a year after the coup .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of the Staff , as in the former headquarters of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; the proceedings were elected by the heads of government under the presidency of the government as well as the ministers for defense , home affairs , justice and foreign office . &quot;
thus civilians in the Y@@ as were in the over@@ number .
the government draws the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; chief executive of Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar will remain in office , but the commander of the army , the aer@@ on@@ ists and the Navy were cancelled . &quot;
&quot; since the failed Cou@@ p leader , President Erdo@@ gan developed 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the ex@@ iled Pre@@ acher &apos;s Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erdo@@ gan as a wire attempt of the coup . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 people who have been involved directly at the coup attempt , this week has been in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; even on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had described the overthrow of a &quot; &quot; God &apos;s gift , &quot; &quot; as he gives him the opportunity to clean the armed forces . &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have under control ?
in the end of February the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ eas@@ gen in the Military @-@ headquarters . &quot;
&quot; the general public concerns it concerns about the increasing &quot; Islam@@ i@@ fication &quot; of the army , manifest@@ ed among others in the abolition of the head@@ sc@@ arf ban for sol@@ dat@@ ors , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
the big event in the army and the safety councils are at any rate further .
&quot; in the middle of July Erdo@@ gan left by decre@@ e further 7@@ 3@@ 95 , including 2@@ 303 police officers and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed as did Erdo@@ gan w@@ ned the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly known as the actual masters of the country .
&quot; three times , it filed under vocation to their role as a gu@@ ardian of the secular state . &quot;
&quot; after his election victory in 2002 Erdo@@ gan pressed the power of the military step by step , not least under vocation to the reform of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan driving forward a Islam@@ i@@ fication of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; , &quot; a particularly so @-@ called officer , who sought after the coup of fear of persecution in asylum , the Turkish army would be in a few years &quot; full of extremis@@ ts and Sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such development could not cause such a development to Nato . &quot;
&quot; anyway , there are doubts in the alliance according to the pur@@ ges of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; leaders and operational capabilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; NATO diplom@@ ats say . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , cited by the media . &quot;
&quot; he sees to lower the legal immigrants at 50,000 per year , more str@@ ingent regulations for obtaining visa requirements and restrictions on families @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Republican and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by going to change the way citizens from other countries Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains of migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new candidate procedure will come to the candidate who have English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , cited by the American media . &quot;
ministry wants to cross the track for a race
&quot; over the past few months , over the future of the race sh@@ utt@@ les had been st@@ acked - now it is supposed to go quickly . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the year is to be built at the mar@@ ginal route , on which the tourist train leaves . &quot;
&quot; to secure the future of the race sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , according to the Information Department of Commerce this year we will start construction work on the track . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and re@@ work the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is known especially for tourism , &quot; &quot; declared Transport State Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the cost of repair of the track suffered from around 2.5 million euros .
&quot; of this sum , the country over@@ takes 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on which the shuttle will also be ordered in the future of the country , will be finally adapted , stated S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen train as the operator are already agre@@ eable about the technical details .
&quot; thus the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
that &apos;s why the race car will be ordered to be ordered on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is one of the popular rail link between the stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; in the course of a pilot operation , the circuit has been used by sufficient number of people to order them again in the future . &quot;
the circuit is also very strong in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
just as you thought it cannot be cra@@ zi@@ ed in 2017 a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots .
&quot; yes , in fact . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big thing .
&quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible robot@@ ics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ eri@@ ed professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start taking their ascension seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye @-@ color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key in publication of his new report . &quot;
modern sex@@ pu@@ ppen have developed off their infl@@ atable partners with a Sili@@ cone which feels warm to the touch of human reactions which are achieved by the artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also adapt to his robot according to his beliefs , and choose everything from the eye @-@ color of the robot to the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples up to the type or the colour of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it is still disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; Person@@ alities &quot; who would look progres@@ sively more progressive . &quot;
modern sex@@ pu@@ ppen have developed into robots with a Sili@@ cone .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot makes it possible for example to adapt their robot to the properties which they find pleasing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the &quot; &quot; True &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ robot &quot; &quot; with pre@@ programmed people like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; it may what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you like , etc . &quot;
in the course of the day she also has her m@@ oods - quite like real people !
&quot; it can be tired to be fixed on contempl@@ ation , or it can be &quot; &quot; in mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are many worrying aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace true human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female attributes , the all@@ usion to rape , if one is a step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( meaning here : res@@ ign@@ ation ) Far@@ rah , be@@ wil@@ low a most . &quot;
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it is on the site . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just a different sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their formation and increasing refinement indicate a somewhat ha@@ kl@@ eres and lowering in our culture , to a retreat of the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission to an optional en@@ core . &quot;
&quot; most men will of course not hold a sex robot , and while the FR@@ R note its rising popularity , they remain temporarily on the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what le@@ ak@@ age out of mar@@ ginal zones , can be in relation to the spirit of time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
and many people are not strange or offensive until they give the free market to them .
&quot; there is a certain over@@ l@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots at a time arise in which the rights of women are worldwide threatened , in which there is a president in the White House that pra@@ ises women sexually . &quot;
&quot; the most horrible aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s Tales &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the hand@@ maid &apos;s Tales &apos; ) are not the graphical pictures , the sle@@ epy body and the out@@ stretched eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builder want them to feel human and im@@ itate them that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot;
you cannot separate or simply go away from their companion .
&quot; they have no mediation or a background story , nothing that can interfere with independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are fake slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the Rede@@ mption of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tru@@ mp@@ s great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the ep@@ it@@ ome of the healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a Bin@@ sen@@ se@@ hood of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions , who pol@@ arized the U.S. voters , also split families in small @-@ format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and appointment , there were newspapers in the US newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tru@@ mp about selected relatives . &quot;
we are all pur@@ ported to let all of us pur@@ posed to burst our fil@@ ter@@ ies .
less not@@ ices were the power of Tru@@ mp@@ s to bring families together .
&quot; I chose this because my cousin , a left @-@ focused poet who lives in Chicago and has long visited the Re@@ public@@ ans in our family since a long time ago , I visited this week in New York . &quot;
they reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tru@@ mp in the White House everyone who knows it , including the republi@@ can relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side . &quot;
&quot; around the dining table , this certainly is a good thing , but it falls to me in a further context that this also brings considerable risks . &quot;
the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp but the distor@@ ting effect of his Presidency has the power to push all right to the right .
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the gross@@ est way that we no longer want to rep@@ el us of a day . &quot;
&quot; however , there is still a long @-@ time long @-@ time scenario in which Tru@@ mp Re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alizes , &quot; that suddenly appear in comparison with his standards suddenly as the ep@@ it@@ ome of denial . &quot;
&quot; I find myself nowadays from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s funny version of the crazy person - the dog on the car park , which looked 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax statement saw ) - both compared to Tru@@ mp in fact a very mild offen@@ se . &quot;
&quot; if Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of the Re@@ public@@ ans must be spiritually healthy to qualify as an im@@ measurable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my cousin was in the city , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ uss@@ ells of the New York Park@@ department , and the top three dollars that one can spend in the city when you don &apos;t need caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cris@@ p and the animals revol@@ ve to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ per@@ ing music conve@@ ys this in odd manner . &quot;
&quot; dis@@ appoint one city : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; five @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite across the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact no Swiss cottage - the theme pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; however , Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience , as there are two years old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s and have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I would have been able to evaluate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one has asked him afterwards . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced into a department store in a department store to rate my &quot; &quot; experience &quot; &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could go through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee corner of the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to tip the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also exercises pressure on the server to put personality into a situation where there is no need . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I tired the experience to reach my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar pist@@ ori@@ us with breast @-@ pain moved from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ory us has left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
&quot; last year , he was brought to hospital because of the treatment of cuts in his wr@@ ists , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ one was condemned because of the pro@@ secut@@ ors of the pro@@ secut@@ ors against a first tot@@ ality of the pro@@ secut@@ ors .
&quot; he sle@@ w Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of the Valent@@ ines 2013 , by putting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his home in Pre@@ toria . &quot;
Pist@@ us claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal inv@@ ader that hid in the c@@ ab in the c@@ ab .
&quot; the pro@@ secut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say they may be cau@@ tious . &quot;
&quot; the national law enforcement authorities said that they will rise to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year . &quot;
Pist@@ one does risk that his sentence increases to 15 years when the pro@@ secut@@ ors are successful .
there are no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ si@@ pi@@ ers from F@@ use and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and the advanced schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the dism@@ iss@@ aries go to the gymn@@ asi@@ um , four to the Real@@ schule . &quot;
Schul@@ director Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Bi@@ es@@ ental Citizens House in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
&quot; the 29 students of the four classes are elected by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ des , under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ des , a young eagle who grows up in the chicken . &quot;
&quot; this led the under@@ line a musical with the title &quot; &quot; The Adler in the chicken court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bauer Arnold was a strange egg , and he left it out of his chicken . &quot;
instead of a chicken a small eagle came out .
&quot; but the hope to make a chicken out of him , the eagle spread out on a high mountain its wings , and sw@@ am . &quot;
then the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken .
&quot; h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cy@@ linders were wearing to die bet . &quot;
&quot; the eagle stand for the integration , said Schul@@ leader Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the young is different from the other kittens &quot; ( ch@@ icks ) , but it belongs . &quot;
he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
she wished for every four @-@ four @-@ äss@@ ler that he has accepted himself in his new school .
&quot; there was a word in the colleagues , the former school leader Michael Müller , who always comes to teaching pol@@ ls , and parents representatives . &quot;
&quot; the Kü@@ ken@@ nel was now over , declared class teacher Sophia Schumacher . &quot;
&quot; they leave their students after two years of teaching , because it had been a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , she can rely on the quad@@ rup@@ t@@ win@@ der . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students left a song of summer time and holiday season . &quot;
&quot; so , with the children , great joy broke out . &quot;
for the new school year already eight first @-@ gra@@ der have already registered .
two Bulg@@ arians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned in Greece because of illegal camps , divided the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited on television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of August 1 was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia from the police a group of illegal de@@ cel@@ ed people , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
on the same day they were released while currently an examination runs .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
&quot; the Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated control of the free camps and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not meant for this purpose , but not for this purpose . &quot;
the controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine @-@ penalty .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those people need to know now
how accurate is the software update instead ?
must Diesel drivers participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW company software updates for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
they should improve the exhaust @-@ behavior of cars of the emissions classes 5 and partially euros 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are excluded .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin from Ace Auto Club Europe gives inv@@ alu@@ able :
is the new action compulsory ?
&quot; no , the controlled software updates are voluntary . &quot;
&quot; the obligatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles , the Schum@@ an software , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ ine . &quot;
the retro@@ fit has arranged the multi @-@ drive Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers receive information about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced a fast implementation in the next few months but still has no exact date .
Daimler has told everyone to write to everyone involved .
&quot; if any inspection is due , it will be done within the framework . &quot;
how long will the retro@@ fit take in total ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ ine . &quot;
these are dependent on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen voluntarily , the deal@@ ership on the subject of the environment so far failed . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the re@@ armament itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW company ? &quot;
the ACE tells you for waiting .
&quot; supposedly , foreign manufacturers would withdraw , so s@@ met@@ an@@ ine . &quot;
now threat@@ ens a massive price drop of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE feared that .
&quot; but even in the regions , where driving is threatening . &quot;
in rural areas there are so far no de@@ preci@@ ation for older diesel .
the ACE suggests that a sale has still to be seen .

&quot; the &quot; &quot; announced pri@@ ze@@ winners &quot; &quot; announced with progressive TV series , which is therefore already announced to take part in the participation in the gala . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; The New York Times &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; this presidency has decided to fully neglect the arts and human rights - even the means to un@@ cover them - and this deb@@ ited for me . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , she will use the conversation with Tru@@ mp to make their view clear . &quot;

we make the city li@@ vable
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ achs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes to R@@ ente in the coming year . &quot;
the place is already written - suitable applicants are rare .
for 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work still makes him great fun as he conve@@ yed in the press conference .
&quot; he reports from varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it mir@@ ac@@ ulous that so far no application has no application requirements . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or building engineer at the next time .
&quot; thus , under consideration of the regular dism@@ iss@@ al period - there is still enough time to work together . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ lach acts for the administration of the Board of Directors as a sub @-@ judicial authorities , the applic@@ ant must demonstrate the applic@@ ant . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city definitely .
&quot; if they can no longer fill them out , they would have to drive citizens to advice up to Offen@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; but the clos@@ eness of the city and to him are important , &quot; says W@@ acker , who has been told by a good company atmosphere , as well as good mood between the authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in office more than 30 years in office , some significant projects have already accumulated , back to the t@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city li@@ vable , &quot; &quot; he is confident about the construction and its employees . &quot;
but also in the future varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the precip@@ itation park are about to be desired .
&quot; the Kin@@ zig bridge between Bol@@ len@@ bach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the state re@@ mediation is still subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter will hit by approximately 1.5 million euros to be@@ ech , &quot; &quot; if we &apos;re doing it right &quot; , &quot; appreci@@ ates W@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; design @-@ aged for a city @-@ car@@ et@@ aker , large room @-@ room . &quot;
with Has@@ l@@ ah &apos;s own Bau@@ hof and G@@ ten@@ ner@@ ei could be respon@@ sive to a variety of flexibility .
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of green installations are often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye to have what fits &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going city master . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister carries high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is the owner , &quot; at the end everything goes through my table . &quot;
&quot; he has been able to count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing business for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( deep @-@ construction ) for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also that his successor remains long , W@@ acker : &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who would really be identified and staying in the place . &quot;
&quot; because continuity is not only important for a good operating system , but also for the further development of the city . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn Roland W@@ acker , after information about the city of Has@@ lach , should be able to show a completed study as a diplom@@ at engineer or a Bachelor &apos;s degree of expertise in the fields of construction and building materials . &quot;

bicycle on the lea@@ der@@ ships cast : south @-@ distance
&quot; according to police , the unknown perpetr@@ ator had thrown the blue bicycle from the rail@@ road crossing in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) . &quot;
these were so badly damaged that the desc@@ ending goods had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out from two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since the night time .
near the scene there were a pink sco@@ oters and a bike riders have been observed .
&quot; that goes far beyond the Laus@@ bu@@ ffer , &quot; &quot; said E@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch for AP@@ A . &quot;
&quot; the perpetrators , or the perpetr@@ ator could have brought himself in great danger and also threat@@ ens the train traffic . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the installation , as well as the late @-@ minute drive and the cost of rail transport could also be added to the perpetrators . &quot;
&quot; overall , from a &quot; substantial &quot; sum , the spokes@@ man said . &quot;
the damage was re@@ medi@@ ed on Friday afternoon and rail traffic on the south @-@ way could be led without disabilities .
&quot; almost ten persons were on Friday morning , two of them consider the remote traffic . &quot;
&quot; goods are not allowed , but they had a delay . &quot;
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged around 200 metres tops .
ins@@ ulators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
rot@@ ate meat , dairy products and chocolate might help to allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory intestine ) . &quot;
rot@@ es meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare .
&quot; but a new study highlights exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel diseases . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able state , affects approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 300@@ .000 , causes stomach cr@@ amping and g@@ ass@@ iness , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhea , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; during those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han developed by proteins to develop a tolerant intestine . &quot;
&quot; the guiding researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immun@@ cells in the intestine pat@@ rol in the intestines to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes hide themselves in the food not penetr@@ ate into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are capable of dis@@ solving inflammation , are balanced by cells which protect the tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissues . &quot;
if the balance is too far towards inflammation , it may result in an anti @-@ inflammatory disease . &quot;
&quot; in experiments , it was noted that some kind of tolerance promoting immune cell in mice can be found that carry a particular bacter@@ ium in her intestines . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial and Lac@@ tobac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich diet promotes tolerant , less anti @-@ inflammatory bo@@ unds if the same system also supports people . &quot;
&quot; the post@@ do@@ ktor@@ and@@ in Dr. Luisa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan sought a kind of immun@@ cell that had found the tolerance as she found out that a group of academic studies had such cells , but another group of the same tribe but had not been separated . &quot;
they presum@@ ed that the difference has had to do with the intestinal micro@@ bial of the mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the cervi@@ x of the mice were found DNA sequ@@ enced and there were six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells , but without them out of mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were put up in an sterile environment so that they were missing an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome , and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ th@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; in order to understand how the bacteria used to the immune system , the researchers led L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then floo@@ ded small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on im@@ mature immune cells that were isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed to the tolerant cells .
&quot; as the active component of the fluid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ Met@@ abol@@ ism known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 l@@ actic acid . &quot;
&quot; when the researchers double the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of the mice , the number of such cells increased by approximately 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ ces were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by the half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice and that most of us are protecting L. reu@@ th@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal tract .
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i can develop the cells in men as with mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , since these cells control infections on the inner surface of the intestine . &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ ous can result in the presence of L. reu@@ th@@ i to an expansion of this population . &quot;
José M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic a &quot; genius &quot; committed
&quot; at Manchester United has signed a &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , in Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut at S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pound Sig@@ nature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last season game , before the UEF@@ A @-@ super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday starts off , and aston@@ ished in the holder &apos;s role as people like Paul Sz@@ cz@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira . &quot;
&quot; however , MAT@@ IC had been excluded from the blues tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had to improve before starting the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him be ready earlier than later .
&quot; besides M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u was started in the Avi@@ va stadium , as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho his start @-@ XI for the start of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho has three other new commitments , but insisted that the club has already made a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four primary demands . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they got four out of four , but they have made great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US aircraft manufacturer has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle in the US state Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Michigan and moved in the shape of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers on the USA , which are several thousand kilometres . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
on the radar over@@ comes the shape of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing &apos;s logo was painted in the sky .
new freezing for Martin Schulz - Hannover ; we have a problem
&quot; but as the wind turns : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was yet SPD leader , the S @-@ democratic prime minister before elections were always with a certain concern to Berlin . &quot;
&quot; but there is no stor@@ fires from the party central , but no head@@ wind from the covenant - so was the most important desire of the election . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz the party has changed , the fundamentally has changed . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House are monitoring the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals . &quot;
what Schulz from there have been since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ wind .
there were low @-@ suggestions .
and one after the other .
the federal @-@ CD@@ U looks after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony a generic signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this once shows more : red green can simply not rule reli@@ ably , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber , the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising fac@@ tional resistance of a Gre@@ ens parliament passed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the election @-@ election the red @-@ green coalition lost their A @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Party Secretary Michael wa@@ iter was asked to give back their mandate to the Gre@@ ens @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens of El@@ ke .
the survi@@ vor of the CD@@ U signi@@ fies a clear distor@@ tion of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ west must immediately give back its mandate , &quot; said the deputy leader and electoral campaign of the Green Party in Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true all at all , si@@ ghs a SPD electoral campaign , as on Friday morning , the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ message reached the party central . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the passage of the green members of El@@ ke T@@ west to the CD@@ U without its own governance . &quot;
it is the preliminary point of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD national associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the misery started un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , cal@@ ming itself the comrades @-@ time . &quot;
&quot; after the European elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia , everything will be different . &quot;
so it was - and it all became much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into diving , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite hau@@ te the party smooth . &quot;
comrades dis@@ gr@@ aced the comrades in the weeks after that .
&quot; then when they had just finished new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him came the next door .
&quot; Mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD leader , lost its Nim@@ bus on that weekend , because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city burned . &quot;
&quot; and because he did so wrong in crisis communication , after that it was wrong . &quot;
since then Schol@@ z fights for his political survival .
so now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; because of the VW Ab@@ gas@@ eous and its role in the Supervis@@ ory Board , the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Prime Minister has already been in criticism for a long time . &quot;
mi@@ ese re@@ fraction was added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because , Wei@@ l tried to get stronger in the last few weeks in the federal acc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; the ambition of the former mayor of Hanover , his power in Berlin , remained not hidden from Martin Schulz in the surroundings of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they allow him to grant him because they spoke of Wei@@ l a stabili@@ zation of the party .
&quot; now , the exact opposite could happen . &quot;
&quot; thereby , Wei@@ l meets the party internal constra@@ int of the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on green in essence no fault . &quot;
and Schulz already did not .
&quot; sometimes , the comrades try to maintain their own ranks . &quot;
&quot; their wrath is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here above all to the ugly parliam@@ ent@@ arians of the life@@ jackets . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ arable and democratic , as Ms T@@ west places their own care@@ ers on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , Chief of the party left in the SPD @-@ Bundestag group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Ms. T@@ west is not elected because of her personality as a direct @-@ channel , but on the state list of the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens . &quot;
the logical consequence would it be that their mandate returns .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , leader of the SPD @-@ Bundestag group , compl@@ ains about an &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vote for four years ago was clear : the people have done Stephan Wei@@ l to the Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on SPD as a top can@@ did@@ ly in the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now , the personal Kar@@ ri@@ er@@ ed@@ ging of a future CD@@ U @-@ MPs said the W@@ ah@@ mann &apos;s result , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann continued . &quot;
he requested to clarify the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there had been more out@@ going ple@@ dges of the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
conve@@ ying for Ort@@ ers III
those who want to be able to work in the years can soon get support from the country .
&quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of urban development informed on Wednesday in sensi@@ tivities . &quot;
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave once again a review of the previous event .
since 1991 we have been giving it in sensi@@ tivities .
&quot; at that time , in the re@@ mediation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the land Baden @-@ Württemberg had over two thirds of the sum of the heads . &quot;
the grant from 2005 to 2016 was after at least 60 percent .
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous sanctions are a &quot; success project &quot; - it was ultimately important to promote the development of the interior , not only new building areas . &quot;
on April 4 I received the information of the Civil Society for the information that there will be a renov@@ ations III .
&quot; the sum total amount of 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the community sensation . &quot;
how does a renov@@ ations develop ?
&quot; one will continue to investigate as Sch@@ ind@@ ler on , where the &quot; truly old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; however , it also plays a role , whether in the planned area in general interest , to san@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the area of the area could also move again . &quot;
&quot; the jet@@ on on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Gothic . &quot;
&quot; cellar presented the contents of the federal government programme &quot; Social City , &quot; as part of which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the programme is the rev@@ itali@@ zation of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be object @-@ related , that is for each property . &quot;
the re@@ development area would eventually be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the operator has been running for funding from 1 January 2017 till 30 April 2017 .
&quot; however , until September this year , however , the inventory would only be performed , as part of those involved in the san@@ itation @-@ area involved a questionnaire to fill out . &quot;
&quot; in November or December the pro@@ posi@@ tional sign shall be made possible , so that in the coming year with the renov@@ ations can be started . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that every commune of the mentioned pre @-@ governing investigations have to be carried out . &quot;
it is about to assess the urban@@ istic mis@@ understanding and decide when it gets and to what extent .
it will then also be entered for the respective property for the respective property .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will again come to sensi@@ tivities again and make himself a picture of the situation , she spoke . &quot;
Got@@ zel emphasized that a significant success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
&quot; therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled out until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; building and property &quot; &quot; in which it is among other things about the construction state and the rehabilitation views . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; , &quot; information about size , distribution and residents of a living room can be made . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; arc &quot; &quot; is only to fill in the building sector . &quot;
&quot; however , in mind , the di@@ zel showed that a re@@ plen@@ ished questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; moreover , re@@ building actions are not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler stressed that the distribution of funding after the &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ful principle &quot; &quot; - who first comes first , ad@@ mon@@ ed first . &quot;
&quot; you could not make any support for the later &quot; &quot; reservation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a refurb@@ ishment &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; . &quot; &quot;
British inventor get a micro@@ chip even to get into home and car with a handic@@ raft movement
&quot; a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip so that he can enter his door@@ step , enter his office and even start his car with a handic@@ raft movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and foref@@ inger , and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consult@@ ative an@@ a@@ es@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resembles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
the married father of one has now built both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology that begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
&quot; the decision of the White House , a nav@@ y helicopter on the South La@@ wn for an event to fly , which highlights the American manufacturing last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the information of the military that the T@@ IME magazine are left up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky v@@ H @-@ 3D , known as nav@@ al One , if the president on board is the heart of the event on 17 July at the White House with American building programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and executive officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter built in Connecticut , was issued next to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ car from Wisconsin and a for@@ kli@@ ft from Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; the Military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicop@@ ters in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter on the South La@@ wn landed , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helicopter driver . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted to be aware of this because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 wrote on the eve of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 at the eve of his predecessor , the deputy nav@@ al period of aviation for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helicopter was met on 17 July at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 p.m. , and so long stayed , until the tur@@ f was cleared from 18 : 00 to 21 : 00 . &quot;
&quot; the note also adds , that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of the working hours a second team would need for the flight . &quot;
&quot; the original tra@@ int was at the event at the helicopter , while the security personnel of the unit remained during the time on the ground during the time . &quot;
the records provided from the T@@ IME available records were not clear whether in the end a second flight att@@ acking was required .
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal states to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could hurt the determination .
&quot; one question we asked was whether this was a violation of the H@@ atch Act , and we were informed that this was not the case , wrote the command . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; replied the deputy commander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as the official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act .
&quot; however , official events also have political over@@ tones . &quot;
&quot; at the event , the president gave an impetus to reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to con@@ tainment the governmental regulation . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , which is known as nav@@ One or Air Force One , from politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
Presidents are oblig@@ ated to use them for the journey .
&quot; but , to request their use only for a photo @-@ OP , is unusual . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp conducted an investigation in February as the presidential plane in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of reports that will be informed about the use of the presidential office through its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products made up of all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said vice president of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 @-@ cre@@ ws often lead training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn to place the U.S. President in the White House with precise centimeters .
&quot; as Tru@@ mp in early July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 was carried out in the White House 58 exercises . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event was en@@ vis@@ aged by the training need for the month , said an official . &quot;
hel@@ o@@ cop@@ ter units flew in addition to 11 hours a day for &quot; non @-@ presidential campaign . &quot;
&quot; the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers were the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps , presented at the event . &quot;
&quot; a narr@@ ator of Si@@ kor@@ sky , said the company was not involved , to exhibit the helicopter on the South La@@ wn . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 has no bud@@ get@@ ters for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to St@@ und@@ am@@ ari@@ fen of the U.S. Department of Defense for the Year Financial Year 2017 , the DO@@ D replacement tool for the v@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight @-@ hour . &quot;
&quot; records of unity recorded the flight time of the aircraft than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico , Virginia . &quot;
the White House argued that the actual cost for the operation of the helicop@@ ters are far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax pay@@ ers on the basis of the estimates for the survey rates , is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates contain staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual resources . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study dating from 2015 the savings rates for DO@@ D do not include the personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract completion . &quot;
&quot; at this time the former press review of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ends , the deployment of the helicop@@ ters for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present these week things that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ect@@ . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
&quot; and I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked tirel@@ ess@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to highlight this . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp with the helicopter inter@@ viewed , when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the seat of a fire@@ bird . &quot;
in the White House Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and jo@@ king with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of a tricky task
leading the second tennis @-@ Bundes@@ liga takes place at the Tab@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
the TC blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will take place tomorrow from 11 am in Kiel at the Tab@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
&quot; despite the five games ever mak@@ ell@@ os@@ er &apos;s balance sheet , the top @-@ rated of the second tennis courts have received the sense of reality . &quot;
team chief Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has any respect for the opponent .
this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation .
&quot; right at the rear positions , I find the team very good . &quot;
&quot; for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V , primarily the imports from the high north . &quot;
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to bets on the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with sight on Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ör@@ en and Es@@ ben O@@ read , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen , and Andreas Bj@@ er@@ hus ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; this is how it is difficult for us .
&quot; you also need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ sians team for the trip to the high North stands practically .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
it is currently creating the Challen@@ ger tournament in the Italian bi@@ ella running Fren@@ chman did not create the Bundes@@ liga game in the Italian Liber@@ ec compete in the Czech Liber@@ ec championship ( Czech Republic ) for its first use in this season .

how America can harm the O@@ MV
&quot; really happy , Donald Tru@@ mp did not work when he sat under the law on secrecy of sanctions against Russia . &quot;
&quot; in his ha@@ ste , the law to en@@ act , the Congress has packed a few &quot; Constitu@@ tional regulations &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the response from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels sh@@ amed against the US @-@ incur@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the design looks ahead to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU . &quot;

Rolle back@@ wards : the town presents 46 kitchen equipment
the city organized the K@@ ita @-@ lunch table once again .
with fixed contact partners for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the urban kinder@@ gart@@ ens the clock will be turned back .
&quot; on September 1 , the city Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the urban kinder@@ gart@@ ens ( Kit@@ as ) back into reg@@ reg@@ y . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy director in the field of youth , this is good news : &quot; we were all very happy . &quot;
&quot; cooked , except house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies fresh@@ ly cooked cool@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the city runs in the Kre@@ feld area 46 kinder@@ gart@@ ens , in 44 children get a warm meal . &quot;
&quot; in the past kitesur@@ fing year , 2@@ 800 children were sitting at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , not only children who are taking care of 45 week@@ days , in the cat &apos;s lunch , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care if children stay until 14 pm .
&quot; 46 part @-@ time staff members from 1 September kitchen : they war@@ ms the angel@@ fish food , supplement them about salad , raw food and fruit , propor@@ tion@@ ate the meal individually , give the food out , clean up and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a ca@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ group @-@ groups as well as sevent@@ een @-@ tro@@ op facilities - decides on the length of length .
&quot; the kitchen helping now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; so they are much more involved , and it is easier for kitesur@@ fers to implement educational concepts . &quot;
because it is also a matter of healthy nutrition and cooking classes .
&quot; the children should help , prepare food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen force to the team is meaningful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known power in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita rooms - previously also the task of the kitchen - will be completed in the future of specialized cleaning personnel .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen , it also has the charm that it has turned out in the cost between self @-@ reg@@ y and a foreign award for the city as the most economical , it is from the press . &quot;
and that even though 46 part @-@ time forces be re@@ comp@@ uted .
&quot; but these hours fall to approximately 750 people in the educational area not so strongly in weight , &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women who says the UN
&quot; elections can only be representative when all members of society , including women , play a role , said the leader of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ som , official leader of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women are can@@ cel@@ ing in the provinces . three women are can@@ cel@@ ing for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credible when women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial Council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April .
the Taliban have made threats against a election process which coinci@@ des with the transition of international combat operations to an advisory role .
this year the elections for the first time will be handed over to power peacefully from a democr@@ atically elected government .
Hay@@ som said a strong role for women will still strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan .
Afgh@@ an independent electoral commission reported that 1.2 million women were registered by a total of registered 3.2 million voters .

GM@@ B concern over investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
a union would like to make a union with managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it @-@ manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie on the long term obligation to produce production in Glasgow .
GM@@ B Scotland said the company was concerned about the future of investment in the Tol@@ l@@ cross location .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the factory , which places addition to other products of plan@@ no@@ bs and rich tea biscuits . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds over the last few years .
&quot; he added that employees and trade unions were &quot; &quot; first experienced &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Fili@@ alle@@ ites of the company , GM@@ B Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s came to express our concerns that the financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be prop@@ elled . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tol@@ l@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned . &quot;
generations of families have worked here and the workers are concentrated strongly on the local community and the Greater Glasgow - an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social discrimination .
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , the wage and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ xit , the rising cost of life and the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently is a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ alle@@ ites at Tol@@ l@@ cross has received a letter from GM@@ B Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to that , as we estimate the continued commitment of employees and trade unions . &quot;
&quot; two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and GM@@ B representatives in Tol@@ l@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees , that we operate as all companies , who are active in an extremely competitive and uncertain business community , and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to be competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognise the heritage of Tol@@ l@@ cross as a production site fully and fully . should our operations change at the location , employees and trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years ago before Ne@@ ym@@ ar ?
the website of La League may share their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain did not take place in its persecution by Ne@@ ym@@ ar , after taking a quote from £ 18@@ 9 million , to dis@@ solve its free@@ wheel clause , but do you have warned Barcelona three years before the world market ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , whereby Paul Sz@@ cz@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after completion , Ne@@ ym@@ ar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the most paid professional athletes of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious over the way , how Ne@@ ym@@ ar is on its way outside , although a source is always close to the Catal@@ ans , that the club always has its best to take care of it since its arrival from Santos in 2013 . &quot;
but has been warned of the football world three years ago by the PS@@ G President before this prospect ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 , she was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any club who wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
&quot; but if you try to sign one of our players at their sign , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , with the Spanish club at the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G @-@ middle player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could sense the consequences of this interest by losing one of their prize packages for Ne@@ ym@@ ar . &quot;

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Report ent@@ sia Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the abuse of waste ent@@ ails Pope @-@ brother George R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ eman .
the conclu@@ ding report for mis@@ use sc@@ andal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussions .
&quot; Christian Weis@@ ger , spokes@@ man of the reform@@ ist movement &quot; &quot; We are church , &quot; &quot; declared after the publication of the German Press Agency , he who expect from former Regen@@ s@@ burg Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ ated Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
it would be very useful to the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would like to express their deep understanding about their own sub@@ yo@@ ffs or their wrong assessment of the processes at that time .
&quot; the Vatican &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand cri@@ tici@@ zed that in the reporting of force on violence in the domain @-@ cats with &quot; &quot; different measure &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the author of Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian , and a member of the national Italian bio@@ ethics committee , &quot; is the author of Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historians and member of the national Italian bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit that den@@ ote the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of the day @-@ day experience and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in the interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; one likes to go on to the church and this is a crazy fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
&quot; moreover , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; stro@@ kes a quite normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one , ready to be finished . &quot;
&quot; it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , because the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse , Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appeared often . &quot;
&quot; completely wron@@ g@@ ly , the author and historian Michael Hes@@ eman , who was translated with R@@ atz@@ inger the reminder &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated in 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protecting , &quot; &quot; says H@@ eman , &quot; &quot; For all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he adds the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly stands in the 4@@ 40 @-@ page report that was commissioned by B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the En@@ lighten@@ ment lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Rain@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen have been sexually abused between 1945 and early 1990s &quot; &quot; with high Pl@@ au@@ si@@ sen@@ sibility &quot; &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually abused &quot;
&quot; at the closing report , it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , which was engaged from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , it can be held that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases , physical and psychological violence were applied . &quot;
especially on high levels of Emoti@@ on@@ ality the punishment for the students could be disa@@ strous .
&quot; in contrast to numerous other alleg@@ ations , many victims were estimated to attract the general humanity of R. , and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories . &quot;
&quot; in the interview of H@@ esh@@ emann , why the conclu@@ ding report on the abuse of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger explains his opinion un@@ paved . &quot;
&quot; Mr. H@@ ide , the 4@@ 40 @-@ pages report on the &quot; Inci@@ dents &quot; of violence against shel@@ ters at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; is a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , many students lift up his &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a chol@@ era and perfec@@ tionist who became more in@@ comprehensible if a Dom@@ sp@@ atz was musically no top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate as his bi@@ ographer this final report ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ eman : when you get the trouble and read the entire 4@@ 40 pages long report from the front to the rear , one needs to ask yourself more , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger at all can be found at all . &quot;
it is dedicated just eight pages and it is clearly spoken by any suspici@@ on of the mid@@ - or co @-@ workers in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
&quot; non @-@ violence at the Pre @-@ College was also un@@ event@@ ful outside of its effici@@ encies . &quot;
you can refu@@ te him if not too late or have not taken the first hint of it seriously .
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ian gymn@@ asi@@ um at which he appeared , was perceived by practically all respon@@ dents as - as literally - &quot; redemption &quot; , &quot; &quot; Heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so also the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger presents an excellent testimony , &quot; &quot; sincerely , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely well @-@ nat@@ ured teachers who cat@@ ches the guys regularly with cakes , biscuits and bon@@ ons and &quot; always accompanied by grapes grown by children . &quot;
only a minority is compl@@ ained about its Perf@@ ec@@ tion@@ ism and its high levels of emoti@@ ve that also lead to swe@@ ep .
&quot; he did not only cast it with chairs and cast the key@@ chain on the ground , but also called ear sol@@ em@@ ies on the hair or ears , he himself gave herself many years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and exc@@ used for that . &quot;
&quot; however , to his honor , however , it must be said that such educ@@ ators were widespread in the questionable period , the 1960s and 1970s , as well as parents such as teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us , who was born in 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a worldly school , a state @-@ Gymnasium . &quot;
&quot; compared to what it is actually going on in this report , namely exp@@ ir@@ replac@@ eable sexual abuse and violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , these are certainly dre@@ ad@@ els . &quot;
&quot; you ask yourself , whether it is not more likely to do with his acquaint@@ ance and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media has just crashed onto him . &quot;
&quot; at the Bav@@ arian Pope , many who have never understood him still di@@ lig@@ ently . &quot;
but the truth is : the report rel@@ aying Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
&quot; in the media , the report was reported much about the issue of abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will also be placed in the final report or co @-@ workers with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ eman : very much no .
no single of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have become familiar to the domain master .
not even the parents were consecr@@ ated .
&quot; I never saw myself to talk to my father or mother over it , &quot; &quot; said a person concerned for the others , &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrassing for me . &quot;
the real problem with clarification of sexual abuse was and is that most victims of shame silence .
&quot; if they do not even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir manager , who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ator . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen student R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ eman : a respon@@ dent student form@@ ulate it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he had had ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had been timely and could have had the respective perpetrators .
&quot; I think it ... also for truly absurd , to accept that they have just opened it ... bo@@ ars more pressing or clearer or even more likely to have opened as compared to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s , trust teachers , etc . &quot;
that you speak to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; thus , the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; that the pupils and / or their environment trusted , could not be confirmed in the context of the examination . &quot;
&quot; regarding sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore released from every fellow @-@ learning . &quot;
&quot; so it cannot be thrown out , not prevented him or brought it to the display . &quot;
&quot; hence , there is no reason to bring his good name to these dis@@ war@@ dly crime as it was unfortunately in some cases . &quot;
in the media was much of &quot; non @-@ violence &quot; during the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will be thrown away in the report .
must he live with this repro@@ ach ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ eman : this is the big problem that in the reporting everything has been mixed and mixed to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and non @-@ violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; yet , exactly this is a mis@@ use of the report . &quot;
&quot; namely , it is clean separately : between the primary school and the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the cathedral @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and violence , we say once , other anticip@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report incidents have been treated from the time since 1945 , so also for four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral of the domain cats . &quot;
&quot; the whole dre@@ ad@@ ful ped@@ agog@@ y ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which the child of sa@@ di@@ st teachers were literally lay@@ ered and mal@@ ignant , un@@ ra@@ ined on the pres@@ ch@@ ool of Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to be taken . &quot;
&quot; but with those who had nothing to do with them , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he had got the boys to face as she was already on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ian gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
this was how most witnesses emphas@@ ise the topic of &quot; Pre @-@ School &quot; tab@@ u .
&quot; we were only happy to be escaped , and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; heavenly &quot; . &quot; &quot;
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ian gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ eman : there was a discipline , but not a sa@@ di@@ st violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims were estimated by R. R. , and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories with him . &quot;
that is at the most still the repro@@ ach to have taken away .
&quot; however , despite all efforts , the report was able to define only two periods of time , in which it was reported by the states on the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 when he started to establish themselves and was in charge of the events at a school where he was not involved and responsible , ( so the witness ) wanted nothing , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ended in front of the states consistently the ears ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ eman : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ian gymn@@ asi@@ um which the report was even reproduced . &quot;
&quot; in this , he points out that in the pres@@ ch@@ ool will continue to practice the test penalty . &quot;
&quot; already in the face of the danger of negative press public , he recommended urgent action . &quot;
&quot; of course , this was of course at a time when legal clarity was passed , as exam@@ inations were also recently prohibited in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; before that , they occurred in a legal gra@@ vation zone , just like any one of us probably knows . &quot;
&quot; it was hard to estimate for him , where the person might be exagger@@ ated or dramatic , and where really the per@@ missible limit had been exceeded . &quot;
but it can also not be said he would have always looked at hand .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the results of schools were officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria too .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis asser@@ ted that it is unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards at the time of time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ eman : we historians talk about the &quot; &quot; pit@@ falls of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; , &quot; i.e. the danger of evaluating the past in today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
the princess has already right .
&quot; but this does not apply to sexual abuse which had been ab@@ omin@@ able at all times , and also not for what was rooted in the pres@@ ch@@ ool of ad@@ versity and violence to inno@@ cent child shri@@ mp@@ s , that goes far beyond that time . &quot;
&quot; this is all so terrible , and I am glad that it is finally applied . &quot;
but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protecting ; for all this had nothing to do with him .
&quot; his means for discipl@@ ining and punishment , thus ear@@ nest and ears to pull together were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then forbidden , he has also strictly kept it in it . &quot;
&quot; which picture from his Regen@@ s@@ burger Zeit has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because in the talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ? &quot;
was the subject of investig@@ ating also for speech ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ eman : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells of his perspective , because the cathedral @-@ cats played only one side . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I am not at all ashamed that he led a strict reg@@ iment there . &quot;
&quot; but even that must be said once again : without these Perf@@ ec@@ tion@@ ism , without the asking for un@@ conditionally discipline , it would hardly have been possible to form an institution of world tran@@ scri@@ g , true cultural bot@@ ies in Europe and his musical tradition , which went to tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with biscuits and bon@@ ons alone you make no big singers and stand before any success , right in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming . &quot;
what kind of man did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks about her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ eman : through working on the book and in addition I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well over and over again as wonderful , humor@@ ous , in@@ fer@@ ous , deep @-@ believing and sav@@ age good people , from which one could not imagine that he could do just a fly . &quot;
&quot; I get regularly with how many former estates are still today , 23 years after his Em@@ eri@@ ding , regularly contact him to visit him - he is almost blind - and to treat him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who have not for@@ given him up to this day , that he once was strictly speaking to them , are clearly in the minority . &quot;
&quot; most domain cats are grateful to him today , that he has enriched their lives and put them into the world of music . &quot;
&quot; and that he always was a good , pat@@ ern@@ al teacher - a str@@ ingent father , certainly , that may be - but also a like@@ able respect , to which they still look up and honor them . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clearly : all that one casts to him are educ@@ ators , who were then on the agenda at that time . &quot;
we can be glad that we have recently overcome this time .
&quot; but it is highly un@@ just , a man , only because he is promin@@ ently and has a more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al scap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intention that stands behind it , just too apparent . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just released , reli@@ eved him . &quot;
