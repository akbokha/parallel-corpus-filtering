<seg id="2">"an Irish-institution, where young people are to meet today."</seg>
<seg id="3">A tomb kapelle where is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Gardeners cultivate the one-time ground of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It nerve if maps are not up to date.</seg>
<seg id="7">"that knows everyone, who had to make yourself exciting, because the auto-Navi took place a green meadow instead of a walk-up street."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas of Bavaria of the State Government, are anything but current - but it is therefore very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork carpet that can be seen as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"for cities and communities have been introduced for more detailed maps, such as priming sheets."</seg>
<seg id="13">These arisen according to the data of the Bayerische Vertics administration between 1810 and 1864 and in the first Vermessung Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your Customer: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French chairmen occupied Bavaria since the spring 1800 during the Second Koalife War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording of Bayerns - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"although French troops ended with the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801, it was today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph driving forward the project and founded the" "Topographic Bureau" "- and thus the Bayerische Mechanical Management."</seg>
<seg id="19">The prototype sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like any other to find on the website of the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison morning / Today is the most impressive state of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has spread over all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example of this is subsendling that appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was founded 21 years after the map, thus 1877, as a Munich city district."</seg>
<seg id="24">Today it is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendings are concentrated in 1856 along the current Plinganserstrasse, which was named after George Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the West park is, there is nothing but a fields - at the first glance: in the Hineinzooma it appears a smaller and smaller card with unused lines and numbers: handwritten flurks from the so-called" "urine recording" "from which the basic tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">"small parcels do not go there for farmers more - but also the gardener of the plant" "land in Sun." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, since 1810 venue of the October fests, was in fact a meadow - and not concrete."</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the field of the district Au-Haidhausen reads not only the street name "at the Gasteig" or of the height "On the air" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once met people with manifold problems."</seg>
<seg id="33">There was 1858 / 59 the Munich district of the Irrenaissance in 1858 / 59.</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard of Gudden led the establishment of a psychiatrist who is associated with the death of King Ludwigs II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressively for his time and ended, for example the accusation of so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he is forbidden to apply the staff to apply violence against the passengers," says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Museum of Haidhausen, who has engaged in an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients had been first place, later on 500 seats were extended."</seg>
<seg id="38">"sometime, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the rotary penitentiary in hair 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"there is the Isar-Amper Klinikum Munich-East since 2006, one of Germany's largest psychiatry."</seg>
<seg id="40">On the area of former Auer Anstalt now people encounter young people in the Munich Salesians.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and changed it into a youth home with training.</seg>
<seg id="42">"to the west is the football ground of the TSV Munich east, east of the cottages from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015 we set up the children's house" "Casa Don Bosco" "- in arquitecture to the origin of the Irrenaissance, which was destroyed during World War II in bombardment."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was named after 1856 as the" "Head Square", "the name of the department name was" Kaufinger alley. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought to the Second World War in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies were in the city of December 1944 many holes in the city center.</seg>
<seg id="47">A large one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business buildings and a tomb of the Middle Ages was once at the Marienhof, where this day will take the pre-work and on 5 April 2017 of the sod for the second S-Bahn line."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider, the old Munich-card can be compared with the aerial view of today - and the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights-group published travel-warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association of promoting Farming has issued a warning for color people who are travelling to Missouri because of the discriminatory politics and the racist attacks of the state to Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Board for the State of Missouri, who will enter into force by the State until 28 August 2017, as a series of questionable, race-based incident can occur at the last time throughout the country and here, it is stated in the opinion of the group."</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes people harder to win discrimination, as well as the prosecution of the state, which resulted in disproportionate minorities, prompted the group to put out the journey, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have wounds of civil rights, people happen."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin colour, they are crushed or killed," "said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star."</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear discomfort in such a frequency, which we have not heard yet."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group quoted incidents like racist promises against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after having no gasoline anymore during the journey and taken by the police of Missouri in custody without a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the General Council of Missouri, where it is shown that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than whites."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and employees inform about what might happen in Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">People have to be willing to bring about whether they bring us money or their relatives know that they are travelling through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri in 2015, 2014 was signed up to 100 meetings, according to the latest figures from the real-hate reference program of the FBI, which steps the state with regard to the number of such injury to the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">"the travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would make it harder to reduce a company because of living or employment discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had published travel warnings for Texas and Arizona since the states had approved immigration legislation to commit people because of migrates to further pension profile."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in recent times stakeholders have used the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Weighing Project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fishery Weidejot Project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU bundles Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have released a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">"during the village of Schwendemann, representatives of the fishing village of Kwendemann met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two representatives."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann finally granted insights into its operation, in which he houses 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of Woods, 40 Milcah and also many kittens, and in five apartments."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "black milk" "is for him the alternative markeless marketer for the milk of his cows, so swiveling."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengste comes exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"since he is also the BLHV chair of Fischbach, he called the Weighing project as a" elementary project. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not manage on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green space for a lot of work, much would have to be processed with the motor-sense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here with the conditions and the topography," stressed Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the elteral operation and delivered these without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if it is not a biooperation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" "the Commune has recognised the significance of the hamlet, and is glad to promote the leader."</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare the farmers had to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the afforestations of the areas might still be pulled out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have, are the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts of how they carry on their farm," "said the mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often standing in criticism due to the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">More than 25 plots were enclosed in 2013 by eleven participants in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The Disclosure surface is about 40 hectares which may not be unexplored until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">"of the total cost of 71 500 euro was funded half by Leader, a quarter performed by the municipality of fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers remaining 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of fences," stated Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and land, it isn't."</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter White stood firm: "here the best food is produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The coalition-shredding (LPR) Baden-Württemberg to the state promotion of pasture-fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Precondition is the presence of one of the LPR-signed conveyor belts.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the fenced area may not be towed (Hanging over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the fishing village in 2018, by 2018 we are currently using eight participants with 24 plots who want to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the surface area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is it when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these equally like any other - hence the downstream overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad in the year 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump-regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic Axt with Jim Acosta from CNN about the proposals of the President for the dramatic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-imitators would have borrowed him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he grabbed their meaning and especially the meaning that you have been attributed to, when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to his base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta:" "I do not want to go down here to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world."</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem which you relate to be added later and not part of the original statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is true of factually right, but as he formulate it itself, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary response to the touching words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" "your tired, your poor, / your crowding masses that are longing to breathe freely, / the elending waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "miserable waste" was better seen on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller has not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural engagement: it is indeed a conflict about the significance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who sat down to place their words after their death at the base - knew very good that they have done a high-political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republican by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in an intentional classic depiction of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract -- it has a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she himself gives herself a very different name: mother of the Exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist Coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and exactly how Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great cry for rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was anyone asking anyone, but rather an early neoconservatives, who bring the American flame into the surrounding world:" "Lady Liberty goes forward."</seg>
<seg id="119">It is intended to wear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not supposed to enlighten the way to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on a little razor.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is entirely a question of the perception of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative effect of Lazarus was in the fact that they see, as they were seen by the creators, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the Decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"it is in the true sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and find a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective that Miller's Miller and Trump would ever wish to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch is not supposed to enlighten their way, but the hate who is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle is reminded of a time when only two Scots belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance director of the Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member contingent contingent of the World Championships will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 that starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "in Scotland is developing something special" and the Athletics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it," "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the guy at the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals-candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m circuit, while Eiliie Doyle's team has been chosen for team capacity."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest,"</seg>
<seg id="141">"her captain's speech was incredible," "says Black."</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or exercising, they went out of the room and felt very proud and were highly motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and real feeling that Eilidh very naturally introduced, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth-Silver Medal, which is in her fifth world championships with the 400-m hurdles, says that it's" unbelievable "is that 16 Scots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven who were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-range Muir lead on this path and last year has established five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">"they will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runners."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, the 1,500 m running, is another Scotsman that one should observe after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminded of their first World Championships as the only other Scotsman in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team leaders says that they are" enormously proud "of the fact that many of their compatriots would not only belong to the team, but in some cases with the medals and the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"what is special about team captain, it is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that anyway it was a great honour, but knowing that my team mates have voted for me and chosen me, makes it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on Podien."</seg>
<seg id="155">What are my speech as captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think it went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">"I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a home world championship."</seg>
<seg id="158">"so, it is really important to put on this home backup and benefit from that we are back at the Olympiastadion."</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking critic about Facebook: do not take you to a public office if you cannot tolerate the income of electorate.</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers beat him because of the internal policy to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he slipped in the critique, for sure."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783 Washington said, Washington:" freedom of speech can be taken away - and, dumb and dumb we will run as sheep for battles. "</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to governor Larry Hogan who needs to work more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and erased their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union gave him the conclusion of this week at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the rod of the Governor left the lawsuit as frivol, and the online comment was full of a reaction-reaction with" Well, "and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">"this is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which is surprisingly popular."</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to debated his hakeless head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"hence, the blockage of individuals who come to the Governor side - which is a public forum that is officially referred to as officially and by employees working with public tax dollars - needless and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans entered into Amelia Chasse the actions of the Governor and argued that the blockage of the comments is nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too easy to use the picture of trolling or spammers, or hate people who swing online the whip."</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur, and a pastor, not a trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profound."</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor gave the Bible in his post and appeals to Hogan's Catholic Faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hasserted, but she asked for hate relationship."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate relationship and other current news," "wrote them in the commentary box of the message" "The Post". ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea if a number of people take place in the same topic, then they become disregarded by some rather than so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the employees of the Governor were" "concentrated" "spam attack", "others would probably call" intercession. ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"the Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocked a critic or a negative comment."</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical ladles, to burn and burn demonstrators and silence."</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly this is happening digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials who is criticized on Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused of Twitter users that were blocked from his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question came to Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County was last the First Amendment, according to the U.S.Cacheris in Alexandria, when they proclaimed a voter from their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky was governor Matt Bevin (R) received a visit to ACLU because of its use on Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at present, Washington had a similar effect at the time of affordable porttos, such as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letterers hit his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington had an anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people who use pseudonyme such as Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote all letters to newspapers, the Washington's decision. "</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions, who criticised his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping on the UK, was overwhelmed by the historical documents issued by the George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not silenced it to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"free speech, disagreement and discourses belong to the foundation of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means that to accept.</seg>

<seg id="1127">"PSG can make sure to make money loose, so that Neymar will sign up and bring it into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the energy rich mistress of Qatar."</seg>
<seg id="1128">"associations are allowed to raise a lot of money for the purchase of players, but must be controlled with legitimate income of income, which allow them to allow the break-even point in their play to football-related business."</seg>

<seg id="1317">The big life live: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have this little Earls Court apartment transformed into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resisted in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne took their pockets unpacked and sold.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," "says Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I searched for something, which was comparable to my price."</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown in Earls Court this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I loved it in love and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet was completely obsolete."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-bedroom property with a veiled layout - one needed to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add a shower room and a mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my requirement," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="1328">"to this end, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms to each other, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creative thinking to resolve the pre-release.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel plant is quite complicated," "he explains."</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked one another, without having to wigs ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about building a simple platform, but to set the steel so that he had the right height at the top or at the bottom."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement allowed it Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and Vintage Serge Mouille lighting put the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"mirrors play a role in addition to theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor mirrored to make him last longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirroring feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance mirrored units can accommodate all records and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous body, the beauty of the housing can include the kitchen when it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering worked out there," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF-door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is very important, so that if you slide the door very easily."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the basics - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will occur and a calculation based on the floor size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here, they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high quality materials that give space to the room its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional attachment in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't love you into the electric plug-ins in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they are not playing with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square meters of something standard in something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"in fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave these."</seg>

<seg id="1810">The employees of the Weekly Riodoce will normally meet in order to review their plans for the latest chaos in the state Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt civil servants and unceasing drug wars. "</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about safety."</seg>
<seg id="1812">"it has been told to them, that it is important to change their routines."</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists discuss what is more confident about: they should take their children to the office, who were in 2009 the target of an attack with shells, or they will be at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"safety experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: adversaries, neutral, ally."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"ask the reporter to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abs."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists, who are suspected of standing on the salaries of the government or the cartels, a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no rest of violence, and throughout the country the corpses are common there are more and more journalists at the same time: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven states."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter are the editors and their inspiration from Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist, Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence is perceived deeply, although its presence is present everywhere - a great photo of Valdez, which shows its mid-finger with the word" Justice, "hangs at the façade of the Riodoce-building. two reporters in the 1930's, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamaniut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, its nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although 2010 was established a sonant federal government in order to process the cases of journalists, it adopted according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most of the thousands of killings, which are linked every year with drug trading and organised crime, the murderers of journalists will rarely be judged."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce still they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are untrapped and although the terrain is now still traitor."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without any information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for discussion of security has little benefits, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very silly to waste my time in this workshop," says he. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know the Why, we trust everyone."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he made it just to drive a few blocks away, before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably due to the name of the newspaper - who is translated with" Twelfter "." "</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius took away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a wife and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans arrest in the past year and the delivery in the United States in January was Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest slaughter fields of the country, since rivaling groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it makes nothing that in Sinaloa each day someone or several people are shot down on the road or that the cemetery is full of twisted, two-story mausoleums for drug users who are larger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget for a minute, that there is a state of" peace "if only a Kartell has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs merchandise in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaling cases of antitrust in the war with Guzmans children."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have annoyed the sons, presumed gangonmembers bought any copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kioske."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was not to force Valdez, after the confiscation of another paper that had published the same story, leaving the country to his own safety."</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad and its killing will be regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues instructed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He was engaged as an experienced reporter for Noroeste when he joined together with five colleagues for the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the robbed problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with time, the paper served a reputation because of courageous and honest coverage, and the sales and the promotion took place."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved it to publish hard-going studies without fear of censorship, and the reader were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else would treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the creation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Prize" "for her coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history, wherever they lead."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He voluntarily gave up voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue living," "he said at the time of the CPJ award."</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trading in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You will need to take over the task that you want as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what did you do in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what was going on?</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce-team missed Valdez, the Spaak-bird, who was like a dockworkers, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">You trust his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Manatí, the bar opposite the office, go and sit there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now, they ask, was his love for the routine of his destruction?"</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also has forced her to ask her own assumptions about how they can do their work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they do not like it if you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their home starting points and landing ways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"anger is said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that" odor is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happens with Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are not in Sinaloa - just as not as in Tamarlipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, in which a poisonous blend of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the employees of Riodoce met for safety training, there were suddenly no cellphones allowed. days before has been known that Spyware issued exclusively to governments, to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were asked by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle class quarter of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joz, some of the reporters asked whether this officers belong to the 50 percent of policemen who signed the governor itself as not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs were de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce has been licked on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former known boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state spending on the home town of Governors concentrated.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"there was a group that was in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, one block from the office of the citizen, a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records, that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy leader that reigned over the whole century all political levels."</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several PRI governors were accused of high-level cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about the previous incidents in this eatery including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman went to a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months earlier, the reader had seen the column of Valdez, as the best informed source about the kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"sooner we had already knew what happened," "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" "El Flaco" "because of its slim body creation."</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez has been dedicated to storage space for signs and stickers to protest against the killings of journalists, because the employees have become something they had never anticipated: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went up next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Added disappeared three days after Valdez, had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burnt body was discovered and officials, based on DNA tests that it is."</seg>
<seg id="1890">"journalists in the whole country have become a statement of journalists, by establishing them in organised protests" SOS Press "on salary and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"this day, the director Bojorquez is gone in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to send journalists to journalists and make them change the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"since then, it has not been asked that the government is divided again by the government, because it is worried that their rage has violated their objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez repeatedly had said that journalists in Mexico was surrounded by organised crime, involved with government officials and a uniform society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" "Narco-Journalism", "he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug subjects, but also on the orders of politicians and security guards who were under organised crime under a blanket."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"the Media-Wächtergroup" "Articulo 19" "took more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials in the past year."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico do you die because they want you to the mouth," said Ramirez. "</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously the killings have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"your body was found together with a note that was said to be signed by Zetas Kartell," Here am I for my reports. "</seg>

<seg id="1904">In 2010 the Diario de Ciudad Juarez built publicly on the drug cartels with an editorial page on the title page "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their own countries or even out of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It's hard to find work in exile and they still watch the streets and look for dangers.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes, they are hunted as evidently were murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who continue to stay and continue working, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, gives to that the drug trading is scared him."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico is going to hell, and so I was reporters," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat down on the sidewalk in front of the office and trance beer, when all their phones started."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of shoots with Bandora and security guards in the vicinity of the bathed Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war escalate on how it was promised by a series of Kartell messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">From the on-board edge you have released the news on the website of Riodoce on mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The front page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirenen heults nearby - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">"Bojorquez threw a look at the policemen, the guards stopped to see if they were in willingness."</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid, they did not show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the powerful portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle-finger was visible for the whole Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed its tracks."</seg>

<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used camouflage to soften his enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">At first sight it looks like a statue when a frightening.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"now, researchers have found that the first knowledge of the unbelievable rhinoceros of a Canadian Mountaineer were so well received that experts have described it as" Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs. ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">"it was so well preserved that they could even find that his shoe skin was of reddish, and they said they could have had something from a" "uncomfortable past." "</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the magazine" Current Biology, "described him as" the besterned dinosaurs that was ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs copies of the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">"Fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier, which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period of between 110 million and 112 million years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"its incredibly well preservative condition has researchers, which to describe it as" truly remarkable "flabbergasted"</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic is the armored plant-eater that is best preserved Fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn funk, when he was in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he looked at something which appeared from the surrounding rocks out of the board, and decided to see more accurately."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered that was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to expose the wild animals within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy geography."</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all these hard work the finished product is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you're just a little with the eyes blind, you could almost believe that it has slept", "said the Hauptautor Caleb Brown, scientists at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature has to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter the history of scientists as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs copies, Mona Lisa is the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this crop-eater although it is covered with an armor and resembles a changing armor is likely to be threatened by meat.</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding that is known as counter-ageing, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have been allowed to blend into its environment and soften their enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaurs made the headlines in May and is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Borealopelta marketelli according to the museum techniques Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7,000 hours to discover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for the Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and form of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the countershading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the peak of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the locksmith is usual, the results are surprising, because the size of Borealopelta is by far the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it points out that the dinosaurs has been chased by enough pressure through meat-eating dinosaurs, that evolution encourages the exploitation of the confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most of the contemporary animals that put the counter shading - think of deer, Zebras or Gürteles - are much smaller and hurtless than loot, which signal that these Nodosaurs was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"powerful predatory behaviour on a massive, heavily armored dinosaurs, how dangerous the dinosaurs carnivores of the Cretaceous must have been", "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">Chemical analysis organic compounds in their skins shows also that the skin of the dinosaur is bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to study the animal on information about his life, including its fourth Darmintes in order to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, driven into a river and driven out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea floor."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time Alberta was so warm as South florida today, and rivers and oceans are probably much more widespread than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it is fully covered with preservaged skin, but also retained in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the beast," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost as it is in the early chalk.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need much imagination to use to reconstruct it. if you just have a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that he is alive."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk-time was a time when giant Theropods, carnivorous dinosaur, which stood on two legs, the earth crossed."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, millions years after Borealopelta lived, the armored dinosaurs was hunted by some of his furtive ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose latest findings appear in the Fachmagazine Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta has failed after death in the sea and in mud mumified."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn funk, when he was in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum it is the besterned dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3.000 pounds (1,300 kg). "</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch-long spikes that restores from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores was curved by the Western Canada until a flooded river flooded into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater of the dinosaur preserved its armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The hidden remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains are still bumpy plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as' rare as a profit in lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I see it, the mess it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">"petrified remains of the skin, still cover the bumpy plates that carry the skull of the beast."</seg>

<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year-old child, and it is still on the street," was there. "</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused as no one else on her feed had posted the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly saved on her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the Rapper from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo."</seg>
<seg id="2027">"he poised a picture of navigating lebloous body, which was stretched on the road and would stay there four hours."</seg>
<seg id="2028">"it is wild," "said Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for her and her community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She placed her mobile phone to return later on the evening to tweets on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and the people, the shout, and of a man who claimed that his father said to be a sign with the inscription:" Ferguson police have just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">They observed a live Feed where a policeman is in front of a group of protesters with a dog barking.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, she assured another policeman his rifle and cried," I will kill you... animals all kill you. "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"that is not usual," Ferrell reminds of her testimony. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">That is not the kind of murder that we have accustomed to and which we can call a typical one.</seg>
<seg id="2036">In this moment I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">You booked a flight back and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after the landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets "," in the cinemas from the 11th hour. "</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, of strength and resistance, which consists of the perspective of people living in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter, who took a flower-dress and a suitable crown, went to Ferguson, praises the two a conversation that they had countless times before this morning" about the black experience and the black state. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for that, what they believe in?" she reminded of what she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2044">We now go to Ferguson because the police had killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right.</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take her," said Ferrell later. "</seg>
<seg id="2046">That which is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and will see it and be put up in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do is free to liberate ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have luck to give her an experience in which they personally have no ekeepers racism, it is no different from the next black women."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I feel I would show you a bad service, to keep away from it."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authorities, which became a Campsite as the activists on the possible non-indictment by Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"in there, Ferrell and her daughter had joined with a local business partner."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags in front of and helped to pass them on protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began to accept a new type of activism for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed totally after 9 August," "she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority student Nurses Association and concentrated on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in Organize.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met during an evening-demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the Co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said her and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to document "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came from Ferrell in the sense:" "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can exploit?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"these scepticism has been nourished by countless cases of men, often of whites - in a community that benefited from her pain and its resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently declared:" "we heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson, and did not want to have their voices centered and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had worked together with the former co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field, known for his activism rum in Todestrakt occupants."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought the project closer together, together with six other indigenous peoples followed the team of" Whose Streets "" in the years after Browns. "</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we speak," said Davis. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are presented, as I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to focus on Ferrells' experience - to show that it is not about a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," "said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious student in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferris life, as she loves herself and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I have understood that there must be certain vulnerability at this work and in humanity.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferryells history repeated the role of black gay women in the broader black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, which after killing the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 have shaped the film" "BlackLivesMatter" "in social media, identify themselves as sulul."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in management positions have borne the movement in total," said Ferrell, "and so we are constantly fighting on various fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must carry the main last of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan agreed to note that "the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women.</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it is obvious that" "this is not a affirmativer type of action", "when Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who took this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no coincidence, even though she was on the front line because with a life on these crosses as a black, gay woman is so much at stake."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the news cameras arrived in Ferguson long ago, but the racial links between the church and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on currency for 2 ½ years because of the blockage of a highway in a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "a mess."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, they cled to a song and she feels obliged to this memory, since three years ago she went into Ferguson on the road three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love each other and support.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalahn": TV readers talk about bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit-gallery moves the people even though it is not yet built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a mall at the south end of the pedestrian street splits since the first presentation of 2009 the population in proponents and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">"cold, the subject hardly leaves one."</seg>
<seg id="2092">On our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" the topic will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while one can say to the Bit Gallery," "that would be a dream" "(Anja Becker) or" "that would be really great" "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side," "no human" "(Siggi Betts) or simply simply:" "megalomania" "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the advocates build that a gallery moves more customers into the city, of which the rest of the business will benefit, fear the enemies that then the pedestrian street bleeds."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery will be built exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall stands in which 13 direct marketer products offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">The construction work will be concluded with the start of construction work.</seg>
<seg id="2097">"the gallery macher want to integrate a market hall in the new building, namely to the Beda place, with a way to sitting outside."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"Simone Room:" "we have been driving almost every week in the peasant market for many years."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the landscape are always very happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Even the butcher we have discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">"we would desire that even during and above all after building the gallery, there is an opportunity to maintain this offer."</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also this.</seg>
<seg id="2103">The small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"Gerd Densing:" "whether the marketers market in a market hall in the gallery, comes to the height of the rent."</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, this might not be very low in the new project."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why the Commercial Palace in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find that superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You see how many charges are empty here - some since months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"however, since there is not even a neat weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the Markthalle will remain intact."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there is fresh, mostly offered by the manufacturer and is very inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you see, cargo will be rented in a shopping center only by larger firms, because the local tenants are often not viable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, special stores there are almost no more and what still exists, then will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a mall with a Markthalle that doesn't fit together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit into Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the farmers market place during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the old EDEKA would be the solution - even at the duration, if the bit gallery will actually come."</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it create the specter bit gallery already to drive all shops from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that's just not going to work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which is empty, also no one needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion it would have been better to promote the right farmer's market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a peasant hall, it is thanks to the insane many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg have no place anymore."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the peasant market is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">An appropriate similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces see - white, black and brown, which are almost inconspicuous - that hang on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">"the 30 portraits were made by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Haarlem, which were sent to her by Chelsea Manning."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from the prison of Fort Leavenworth where the former Secret Services analyst gave birth to a 35-year prison sentence, after it publicly trailed diplomatic reports about the WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, A Becoming resemblance (A suitable similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"it is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united its expertise in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering dised, whose condemnation of Barack Obama had been transformed when he had only three days in his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has been extracted from the algorithm analysis of DNA, which could be extracted from Manning, and created out of the 30 portraits, such as someone with these genomic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted, and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, but also to identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has been openly manifested since her puberty, was sentenced in 2013 because of 20 accusations, including six violations against the spy law, computer and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"through the prison its image was suppressed, so much that there was only one single photo - a granny, black-white selfie, in which Manning sits on an elevator and a platonic blonde carries out with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012-project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"it produced the artist portraits of strangers from forensory artifacts such as cible blacks and chewing gum, making the DNA extracted from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press show of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not be visited at that time, and she could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her prisoners were received at an unequal penpal who brought several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created some of the Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic" Suppressed images, "which would predict a future in which the president would convert Chelable verdict and could be able to see the exhibition in person."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in fact, Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Mannings had been calling for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome way of happy meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong, since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the governmental camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to fix the rigid splits that he should actually fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen out of a particular reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in one on the wall of the gallery the artistic statement called Manning with its superlarge signature, among them (the" i "in their family name) is an end to" automatic fragmentation, whose basis gender, race, sexuality and culture have been. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence is a thousandler of Cs and Gs and As, in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the involvement of the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific Lexicon of the artist), as is astonishing, at least in biological terms, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring about it is that our genome does not take care of who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective it is," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, too. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in its own room, is a page from the above mentioned comic-Novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">"it shows Manning, as it appears with a free prechtelefon in the hand of the disciplinarcades of the United States such as King Kong."</seg>
<seg id="2150">"when they say your speech, then they won."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter whom she wrote me," "said the artist, who greeted me from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get goose, when I talk about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not yet seen the exhibition - as it presupplied in the comic book - but if they should do it, then it will be welcomed in the center of space of masks, from their own genomic simulactionists that gather as hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also purposeful, as everything was written in the exhibition until the size (5" "2, Mannings Stature)" in which their genetic Hapilgroups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement, who formed with Chelsea, like the movement that also stuck behind her liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes, based on an archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he unexpectedly found emotionally."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I have only responded to the thumb imprint on the side of a letter, which was written by a double-agent in the 1700-s, who worked for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>

<seg id="2306">"the intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust was only received full access in 2006 when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died."</seg>

<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more frequently," "said Mr Sharkey in publication of his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sexpuppen have developed off their inflatable partners with a Silicone which feels warm to the touch of human reactions which are achieved by the artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also adapt to his robot according to his beliefs, and choose everything from the eye-color of the robot to the shape of the nipples up to the type or the colour of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it is still disturbing, as many robots have the" Personalities "who would look progressively more progressive."</seg>

<seg id="2580">Rotes meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study highlights exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable state, affects approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 300.000, causes stomach cramping and gassiness, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"during those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tryptophan developed by proteins to develop a tolerant intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the guiding researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immuncells in the intestine patrol in the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes hide themselves in the food not penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are capable of dissolving inflammation, are balanced by cells which protect the tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far towards inflammation, it may result in an anti-inflammatory disease. "</seg>
<seg id="2587">"in experiments, it was noted that some kind of tolerance promoting immune cell in mice can be found that carry a particular bacterium in her intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a connection between a bacterial and Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan rich diet promotes tolerant, less anti-inflammatory bounds if the same system also supports people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the postdoktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan sought a kind of immuncell that had found the tolerance as she found out that a group of academic studies had such cells, but another group of the same tribe but had not been separated."</seg>
<seg id="2593">They presumed that the difference has had to do with the intestinal microbial of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract. "</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the cervix of the mice were found DNA sequenced and there were six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells, but without them out of mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were put up in an sterile environment so that they were missing an intestinal microbiome, and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells, and they received the L. reuthi and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how the bacteria used to the immune system, the researchers led L. reuteri in a liquid and then flooded small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on immature immune cells that were isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"as the active component of the fluid, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan-Metabolism known as Indol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"when the researchers double the amount of tryptophan in the food of the mice, the number of such cells increased by approximately 50 percent, but when the tryptophances were halved, the number of cells decreased by the half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice and that most of us are protecting L. reuthi in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri can develop the cells in men as with mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said:" "the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, since these cells control infections on the inner surface of the intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophanous can result in the presence of L. reuthi to an expansion of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Heseman.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The concluding report for misuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen continues for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisger, spokesman of the reformist movement" "We are church," "declared after the publication of the German Press Agency, he who expect from former Regensburg Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeriated Pope Benedict XVI, an apology."</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would be very useful to the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would like to express their deep understanding about their own subyoffs or their wrong assessment of the processes at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican" Osservatore Romano, "on the other hand criticized that in the reporting of force on violence in the domain-cats with" "different measure". ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"the author of Lucetta Scaraffia, historian, and a member of the national Italian bioethics committee," is the author of Lucetta Scaraffia, historians and member of the national Italian bioethics committee. "</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit that denote the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of the day-day experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "one likes to go on to the church and this is a crazy frescoes."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"moreover, she pointed out that in her youth" "strokes a quite normal pedagogical means" "to be done with cheeky children, as I was one, ready to be finished."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it is unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, because the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse, Pope Georg Ratzinger appeared often."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely wrongly, the author and historian Michael Heseman, who was translated with Ratzinger the reminder" My brother of the Pope "(translated in 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protecting," "says Heman," "For all this had nothing to do with him," he adds the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly stands in the 440-page report that was commissioned by Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Rainsburger Domspatzen have been sexually abused between 1945 and early 1990s" "with high Plausisensibility" "victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused"</seg>
<seg id="2905">"at the closing report, it is said to Georg Ratzinger, which was engaged from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg:" in summary, it can be held that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases, physical and psychological violence were applied. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially on high levels of Emotionality the punishment for the students could be disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"in contrast to numerous other allegations, many victims were estimated to attract the general humanity of R., and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview of Heshemann, why the concluding report on the abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger explains his opinion unpaved."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hide, the 440-pages report on the" Incidents "of violence against shelters at the Regensburger Domspatzen" is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger. "</seg>
<seg id="2910">"on the one hand, many students lift up his" "humanity". ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a cholera and perfectionist who became more incomprehensible if a Domspatz was musically no top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate as his biographer this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Heseman: when you get the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the rear, one needs to ask yourself more, why the name Georg Ratzinger at all can be found at all."</seg>
<seg id="2914">It is dedicated just eight pages and it is clearly spoken by any suspicion of the mid- or co-workers in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">"non-violence at the Pre-College was also uneventful outside of its efficiencies."</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can refute him if not too late or have not taken the first hint of it seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzengian gymnasium at which he appeared, was perceived by practically all respondents as - as literally -" redemption "," "Heaven" and "better world." "</seg>
<seg id="2918">"so also the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger presents an excellent testimony," "sincerely," "competent," "competent" and "understanding," as extremely well-natured teachers who catches the guys regularly with cakes, biscuits and bonons and "always accompanied by grapes grown by children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority is complained about its Perfectionism and its high levels of emotive that also lead to sweep.</seg>
<seg id="2920">"he did not only cast it with chairs and cast the keychain on the ground, but also called ear solemies on the hair or ears, he himself gave herself many years ago, deeply regretted and excused for that."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, to his honor, however, it must be said that such educators were widespread in the questionable period, the 1960s and 1970s, as well as parents such as teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us, who was born in 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a worldly school, a state-Gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what it is actually going on in this report, namely expirreplaceable sexual abuse and violence at the preschool, these are certainly dreadels."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"you ask yourself, whether it is not more likely to do with his acquaintance and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media has just crashed onto him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"at the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him still diligently."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relaying Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, the report was reported much about the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger will also be placed in the final report or co-workers with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Heseman: very much no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No single of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have become familiar to the domain master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never saw myself to talk to my father or mother over it," "said a person concerned for the others," "It was all very embarrassing for me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with clarification of sexual abuse was and is that most victims of shame silence.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they do not even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir manager, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrator."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen student Ratzinger's role in regard to the abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Heseman: a respondent student formulate it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he had had (Georg Ratzinger) had been timely and could have had the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for truly absurd, to accept that they have just opened it... boars more pressing or clearer or even more likely to have opened as compared to their parents, internats, trust teachers, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you speak to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"thus, the report comes to the very clear result:" that the pupils and / or their environment trusted, could not be confirmed in the context of the examination. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"regarding sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is therefore released from every fellow-learning."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"so it cannot be thrown out, not prevented him or brought it to the display."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"hence, there is no reason to bring his good name to these diswardly crime as it was unfortunately in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media was much of "non-violence" during the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger will be thrown away in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Must he live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Heseman: this is the big problem that in the reporting everything has been mixed and mixed to a huge melange of sexual abuse and non-violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"yet, exactly this is a misuse of the report."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, it is clean separately: between the primary school and the gymnasium of the cathedral-cats, between sexual abuse and violence, we say once, other anticipation."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report incidents have been treated from the time since 1945, so also for four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral of the domain cats."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole dreadful pedagogy pedagogy, the cases in which the child of sadist teachers were literally layered and malignant, unrained on the preschool of Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to be taken."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with those who had nothing to do with them, Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he had got the boys to face as she was already on the Domspatzengian gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">This was how most witnesses emphasise the topic of "Pre-School" tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2955">"we were only happy to be escaped, and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even" "heavenly". ""</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatzengian gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Heseman: there was a discipline, but not a sadist violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that" many victims were estimated by R. R., and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">That is at the most still the reproach to have taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"however, despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods of time, in which it was reported by the states on the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71 when he started to establish themselves and was in charge of the events at a school where he was not involved and responsible, (so the witness) wanted nothing, and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger ended in front of the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Heseman: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengian gymnasium which the report was even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this, he points out that in the preschool will continue to practice the test penalty."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"already in the face of the danger of negative press public, he recommended urgent action."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"of course, this was of course at a time when legal clarity was passed, as examinations were also recently prohibited in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they occurred in a legal gravation zone, just like any one of us probably knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was hard to estimate for him, where the person might be exaggerated or dramatic, and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">But it can also not be said he would have always looked at hand.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the results of schools were officially abolished in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis asserted that it is unfair to apply today's educational standards at the time of time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Heseman: we historians talk about the" "pitfalls of Anachronism", "i.e. the danger of evaluating the past in today's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this does not apply to sexual abuse which had been abominable at all times, and also not for what was rooted in the preschool of adversity and violence to innocent child shrimps, that goes far beyond that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"this is all so terrible, and I am glad that it is finally applied."</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protecting; for all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means for disciplining and punishment, thus earnest and ears to pull together were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then forbidden, he has also strictly kept it in it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"which picture from his Regensburger Zeit has Georg Ratzinger, because in the talks with you for the book" My brother of Pope "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of investigating also for speech?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Heseman: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, because the cathedral-cats played only one side."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I am not at all ashamed that he led a strict regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even that must be said once again: without these Perfectionism, without the asking for unconditionally discipline, it would hardly have been possible to form an institution of world transcrig, true cultural boties in Europe and his musical tradition, which went to tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and bonons alone you make no big singers and stand before any success, right in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of man did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Heseman: through working on the book and in addition I met Georg Ratzinger really well over and over again as wonderful, humorous, inferous, deep-believing and savage good people, from which one could not imagine that he could do just a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I get regularly with how many former estates are still today, 23 years after his Emeriding, regularly contact him to visit him - he is almost blind - and to treat him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who have not forgiven him up to this day, that he once was strictly speaking to them, are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"most domain cats are grateful to him today, that he has enriched their lives and put them into the world of music."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he always was a good, paternal teacher - a stringent father, certainly, that may be - but also a likeable respect, to which they still look up and honor them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clearly: all that one casts to him are educators, who were then on the agenda at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have recently overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is highly unjust, a man, only because he is prominently and has a more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intention that stands behind it, just too apparent."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just released, relieved him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now it would have acquired a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany no one would probably know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
