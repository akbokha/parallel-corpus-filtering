Jennifer An@@ iston : I will always put in drawers
Jennifer An@@ iston must not always be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star in an interview now un@@ ambig@@ uous .
&quot; I am always put into the drawers or get absorbed by the outside label , who have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
&quot; I myself do not have the desire , always perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; honestly , these things are rather schn@@ u@@ ppe . &quot;
Jennifer An@@ iston ( 47 ) can only laugh that they are called &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as they declared in the current Cos@@ m@@ opolitan magazine .
&quot; the actress spends her time at home , pre @-@ TV with lo@@ cker@@ em Dut@@ t and Mexican food , it is stated in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; they bring the question about the child &apos;s desire : &quot; &quot; we must not be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; says Hollywood Star . &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s game &quot; is An@@ iston as an all@@ er@@ ating mother of two sons to see .
the film runs with us from August 25 .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tur@@ ni@@ ers in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger looked up with some colleagues a little variation with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses rec@@ alled their holidays , they troubled in the fast gal@@ lop at home to the feeding . &quot;
&quot; a few kilometers at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and that ended the equ@@ est@@ rian care@@ ers then again .
&quot; on Saturday , Germany was the best gol@@ fers of all time - 101 tournament coverage - again near horses . &quot;
&quot; he sat down with his family on the grounds of the AL@@ RV , on a horse sw@@ ang it not even to photo@@ sets . &quot;
this long was the first time in Aachen and therefore also with CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German Spor@@ thilfe passed the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small gala the Golden Sport@@ pyram@@ ide .
&quot; on awards , it lacks the lik@@ able athlete . &quot;
&quot; Concer@@ t@@ win@@ z , silver Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already told him .
the 18th pri@@ ze@@ winner of the sport pyramid .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans GÃ¼nter Win@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; for it is not only awarded for sporty achievements but also for social commitment . &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger encourages the offspring .
&quot; and so he gave the prize money to 25,000 Euro just as well . &quot;
&quot; with 15 more outstanding sports@@ men , the triple Master@@ s@@ si@@ eger was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of Fame of Fame of German Sports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the recorded marks are the Athle@@ tics Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , who Turner Eber@@ hard , the Ru@@ cian Peter Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the Spring@@ ver Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the Spring@@ pioneer Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ eh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the hand@@ ball . &quot;
many of these sports enthusiasts had come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part the illustr@@ e society emig@@ rated to the Spring@@ stadium where the Lav@@ az@@ za price ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held distance to the big animals .
Cl@@ int@@ ons and Tru@@ mp@@ s economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent trade agreement T@@ TP - that want to both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
&quot; unfortunately , the two US presidential competition were however at the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question . &quot;
&quot; differences in the economic policy of Donald Tru@@ mp and Hill@@ ary Clinton lies a fundamental , more philosophical difference . &quot;
the role of the state .
Tru@@ mp wants to keep in doubt rather small in doubt and warned about how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton than@@ ked the economy to death and regul@@ ate death , he says . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he himself would be quite different , says Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely back regul@@ ators , and it makes strong tax reform with lower control units strong - for private people and for businesses . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , Clinton says : the state has certain duties to open , he has disadvantaged opportunities to open and need money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes for the rich would increase , says it . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Tru@@ mp and Clinton say almost wor@@ e . &quot;
the Democratic candidate certainly announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state investment programs into the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are refused by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apart@@ y @-@ wing of the Re@@ public@@ ans .
&quot; therefore , on Tru@@ mp there could be a non @-@ parti@@ san discussion . &quot;
evident are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal power plants and rebuild the coal mining operation in the USA .
oil @-@ mining should also be possible in so far protected areas to announce the Paris mi@@ tigation agreement .
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton wants to expand and demands the renewable energy programme with its investment program : &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; however , not only with infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not far away from each other . &quot;
&quot; t@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ on@@ fish trade agreement , do not want to sign both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both do not want to isol@@ ate the U.S. from international trade - but simply to protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; the should then also be paid better then , for about Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tru@@ mp is going to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must , then he says , he should not be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to become more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tru@@ mp stands for the economy and the citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics keep him in front of him , that the budget defic@@ it would only be greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least ask from the rich , that they pay more taxes and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence belongs to women , who alone escape , almost already for everyday life . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen sitting four women .
each one has a baby with me at most one year old .
one has placed her little son in the arm .
he w@@ akes with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother for@@ ks at the table@@ top .
until they noticed that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until you speak to Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the Executive Officer of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier of social aid agencies in Bavaria , and deals with the topic of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for all women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs has made up the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich &apos;s Aid .
&quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : any woman who arrives here has made her flight experience with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men will flee for wars because they are politically per@@ secuted , because they send torture or death because their families send them to Europe as a hope for hope . &quot;
women over@@ weigh other reasons for escape : &quot; many are secre@@ tly aware of it because they do not see any other way out .
&quot; they have experience in their home country with sexual violence , compul@@ sion , hon@@ orary , slavery or co@@ er@@ pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this is what drives them away .
on the run it goes further .
&quot; that tu@@ gs call for example for a bottle of water a sexual act is no rarity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
and the women are alone ; they are not protected by their families .
&quot; who believe that the end as soon as they ank@@ le in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; also here , women in refugee camps were often seen as inf@@ erior and worse . &quot;
&quot; this leads to that about 90 percent of women who live in the residence in the Munich north , trau@@ mati@@ zed them . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntarily created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women were so accu@@ stom@@ ed to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experiences , because the shame is too great . &quot;
&quot; because they often fail to help him , no more accommodations need only for them , calls B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven districts governing plants are in charge of the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; to the question whether they knew from a similar project like in Munich in its jurisdiction , some are responding to no . &quot;
&quot; in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz region and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is no such thing in accommodations of the governments . &quot;
&quot; even in Schw@@ aben alone , women were not separated alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Pres@@ ses@@ on the Government . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are some floors of floors , or own houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Dut@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations for women . &quot;
also the committee &quot; rights of the women and gender equality &quot; committee in the European Parliament is calling for women to be separated from men .
&quot; in a study that was published for the Committee , says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot;
&quot; lacks the privacy or become women and women together , it can lead to - perpet@@ ual violence against women . &quot;
especially the washing rooms should be separated and accessible to women in the study .
&quot; how much the women feel this protected area , one can read by the rush that there is to the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since she has spoken around that there is us , we have a long queue , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily set up a second house .
assistance of assist@@ ants : demands for new work@@ aro@@ unds
&quot; the deputy of assist@@ ants have called for a call , new labour @-@ ups in their disputes relating to a new contract . &quot;
&quot; the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has demanded his entire Council , from the beginning of September more workers . &quot;
&quot; the J@@ DC said that the ministers were desp@@ ised , to respond to the concerns relating to the contract . &quot;
&quot; assistant doctors and medical students have agreed on the rejection of a contract in July , which was agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Twitter , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; persistent &quot; to have problems , which resulted in the contract was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The J@@ DC executive committee voted to fully reject the proposed new contract and is concerned with official new negotiations for all of their worries . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government the J@@ DC executive committee today asked a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to have a running program escal@@ ating work , which begins at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the dispute resulted in that assist@@ ants in the year 18@@ sm@@ al strike , the first total sei@@ zur@@ es in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the head of the BM@@ A Assist@@ ants Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came back after the elections to rejection of the agreed contractual conditions , which were recommended by BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he divided BM@@ A members during the meetings that were held before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 assist@@ ants and physicians , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Minister Jerem@@ y H@@ unt said that the contract for physicians should be introduced in England . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance between out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended up a crisis .
&quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce the hands and proclaim an official end to the eight months of continued war , and economic sanctions . &quot;
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gold @-@ pl@@ ated hall of St. Peter@@ s@@ burger Palace in receiving , I cannot rep@@ el this reconciliation in most . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s sm@@ iles appeared narrow and he had a little heat off , even for his with@@ standing conditions . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , said to his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a review all five times . &quot;
I could no longer count .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even better to improve . &quot;
the next day was a newspaper that Erdo@@ gan had heard so ben@@ gan as if never had any worst happen .
I seemed to see his enthusiasm more on the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin be@@ aming , sustainable ch@@ asti@@ le showed that the president of Russia had nothing to forget . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tions : the down@@ ing of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border with Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was w@@ ut@@ ated .
Putin divided and accused Ankara to please Russia into the back .
the failure was even bigger since it was done by a alleged friend .
the pul@@ ses will rebuild again if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; months long , the nation@@ ally controlled media led a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
at once it seemed that the Turks would blame for all the debts .
&quot; the serious officials were the alleg@@ ations of guiding officials that Erdo@@ gan had benef@@ ited their family from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
&quot; however , in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology from the President Erdo@@ gan who he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia was able to win a sort of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a c@@ eas@@ e@@ fire are clearly on hand . &quot;
&quot; Erdo@@ gan mainly requires all the friends who can get , after spending last month in a failed coup d almost his Am@@ tes . &quot;
repeated terror attacks on Turkey also shaken him shaken .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - particularly the pro@@ hibition of charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot;
the number is decreased by nearly 90 % .
travel agencies and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are being resum@@ ed .
they are counting on a bel@@ ated ons@@ lau@@ ght on the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; this week predicted the TV exp@@ elled , cheap fruits and vegetables , as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imported once again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti form@@ ulate it as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an extra political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West since it has been seen as a weak answer to the tried .
&quot; to do this , the ongoing gru@@ dge through the snow emp@@ owerment of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the er@@ pi@@ ke is to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; at Ankara , Russian state leader won a bonus for ensuring that he tried to seek support for the elected state organs . &quot;
this is well @-@ evident for Moscow . self @-@ evident that itself has a profound fear of reg@@ im@@ ents itself .
&quot; the summit in this glorious palace made it possible for Russia and Turkey , one as described to me an an@@ alysts once described , &quot; &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; : two countries that feel embarrass@@ ed from the West and are poorly treated . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in spite of the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave itself the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey are opposed to opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be indic@@ ative that after nearly three hours of first talks , both pres@@ idents at the press conference said that they could not even stri@@ ped on the subject . &quot;
the President of Turkey gu@@ ed it inten@@ tionally to answer a question about their differences while Putin decided to emphasize this .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found to Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disc@@ aster , as NATO member Turkey took off the Russian combat jet - it certainly is better that the two leaders at least once again talk . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland is no longer available
the R@@ BS brand should be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the head of head of the Bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan divided the BBC Scotland with that the R@@ BS brand affiliated with the global ambitions of the bank .
the Bank has since dist@@ ancing itself since eight years ago and almost had to be res@@ cu@@ ed .
&quot; in this time , bran@@ ding strateg@@ ist &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; uses to protect other end @-@ scale finance brands . &quot;
&quot; it supported international sport with millions of pounds ( sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray . &quot;
but now she has decided to put more national brands into the focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the main headquarters and the stock exchange will switch to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other smaller brands for individuals who are more meaning - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; he divided the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the RS@@ B brand will be employed in our investment brand as well as to the brand , under which our employees will be employed , as we are becoming more of a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say now that we don &apos;t have any global targets , but local goals . &quot;
each of these marks will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees are working among the customers these marks .
R@@ BS has already stated that his Six Nations Sponsor@@ ship will no longer be sustained and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of different brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of brands because how do we focus on inside ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the leader . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal for three years ago , if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and laun@@ ches these brands . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can restore these marks again , so I think that the time has come . &quot;

Russian Vladimir Putin &apos;s chief of leader Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has released its staff leader Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of the nar@@ ro@@ gated trust of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as special commissioned for environmental and transportation .
&quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , it is said Putin without giving reasons &quot; the dism@@ iss@@ al Ivan@@ ov@@ s of his duties as chairman of the Russian government administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been representative since 2012 Ivan@@ ov@@ s , was appointed as his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital , Tallinn , he graduated from the renowned State of Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it is ( in Russian ) that he later was the leader and chief of the government officer .
about his appointment he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
&quot; I am reminded that it is the most important task of the government to support its activities as head of state , and support controls for the implementation of your instructions . &quot;
&quot; Putin shared the Russian TV broad@@ cast@@ er on Friday , that Ivan@@ ov asked for his posts to leave and V@@ ain@@ o as his successor . &quot;
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was for a long time one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putin &apos;s and works as he works for the Soviet Intelligence Service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as a staff of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , who was broadcast on television , both men claimed to leave his staff at his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , here are only a few of them convinced - especially right now before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so here is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
this is at present no one .
&quot; but the official statement - that a man who once tou@@ ted as a potential president , would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - came across great scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his comments on Putin who quoted on the website of the Krem@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - compl@@ ain@@ able post for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been Chairman of the Russian Presidency for the past four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
&quot; previously , he was deputy prime minister and Minister of Defence . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin became a member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , which replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy . &quot;
&quot; as Putin , he came to power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , whom he was familiar with the most . &quot;
&quot; once , Ivan@@ ov went to Putin &apos;s second term president of Russia as a third term Putin &apos;s coup would have rejected the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , next ally Put@@ ins , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became prime minister before he became president of three and a half years later .
among Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gibson was fired after he has been offering a producer
Gibson was involved in a physical examination at the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
&quot; ABC studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , proclaimed in a common opinion its dism@@ iss . &quot;
&quot; Gibson , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his dism@@ iss . &quot;

&quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot;
&quot; details of how the character Gib@@ bs from the series , which follows a team of F@@ BI agents , will be released , according to the opinion of ABC studios and C@@ BS Television Studios are expected to be released at a later date . &quot;

ri@@ ddles to fish who landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a population of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish aid who appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
&quot; Kevin B@@ ain thinks that it could act with the 75 f@@ ishings for sand@@ a@@ ale , which were separated from a fountain . &quot;
&quot; Mr. B@@ ain , who lives around 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone might throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot;
Queens@@ bor@@ sing Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the Â£ 1,@@ 35 billion expensive project should be completed by May 2017
engineers have linked the northern deck of the Queens@@ bor@@ sings with the vi@@ adu@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four gates of the &quot; &quot; Deck@@ b@@ lower &quot; , &quot; which opens the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
the br@@ isk section of Fi@@ fe is 600 meters long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 tons of concrete . &quot;
the Â£ 1,@@ 35 billion expensive project should be completed by May 2017 . &quot;
&quot; today , Wirtschafts@@ Minister Keith Brown appointed a visit today and was one of the first to proc@@ eeded from the land on the bridge . &quot;
he said : &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment on the construction of the Queens@@ bor@@ etum .
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30.000 tonnes of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the flow between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot;
&quot; a total of nearly 79 % of the total br@@ do@@ cks in their place and the last section of the decoder gets today in Ros@@ y@@ th for the deck , meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first application is a significant milestone in each bridge project . &quot;
with this fantastic project the closure @-@ oriented high @-@ level and deep @-@ construction .
&quot; after installing the last block of the street and the connection with the Nord@@ Tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the still existing gap on the north side of the North or Land@@ mark . &quot;
this was reached by pulling the northern Zu@@ br@@ inger@@ bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and at the same time very tricky activity .
&quot; massive since the vi@@ adu@@ ct 2@@ 22 meter long is , approx . 6,000 tons , and had to be drawn up from approx . 3 % to the top . &quot;
&quot; heal , since the toler@@ ances , on which the team works , were tiny - on each side they were just a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men still have good fortune to be alive &quot;
&quot; three men have &quot; &quot; happiness still alive &quot; &quot; after they were thrown off by their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI life@@ station suggested on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alert after an crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulty going to swim in security , while their boat moved from their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around in around and placed the worst in front of us , &quot; &quot; said the leader of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already left the boat except their reach , until we left water , he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , whereas the third man was exhausted aged 60 and at one bo@@ per without li@@ f@@ life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all arrived on board the coastal road boat and were brought back to the li@@ f@@ ebo@@ at station
&quot; Mr. Jones said , &quot; &quot; The three men who were cast into the water was fortunate to be un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boot engine had a sti@@ p@@ board , though , however , this ext@@ ingu@@ ished at the con@@ gestion of the bo@@ ots of the person who controls the boat . &quot;
someone has known today about these men today .
badly injured - man sti@@ cks to his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and badly injured .
&quot; as the police were running yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to pick up his personal things . &quot;
&quot; instead , the non @-@ alcoholic perpetr@@ ator cr@@ ushed the clothes of his ex @-@ friend . &quot;
&quot; when this came into the apartment , he went twice to her . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured on hand and on the body .
the police could take the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old the clothing of his ex @-@ friend destroyed , he called his mother . &quot;
this al@@ armed then became his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm their brother . &quot;
&quot; however , it could not move him to leave the apartment . &quot;
&quot; therefore , they went out of the house with her companions . &quot;
&quot; on the street , they met the ex @-@ companion of the man . &quot;
&quot; as the two women were che@@ ating the apartment again , the bar@@ ley of the 50 @-@ year @-@ old his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ friend . &quot;
who builds Braunschweig &apos;s cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens mean : investors should be much stronger in the future . &quot;
how do you react to bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 favorable apartments in the coming years ?
&quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; action concept &quot; &quot; to the next council session . &quot;
but argument is programmed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation has been lacking .
&quot; SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann writes : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas in the future , it must show 20 percent of all the apartments as a social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments are also available in the continu@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; but the large part of the town hall is , as Brat@@ un@@ mann : &quot; &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to make at least 10 per cent , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments build as social housing as much as possible . &quot;
&quot; a new municipal housing construction programme , which will cost millions of costs and is still to be financed by incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , as Brat@@ un@@ mann : &quot; &quot; there is still no agreement between the Grou@@ ps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors possible as few regulations as possible .
the left still wants to be hardness of investors .
&quot; regardless , as Brat@@ un@@ mann , a ti@@ ghtening of the situation is on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; the action concept is implemented , which will provide for additional tasks in the building administration . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; but the program does not yet exist : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how does one balances the loss of other around 1300 cheap apartments , which will end up in the coming years ? &quot;
&quot; only by 2020 , there will be 500 apartments alone . &quot;
&quot; to prevent this , so the plan@@ atory spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , should now be bought out @-@ out ties of the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought to bring apartments back to the price . &quot;
this is possible in the western town .
put on a blow to solve the problem .
because in the western town the end of the year is walking .
approximately 1800 apartments you could get there back to the price of cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners to housing housing companies .
&quot; because the number of social housing in the west city increases dramatically , one gets away from the goal of the so @-@ called mixture . &quot;
a concentration of social weak in just a few parts of the city shall not be able to give it any more .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there is still movement in the discussion .
&quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke thinks : &quot; &quot; for a vast majority the CD@@ U needs to go into the boat . &quot;
one concentrated on more places for one @-@ family dwell@@ ings .
but what does not mean that not yet a compromise can be found .
&quot; Po@@ k@@ Ã©@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it &apos;s fascinating to watch how the world changes .
&quot; that teenagers and child can no longer go outside , but rather prefer their free time to spend their leisure time , on screens , was absorbed in the last decade of many lam@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; at Po@@ k@@ emon Go , it is about getting people out of the couch and be more active . &quot;
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the television , then video games and last on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and activities are not mutually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; naturally I refer to the Po@@ k@@ Ã©@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app , based on the characters , first created for vide@@ og@@ ames in the 199@@ 0@@ ies ( later the drawing series arose , game cards and other spin @-@ off ) . &quot;
&quot; as many phenomena of pop culture , the interest in the release of the game in the U.S. , Australia and New Zealand have something in the beginning of July . &quot;
the launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that the server was la@@ wed .
&quot; within a few days , Po@@ k@@ Ã©@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players with their smartphone go outside and search for Po@@ k@@ Ã©@@ mons , which are tr@@ acked with a GPS and once they have been found once , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screenshot on the phone ) or &quot; captured &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was still younger , joined the W@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person goes back every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , the 3@@ 5.000 users pursued the Washington Post recently concluded that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of subsequent folks that train every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Po@@ k@@ Ã©@@ mon Go - it merely looks the raw data to enhance efficiency .
&quot; many public education campaigns for health , people want to take &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes of time &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; coming from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to be active every day , because many public messages are getting boring and come from people coming . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be over@@ valued . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drives sports , reduces its chances to suffer from cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits , which is too long to guide them here . &quot;
&quot; but the wonder@@ full amount of Po@@ k@@ Ã©@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open , making them fun . &quot;
&quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun . &quot;
some people close the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
&quot; as always , there is also m@@ Ã¼r@@ g@@ ous gameplay , who always have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what should it be ?
it has been a breakthrough .
&quot; even if smartphone apps have already been able to follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to exercise sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be rep@@ lic@@ ated with time .
&quot; however , due to Po@@ k@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success it will give more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and will help many people on the hunt , active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ tower
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jump @-@ horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the floor .
on board the line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympi@@ ad .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for multi@@ plying title and increased the gap between themselves and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly in front of the Silver med@@ all@@ ists and &apos; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ es@@ sk@@ amer@@ ad@@ in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze @-@ winning Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; the American Simone Bil@@ es presents on the pig @-@ bal@@ ks during the single @-@ part of the women at the Olympic Summer Festival in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ a is the fourth hetero@@ sexual Americ@@ an@@ erin , who wins a multi @-@ edge title and overall the fifth , while she soli@@ di@@ fies its reputation , the best of its generation or even at all . &quot;
she broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey in that moment found an end .
this success puts them in the same league for as unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps who have brought their sports to new heights :
&quot; Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years of her sport , 15 World medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympi@@ ad of 1984 Mary Lou re@@ ton of her said that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast that I have ever seen . &quot;
&quot; she expected her last test in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the American Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace herself after they have won gold and silver in the individual majority of women at the Olympic Summer 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while on the departure of the retirement party , they served as retirement @-@ ordin@@ ator , Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as the ru@@ ber@@ mark . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insisted , during their long journeys to the top , never the future is planned , this is not really true . &quot;
part of its ground exercises - which included their typical tum@@ bling pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit at home outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
it is not a coincidence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by Train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school trip to the gym , in which Bo@@ or@@ man tra@@ ded , became power . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , it has no more lost competition , a si@@ mmer series that will keep as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even when Must@@ af@@ ina was easily led by two hu@@ bs , the image ble@@ ached the picture . &quot;
Swe@@ des and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ nen - in which Bil@@ es the world title holds - lau@@ ded .
she again brought up again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the pig and sat down with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ gged her gently when she was expecting her En@@ der@@ lo@@ unger - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flowing to Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision that once was described in their collective @-@ book , to reality . &quot;
&quot; the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a ven@@ ge@@ ance for the last time four years ago , when she fought the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old teams had called &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; , &quot; a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her soil exercise she threw up the audience of Kus@@ sh@@ on , overwhelmed by a com@@ eback that was sometimes dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as far as it concerns , the fast @-@ wide twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old is quite a new meaning at the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims in mass mur@@ der@@ ers when listening in the music
&quot; according to police report that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot , killed in one of the most deadly attacks for a decade in the first series of mass mur@@ der@@ ers while they stopped in the car and heard music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June while the car was par@@ ked during a trip , said the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the perpetrators made eight shots from a hand @-@ fire weapon , while he stood on the passenger side of the car , and then fled afterwards with another vehicle , is in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police shared with that the triple murder had not been the result of a rob@@ bery of predat@@ ors , as the att@@ acker does not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which were in possession of any of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the police officer of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting for investig@@ ators had promised to take a closer look at it , whether it is connected to four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; altogether , mainly in Hisp@@ anic settlements in nine months , seven people were killed and two have been injured . &quot;
&quot; it is done in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , &quot; shared by K@@ BS , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ant from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
&quot; the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence that they have resulted in conclusion that the attacks are linked , and committed by the same mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Ellis , 33 , was born on account of their wounds and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness of the police with that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which resulted in an empty pick@@ up truck with a half hour before the three @-@ fold murder and turned out that it was the work of the Seri@@ al mur@@ ders . &quot;
investig@@ ators found Pat@@ rons and safest a bul@@ let from the seat as well as pu@@ ffer fragments from the engine .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ year with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old loves Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to the singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the least of its anti@@ quity , Edmund micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during their pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home the first time was my first thought , I managed not . &quot;
I do not create it .
I did not let myself .
&quot; what is not true at all -- of course , one has taken care of it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; her husband Vincent and her has been told that Edmund they may never be recognized , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institu@@ tion@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer to this was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Edmund you can run with the help of a wal@@ ker .
Edmund could neither sit nor craw@@ l up to his third year of age and he cannot talk .
but he slowly makes progress .
it can run with support and biking .
he loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; Elizabeth shows the drawing language that Edmund for &quot; &quot; Please sing to me something &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him drawing language with &quot; , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical drawing language -- says it . Edmund has invented some characters alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as well as seals as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the decorative Coron@@ avirus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the coron@@ avirus inf@@ ant .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to reminds of the emotional price of a certain future .
I asked constantly what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t know .
I haven &apos;t been asked for the progn@@ osis for a long time because I do not expect it to tell me someone really .
&quot; but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hope@@ ful advice for mothers of infants with birth @-@ threads , caused by the coron@@ avirus . &quot;
it gets better .
they know that it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; fierce rainfall , floods offer cause for b@@ ail@@ out in Louisiana , Mississippi &quot;
&quot; heavy rainfall and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Louisiana forced the governor about it , on Friday the staff was created , and it is expected to get over the whole Saturday with more rainfall . &quot;
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast Lou@@ is@@ anas and the south of the village , floo@@ ded off their banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme rainfall , reported the National Weather Service . &quot;
&quot; the governor of Louisiana John B@@ el Edwards divided , that state officials were standing in constant contact with local authorities and on the way to the affected municipalities are already underway . &quot;
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , shared with that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags . &quot;
ste@@ ad said that alone the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a had requested a thousand sand@@ bags .
a floo@@ d@@ war@@ n@@ system is used over wide parts in the south Lou@@ is@@ anas until Saturday .
weather @-@ service provided sil@@ ently that there may be additional 3 to 5 inches in the area in this area .
&quot; in the south of Alabama , on Friday there was a Fl@@ ut@@ ch maintenance system , while it continues to be ra@@ ining in the area of Mobile . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Louisiana , will be able to reach all probability following the weekend record . &quot;
the Me@@ ter@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could floo@@ ded many houses in the subur@@ ds near Bat@@ on Rouge .
&quot; he also said that a stro@@ lling downhill in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , since these over the driven rivers are slowly to flow into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the River ti@@ ck@@ w , south of the Mississippi River border in Liverpool , Louisiana , reached on Friday already at 09.@@ 00 the highest state ever recorded . &quot;
rescue team still strug@@ gled from the floo@@ d@@ water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the Sou@@ thwest of Mississippi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , which is greatly increased by night . &quot;
he told him to have given him a step@@ son that lives nearby .
&quot; we are awake and the water flow and flowing in , &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife said Hans@@ ford , that she lived in the 48 years in which she lived there , never seen such a high level of the river . &quot;
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members have had all the disabled and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that Not@@ hel@@ pers had res@@ cu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next lake guard in Glo@@ ster where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floods had spread &quot; fast &quot; as it continues to have heavy rainfall , and that the authorities take into consideration for ev@@ acu@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer close to Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inch of rain . &quot;
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil has been significantly reduced by the rains since Wednesday .
&quot; the authorities en@@ su@@ ed that heavy rainfall and road floo@@ ded the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a Par@@ ish and instruction , caused in five bor@@ ou@@ ghs . &quot;
the C@@ BS @-@ subsidiary WW@@ L reported that an assem@@ bling in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a 200 floo@@ ded houses ang@@ ab .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches that were now both floo@@ ded .
the prer@@ og@@ er of the community Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had 72 people and seven P@@ ets which were r@@ ins@@ ulated by the floods .
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , Not@@ arri@@ vals have been established to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot;
&quot; once the water starts to return , they will go back to their homes , &quot; he said . &quot;
in the city of Ham@@ mond the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a became closed almost two stain@@ ed streets due to the floo@@ d@@ water and sand@@ bags made for the residents to co @-@ measure that hope to keep the water out of their houses and stores .
&quot; the last great floods we had , was in March , &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to become a similar incident .
&quot; in the pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Count@@ ys said that it continues on the golf coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his data , a handful of houses will be reported on Thursday as floo@@ ded , but on Friday there were no reported . &quot;
&quot; Keith Town@@ son , Manager at Sh@@ op@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , lives in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places where I never seen it before , &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 &quot; &quot; of bul@@ lets &quot; , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police shares that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy has been shot in Philadelphia , this week it is already the second time that a 6 @-@ year child is shot . &quot;
the grandparents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grandparents gave him that Brown suffered several treasures , including in the lo@@ ins , leg , arm and belly , but that he was with his transport to the hospital in consciousness . &quot;
&quot; he had done a lot , his small body was sol@@ dered by bul@@ lets , shared his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ inda on the transmitter . &quot;
I simply cannot believe it .
the condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the family of the boy shared the transmitter with that he is expected to recover again .
he would have planned to begin the first class in a local elementary school .
Brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
&quot; likewise , three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
one of the 29 @-@ year men is in the critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in stable condition .
&quot; the boy was found on the front of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is found in a critical state , reported on the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police were determined whether one of the injured men of the perpetrators could be found .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia with that apparently there was a de@@ fire between several arch@@ ers .
&quot; pat@@ ron@@ age for storm rif@@ les , which were trac@@ ed to various assault rif@@ les , over@@ looked the scene . &quot;
it seems that this clearly speaks a permanent struggle in this context .
&quot; on the street , on both sides of the walk , there were leg@@ m . &quot;
&quot; in this way there seems to have been several armed fighters , which were very active involved , &quot; divided into the police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di , police in Philadelphia . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles hit in the area .
&quot; there was no feast , and the police now checks reports according to the surveillance video . &quot;
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a sque@@ ez@@ ebox on the arm when she played in front of her house in the West O@@ ak Lane in front of her house .
she recovered and the police still looks for a susp@@ ects .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
this is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Olympi@@ ad in Tur@@ nen and that for more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have been at each summer Olymp@@ ics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second , this team has three turtles , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspir@@ ational for many young girls of other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the JÃ¼@@ din is and Madison Ko@@ cian , the cath@@ o@@ lic , ab@@ round , makes every pride . &quot;
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has paved the black and Hisp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was one of the female turtles an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
it shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympi@@ ad and America che@@ ered .
&quot; now the world was able to witness the unbelievable performance of the three @-@ fold World Championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as she was unexpected , but master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ as@@ tics rout@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Simone was the fourth , hetero@@ sexual American , who won gold at an individual pay@@ roll event for women gold . &quot;
Mann@@ es@@ member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are witn@@ essing the tip of this sport but so do not look at turn@@ around throughout the country .
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , stroke all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison to create it into the oly@@ mp@@ ic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; last five &quot; &quot; because the next Olymp@@ ics will only have four turtle within the team . besides , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks like this is a dear@@ er sport and Turner first and foremost in private trainers , which are maintained by parents responsible for training , furn@@ ishing , travel and hotel cost ( for the trainer and their Turner and families ) . &quot;
the majority of those trainers are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support business .
&quot; in these verses , Turner was obtaining their complete training and that is for families a expensive and long @-@ term commitment . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , Train@@ ers of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , Train@@ ers of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both her athletes since they started with the tur@@ bine . &quot;
&quot; we have to be inspired to the churches of the inn@@ um@@ erable , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more powerful and more accessible trainers . &quot;
I have established my turn@@ around 20 years ago .
we have free and affordable turmo@@ il in Harlem for more than 15@@ ,000 urban young people ( especially black and Hisp@@ anic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality Tur@@ ns that make the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great oly@@ mp@@ ic sport . &quot;
&quot; develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as training and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , bringing thousands of young girls to be interested in the turmo@@ il and that is great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in the sport , especially for girls . &quot;
it is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this genuine portra@@ yal of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the oly@@ mp@@ ic Mann@@ es@@ gol@@ ds and thanks , F@@ ass motiv@@ ates her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assist@@ ants want to organise further strikes after they have rejected Jerem@@ y H@@ unts suggestion
&quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes made by acceptance of a re@@ formed agreement with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7,@@ 000 assist@@ ants who voted for him to vote . &quot;
H@@ unt plans was un@@ vei@@ led to introduce the contract to introduce the contract and said that the N@@ HS had found itself in a &quot; no land &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful .
&quot; the first assistant doctors have to receive a new contract , the changes to night and weekends work to improve care of the times . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the president of the BM@@ A Com@@ mentary teas for assist@@ ants shared last night in a communication with : &quot; assistant doctors have led to the proposed treaty since before serious concerns , in particular that it is married to the current occup@@ ant crisis and it is admin@@ istered to treat all the doctors . &quot;
&quot; only eight weeks who remain yet , until the first group of doctors will fall under the new treaty , progress must be made and the time runs out . &quot;
efforts on the part of BM@@ A to resolve the disputes by conversations had to take part in the government and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening of silence .
&quot; this was that of a promise , the Jerem@@ y H@@ unt had made the last month about it last month . &quot;
&quot; Jerem@@ y H@@ unt needs to act now , raise the heat @-@ up and address the concerns of assist@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; should he do not do this , the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are ready to perform further workers . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a kick of almost 13@@ ,000 route operations and 100.000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were included in order to allow doctors on the strike post@@ p@@ ette coverage . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes made by an adoption of the re@@ formed agreement with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
BM@@ A wants a better wave rate for the 5@@ 4.000 Assist@@ ants who will be subject to the contract .
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS staff , demanded the assist@@ ants to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; working measures achieve nothing of the only little , but already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nur@@ ses and their families only worry , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we talked to the combination of assist@@ ants and responded positively to the Ministry of Health and other min@@ istri@@ es in regard to concerns about tut@@ el@@ age and whist@@ le@@ aks . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training courses and the gender pay gap in medicine - a sign of how serious it was the employer , the Health Education England and the Health Ministry regarding compliance with the agreements with BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
the Â£ 2 @-@ per day drug that can reduce heart attack by heart attack
thousands of heart inf@@ ancy patients will benefit from a Â£ 2 per day medicine after the authorities recommended to adopt these more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ic drug Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeti@@ tive heart attacks for people with a heart disease .
&quot; the medication is admin@@ istered for 12 months after a heart attack , thus reducing the risk of a stroke rate or another heart attack . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ ICE regulatory authorities N@@ ICE have recommended a four years of in@@ gestion to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular issues . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ ICE regulatory authorities N@@ ICE have recommended a four years of in@@ gestion to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular issues . &quot;
&quot; around 14@@ 0.000 people suffer a heart attack every year , and a quarter of it suffer a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
cardiac abnormalities and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulate fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls .
&quot; if the floor@@ covering breaks down , it can cause a blood stream that causes the flow of blood to the heart and thus caused a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood@@ stream trig@@ gers , it can flow through the blood stream and flow the flow of blood to the brain that causes a stroke . &quot;
individuals who had already had a heart attack on a higher risk subject to further .
Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or which is manufactured by the British company A@@ stra@@ zen@@ eca and is distributed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood flow . &quot;
&quot; installing N@@ ICE , which today has been published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Center said : &quot; &quot; despite the availability of secondary education , a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack , a further heart attack or a stroke - often with the disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
&quot; by a preliminary recommendation of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand the treatment options to thousands of people that can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the effectiveness and safety of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the blood risk - is limited to a period of up to three years . the counter @-@ design recommends no treatment that goes beyond this period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness makes election @-@ bloo@@ ded in Muslim areas
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ for Rah@@ man was transferred last year to arrest a government report because of corruption from the office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to unknow@@ ingly ignored in Muslim communities such as a non @-@ governmental government report today .
&quot; the former cab@@ al member of Sir Eric Pic@@ kles , verb@@ ally acc@@ esses the police , constitu@@ tion@@ ers and Rath@@ le@@ ver@@ ns to be ignored from electoral abuse due to &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ no and Religion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former Minister of Integration and Commun@@ al Government , who now is an Ant@@ ony @-@ corruption , said that the intimid@@ ation of elec@@ tors from religious motives were so bad that it should be permitted to help the police to protect se@@ b@@ ons outside of voting in order to protect se@@ ated voters . &quot;
&quot; he recommends that voters should take a credit card , in order to prove their identity . &quot;
currently a vot@@ er must name merely its name and name .
&quot; the report proposes to dis@@ close the finger of a person if they vote their votes , in order to prevent someone twice cho@@ oses . &quot;
whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection from Sir Eric .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions made by non @-@ official Com@@ peti@@ tions or working groups . &quot;
&quot; this not only serves against election , but it is also supposed to protect the municipal government in front of the wider corruption and financial culture , which is associated with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets constitu@@ ents than in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special dish , that the official Mayor of Lut@@ for Rah@@ man should be revealed after a l@@ itan@@ ism on corrupt , and illegal practices of his Am@@ tes . &quot;
the court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he had put his critics with racism and Islam@@ ophobia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man should have led &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the relative duty of Muslim to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the consequence of im@@ itation , when someone cho@@ oses a person as someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud across the country .
he was particularly worrying about frau@@ dul@@ ent letters - in the older members of the Muslim community pressure on people had made a candidate of their choice .
&quot; Sir Eric , depicted , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including filling out to prove the identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report it is said : &quot; &quot; as evidence was appropriate that pressure on the needy members of some ethnic minorities was exercised , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elder , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ tic or ban@@ dits . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions have experienced such behaviour due to &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ no and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists deal with indi@@ ces to re@@ ap &quot; electoral re@@ ap . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , requires also tough@@ er registr@@ ations to prevent the electoral directory on immigrants and social exclusion . &quot;
consider options are to ask in front of your choice after identification .
&quot; do not remove remote inks on the finger of a person as soon as she has given her voice , to prevent someone twice cho@@ oses . &quot;
systematic audi@@ ts on the nationality of a person to perform that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation on request for an automatic selection of letters .
ban that political activists deal with complete correspondence and re@@ fraction of letters sel@@ ections .
the police give the authority to set up ab@@ lock@@ ings for electoral stations .
&quot; a legislative change , which facilit@@ ates an indictment due to intimid@@ ation according to the representation of the People Act 1983 ( Economics Act 1983 ) . &quot;
photography offered in Elec@@ tions .
requirement that only English can be used in the election stations ( except Wales ) .
&quot; intensi@@ fication of the training , to make sure that the staff tend to en@@ force that voters go alone into the election . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it amazing , &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets Fall was not a penalty . &quot;
&quot; the electoral course has Lut@@ for Rah@@ man and his deputy for due to a l@@ itan@@ ism on corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
it was sufficiently well known because of a number of reasons for the high demands of criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ised the effective &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ controlled &quot; of the Elec@@ tions of the Town H@@ alls .
&quot; Sir Eric said , &quot; The J@@ uris@@ diction in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal . &quot;
&quot; our country bears as the mother of parliam@@ ents a proud heritage , but the worrying and covered spread of electoral campaigns and denial of some authorities threatened this good reputation . &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ detached and other famous Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger of Olympi@@ as in Rio
fans of the Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio are this week beyond the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ vo@@ t out of edge and tape that has proven to be an impressive dou@@ b@@ ant of the Du@@ og@@ in of Cambridge .
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year Olympi@@ ac@@ kin is by far not the only one to give gold fighters , who has its own famous double @-@ go@@ ers - at least not , if one should give faith to social media . &quot;
&quot; to honor the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces leading to our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of Olympi@@ ad that have more than just a certain similarity with Hol@@ ly@@ au@@ ities . &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood . &quot;
&quot; other than K@@ ates doubles on the radar track , a lot of people on the internet focused on how a certain ar@@ cher could be the Gem@@ ini of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o . &quot;
the team member of the US team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has a ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter after pictures on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ secre@@ tly .
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher was thought of ins@@ anity in the social media and gave them that he already gets to hear from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I see no major similarity with the exception of the facial hair , shared Bra@@ dy of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I look at it as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be at the centre of attention : the open similarity between the British stre@@ et@@ inger Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
&quot; the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya must@@ af@@ ina with its big , expressive eyes should be able to go through as a dou@@ b@@ ant for the Cuban American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
and in the swimming pool the South African Schwi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
one course higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor .
&quot; another appealing comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similarly serious ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver med@@ all@@ ists Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova features more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne McC@@ ord , while the American Nathan was att@@ elled by fans , an &apos; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
&quot; strong women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ penter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter @-@ User was very happy that others have also noticed the similarities
theory put into the space : according to this user there is a reason for the similarity of the couple perhaps a reason
&quot; her satisfaction stated that &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ penter are almost identical . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the US @-@ football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ penter have an incredibly similar facial form and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical with the actress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal in Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , which has its own beautiful , wide smile that resembles that of Bring It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;

&quot; the comment@@ ator Byron Mac@@ Don@@ alds thought that his microphone was switched off , when he ends his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m to Fre@@ estyle skiing . &quot;
&quot; Mac@@ don@@ ald who had been fet@@ ched on board at the C@@ BS , in order to give more &apos; color &apos; , you could hear : &quot; this small 14 year old Chinese has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , he went like mad , died like a pig . &quot;
thanks for this .
&quot; the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming staff@@ el 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1,@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , allowing the Canadian to close the gap to China . &quot;
audience in all Canada responded quickly online after they were shocked by the sound and language
&quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Do@@ es of the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer has died from China &quot; like a pig &quot; ? ? ? ? ? &quot;
the idi@@ ot has not been cap@@ ed that they were still on show .
&quot; Ai Yan@@ han of China was described with the fin@@ alen 4 x 200m to Fre@@ estyle mos@@ sy for women as follows : &quot; &quot; this small 14 @-@ year Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; the criticism against Byron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , with whom he asked him a lot . &quot;
&quot; Twitter users did not return , when they heard , how uns@@ ur@@ bel Byron Mac@@ don@@ ald was &quot;
&quot; another Twitter User@@ in Sarah &apos;s wrote : &quot; &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you first introduce the C@@ BC and Canada and let us look like rac@@ ists . # ange@@ ec@@ elt .
&quot; short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel used to show the C@@ BC programme , live for the comment of Mac@@ don@@ ald and said : &quot; &quot; we are sorry that the comment has been broadcast over a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; it was an unhappy chosen description , we are sorry that it is happening . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ ze at the end of over 90 times in the people who responded to the effort via Twitter
the commentary box Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ don@@ ald .
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology with more than 90 other Twitter users who had compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network used too quickly and gave up a message .
we sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was possible that it has been broadcast .
we quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed yesterday evening with our viewers and our followers in the social media .
&quot; to clarify , By@@ rons comments related to the performance of the Schwi@@ mmer and not to them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were inadequate and an unhappy chosen formulation . Byron does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ don@@ ald did ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the show , tried to justify its remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed to be a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment of time to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I had taken after the women &apos;s s@@ wimm@@ ers in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ ics , he said . &quot;
&quot; I did not refer to the performance of the swi@@ mmer , not to them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended , and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark emp@@ ged on women who miss the middle in business sham@@ eless underwear
&quot; the buyers did not know where to see , when a woman moved their clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mark to try shelter . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , insp@@ ected them as they looked at it , drew them out and put them back into the shelf . &quot;
she moved on and rehear@@ sed four couple of under@@ pants in a shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping center in Folk@@ estone .
&quot; the Pri@@ mark business in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping center in Folk@@ estone , where the woman rehear@@ sed the under@@ pants before they put them back into the shelf &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ dson who felt at the same time in the store , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear she went back and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; standing in the middle of the out@@ lets , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the floor , drew her own ti@@ ghts and pants , and rehear@@ sed them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when they moved the under@@ pants that you obviously did not like , because they put them into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; he repeated the same with three further under@@ pants before they finally decided that you liked nothing , again and went out . &quot;
&quot; it didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b it to be someone ob@@ serving , or thinking about the person who would not buy the under@@ pants that they tried . &quot;
&quot; MS Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; how reluct@@ ant to think that someone had tried to take home with another person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; MS Davi@@ dson added : &quot; as I got involved , the employees tries to draw the garments from the sale after she went - what is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants to go home and find out that another woman she had and returned and she was not washed .
&quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident which occurred on Tuesday , 9 August at our branches in Folk@@ stone event@@ ful . &quot;
all products coming into question have been drawn from the sale .
how to protect themselves with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before c@@ eas@@ ants
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make him a little more secure . &quot;
&quot; we talked to Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Con@@ federation in New York to find out how to move from armed predat@@ ors to close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are approaching the front or from the back , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ e@@ wer for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; when one turns out to you from behind , you should consider yourself a surrender so that you can see your att@@ acker and go out of the cord , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
grab the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before going to face it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; then hit him with the knee in the bar and tw@@ isting , while the att@@ acker is squee@@ zed before pains , the weapon out of his hands . hit him with the course and move back@@ wards while taking the weapon on it . &quot;
&quot; in att@@ ackers to approach the technique , the technique is similar - move your body out of the orbit , grab the weapon and rot@@ ate it , so that the att@@ acker can not shoot . &quot;
&quot; while at the same time shift the weight to the gun and beat the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip , before moving back@@ wards and direct the weapon to it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
take a look at the video to see exactly how it seems to Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
&quot; but remember that there is a rob@@ bery at the safest , your money is too rich - unless you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master . &quot;
guide Ian Wright re@@ jects his tongue for a guide to the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe
a British travel@@ er under@@ went his immune system and WÃ¼r@@ ger@@ efle@@ x a serious test - by changing some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and livel@@ i@@ est places in Europe .
&quot; the present@@ er and Travel@@ er , Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sli@@ pped his course on a Euro @-@ cord , a ban@@ ker in the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a pur@@ se of a tractor fan , as well as a public telephone in Russia in order to prove the resistance of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before the death of every object , he used a det@@ on@@ ometer to show up and to show us what it will be introduced . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to day@@ light . &quot;
&quot; the thought , the pur@@ bone of a tractor fan , has been used already by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact they are more bad bacteria . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright spoke with physicians and medical professionals on the promotion of bo@@ wel bacteria , as well as his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately nothing left , what he de@@ ceased , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Wright has been known to test the resistance of his intestine , by travelling through the world and ate unique as well as wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public funds to train stations to pur@@ ge stations from toilets , the task set his immune system definitely under a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he told : &quot; already as a child , I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
in the film he was able to do justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its pro@@ strate showed a L@@ umin@@ ometer @-@ speed of over 4000 units .
in comparison to this amounts the L@@ umin@@ ometer @-@ speeds are less than 60 .
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to so@@ ak after their L@@ umin@@ dom@@ eter speed over 4000 units was , while fresh @-@ washed hands have a lot less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products vali@@ o produced the travel program &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number in different places like the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; This is coming to the worst which I have in a toilet , near . &quot;
there is nothing more than that !
&quot; I will do nothing here , because it is ec@@ static . &quot;
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o .
&quot; the company hosted Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which includes both Lac@@ tobac@@ ill@@ i and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system . &quot;
&quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look and at the same time explained the advantages of pro@@ biotics .
&quot; we led crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings by making sure that we said &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of only talking about products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the meaning of the intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
&quot; I also think , that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour ! &quot;
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film directed by the film , added : &quot; let me have lost it so - I had lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I have given to him , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that will be shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things in which it was easier to put Ian , to watch them and others where this was quite difficult . &quot;
I am glad we recorded some of these dirty treats available on film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents in the survey conducted in particular with the wellness of stomach and intestine and 58 percent said that they may at least occasionally use products that included lac@@ tobac@@ illus . &quot;

&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ ov@@ oy , who works for the administration of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she is afraid that the apartment is no longer repair . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was an absolute nightmare for people here and I believe that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
&quot; there are many things to consider , since this property is probably considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall . &quot;
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is likewise .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in time in the apartment and the police said that the terror that the family had inf@@ lic@@ ted , stre@@ amer with bas@@ eball bat , intimid@@ ation of residents , abuse , abuse and excessive cry , fight and res@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;

&quot; Del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication were rejo@@ iced by a lighten@@ ed neighbors , who said that their lives was made to hell . &quot;
&quot; one said : &quot; they turned around anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years along with them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today , tomorrow we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet - we are not used !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood Enfor@@ cement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said it was the family who had admin@@ istered to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , where the police was called at regular intervals , 20 years &quot;
on the over@@ pow@@ dered side of the joint was rub@@ b@@ ish junk and old toys .
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a dis@@ grace that there is the les@@ see , all responsibility for their behavior and that of their family since a del@@ usion is always the last step to take into account Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot;
&quot; it was a very difficult case , because the behavior was extremely difficult and their deeds to look for their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community that have gone brave on us and have made us the information provided . &quot;
I hope that this development will don@@ ate some neighbors and the message conve@@ ys that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .

&quot; after they were without shelter , the T@@ anya and your partner is now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many of the house walls of the house were filled with gra@@ ffiti .

bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mi@@ zut@@ ani .
the two Chinese saw it as expected in the end@@ game and made themselves the title among each other .
&quot; with it , it was clear that for the third time a Chinese would pick up a single Chinese title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings . &quot;
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympia area was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ã @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record alone , between the movements and at the time @-@ outs , they had no coaches . &quot;
&quot; they had withdrawn on the trib@@ une , and they left their gra@@ d@@ ders at a fair competition alone . &quot;

Donald Tru@@ mp spatial problems â³ in the election campaign
the leadership of the US @-@ Re@@ public@@ ans is afflic@@ ted by massive worries , also in the traditionally conservative states to serve their majority . &quot;
&quot; now , President Donald Tru@@ mp gave now weaknesses of his election campaign in the former republi@@ can strongh@@ old Utah . &quot;
&quot; a rare moment , in which usually large @-@ gau@@ ge and self @-@ confident Mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire has expressed something like concerns , such as correspon@@ dents . &quot;
&quot; after he has thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the own republi@@ can camp out of the race , now let &apos;s doubt his success in the fight for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; Tru@@ mp said before evangel@@ ical Christians that he asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; guilt should be false reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he took his well known media leaders again . &quot;
republi@@ can Hoch@@ bur@@ gen w@@ ack@@ able
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Re@@ public@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey by Sur@@ ve@@ y@@ USA , according to June Tru@@ mp and his bank@@ rup@@ tions from the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , alike . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tru@@ mp in front , but not by the distance that is common to Republican candidates in the federal state . &quot;
they are also regarded as endangered in Arizona and Georgia .
&quot; in an interview with the CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp responded to the question as he wants to stop the march of Cl@@ int@@ ons : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; and if left behind , I will be &quot; either successful , &quot; or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
&quot; he is doing nothing other than &quot; &quot; the truth to tell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is not rich for him at the end of reasons for political correctness , be it in order , said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press report , the party of Tru@@ mp about to report funds to support his election struggle , he should present no better survey values . &quot;
instead of what he wants to reach the candidates of the Re@@ public@@ ans for Congress stronger among the arms .
Olympia : dre@@ ary sc@@ am fraud on dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ commission for the event .
Ken@@ ias Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ es threatened with the second dop@@ ing affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
after a consultant attempt by a Dop@@ ing Control in the Olympic Village has sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee shared with the immediate establishment of an discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ Commission in order to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan functionality had announced that the former Spr@@ inter and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village has given a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this was reported to the team @-@ guide of Kenya about the dop@@ ing controversy .
&quot; the World association IA@@ AF has asked the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to make their own investigations , a IA@@ AF spokes@@ man shared with . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of IO@@ C , IA@@ AF will be able to make a review , &quot; the name was named in a IA@@ AF Declaration . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the Dop@@ ing Control station and signed as a F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the sample gave and signed , &quot; &quot; explained Ken@@ nel Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p SO@@ I . &quot;
&quot; he was in possession of the ac@@ credi@@ tation of athletes , who stood on the list for training control in the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency . &quot;
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was in Beijing World Cup four over 800 meters .
four days before was the Ken@@ yan Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tik leader Michael Rot@@ ich off the Rio Games .
he is to be informed about cash payments of his country via rising dop@@ ing tests .
&quot; according to a media report , he is said to have been arrested in Nairobi at his return at the airport . &quot;
&quot; Kenya is at the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing associations , already for prolonged time under special observation . &quot;
&quot; in the announcement of the IO@@ C issued by the IO@@ C , more than 2000 dop@@ ing targets in front of the Rio games became unusual , previously pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia will be taken into vis@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the world @-@ anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency had exercised much pressure on the African country in Brazil , to create an anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Law and a functioning control system . &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before Olympia start .
&quot; in the episode , the W@@ ada Kenya took Kenya from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing fight con@@ form with the rules of the W@@ ada . &quot;

Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cecilia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ year the Salzburg Festival will present the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Mary as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with a surprising Cecilia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ one masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classics and filled with the role of Mary a teen@@ ager .
&quot; the Sim@@ Ã³n Bol@@ Ã­@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuel@@ an conductor Gust@@ avo Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ med . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we have Bernstein &apos;s music really in our blood !
&quot; in this production , Bart@@ oli is playing a older one . &quot;
she is reminded of melanchol@@ y of her lovers with Tony , while her younger Mary plays and dance . &quot;
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because it is musically exceptional ! &quot;
and then it would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel like Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I feel like Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
&quot; so it is wise , of course also naive , and very passion@@ ately . &quot;
&quot; she resembles me very , my Italian character , which I have as a Roman , lau@@ ghing Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is so an honour for us to work with her .
it is an enormous generous person .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment back : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; you can see it in every one of his movements , in his views , it is his life ! &quot;
it &apos;s such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley , the &quot; West Side Story &quot; is up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; in this piece it goes to prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans have gone to New York , and they did not want New Yor@@ kers . &quot;
&quot; they are the same topics , and they are as expressive as then . &quot;
59 years later the piece is still relevant .

&quot; sult@@ ana was 17 years old , and died according to the details of her family shortly after she predicted to leave the war captured country and return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is lying in it - as a reminder and warning to others , that these are the risks associated with it in a war region - people assume that they ever make this decision , &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , sult@@ ana and two other school cities went from eastern London in a plane in direction to Turkey and then to a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ tan@@ as family has been told that she has married a ISIS fighter in Syria , and became a widow within a few months . &quot;

Turkey : Kurdish community expects mass evasion
&quot; whoever does not fit and Erdo@@ gan pra@@ ises are sitting on a pack@@ aged caffeine , &quot; says the br@@ ist@@ end of the GÃ¼@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; the Kurdish community of Germany is counting on short notice , with ten thousand @-@ seekers wishing to flee from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium @-@ term , it could even be &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; , &quot; the president of the Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; because of the harsh incident of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , after the coup attempt , the Kurdish commune is expected to be a mass cur@@ sed to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , medium @-@ term , with several hundred thousand protective seekers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime com@@ b@@ ate the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government passed over six months ago Kurdish bur@@ gers with criminal actions , be 500@@ .000 Kurds within Turkey on the run . &quot;
after the failed put@@ sch collap@@ sing and op@@ position@@ ists ethnic Turks .
many will be re@@ port@@ edly going to do in Europe if they continue to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that itself takes refugees in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; group leader lam@@ ented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in Algeri@@ an towns . &quot;
thus Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the off @-@ travel pressure on the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradi@@ cated or exp@@ elled in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U @-@ member . &quot;
&quot; government leader demanded that the federal government is positioned &quot; as sharp , as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its followers . &quot;
also in Germany there is a &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics .
for the first time I no longer feel safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of GÃ¼@@ len is also feared the flight of many Turks to foreign countries .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the Brand@@ brand@@ name as man@@ ag@@ les @-@ followers destroyed teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; he who does not fit and Erdo@@ gan now sits on a packed caffeine , by the way the Kem@@ alists and se@@ cul@@ ar@@ ists , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the GÃ¼@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the paper reported on calling on figures of the Federal Ministry of Defence , the Turks already presented the largest group due to political persecution in Germany already before the coup . &quot;
&quot; on 30 June , this 11.@@ 386 people have been justified by almost 29 per cent of all than asylum seekers ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , you will not find themselves before war , poverty or fu@@ tility . &quot;

&quot; for just as so far , it is not : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ day struggle - that bites . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the constitu@@ encies , are on vacation . &quot;
&quot; most of the tourists who are in the country are on the way to U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ Ã¼gen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so they are not allowed to choose the country &apos;s day . &quot;
&quot; there are practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , disper@@ se posters , ballo@@ ons , fl@@ yers , fl@@ yers and at the end of the vote are only tired . &quot;
&quot; until 4 September 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern needs to go over again by the people from Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his position . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , since 1998 strongest party , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys . &quot;
&quot; it will be exciting , how strong newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts , and what remains at the end of the coalition . &quot;
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 governing board , makes an almost in@@ conspic@@ uous electoral campaign , one sees from his major posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the land , spread roses and ch@@ atting a little with the people , as it already has his legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering cold feet have given and chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel the blame for the flour@@ ishing of Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; their refugee policy , you &quot; We create &quot; &quot; did the rise of right @-@ wing popul@@ ists , which will probably cost him the beautiful position now . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its leading can@@ did@@ acy , the Minister of Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced the way it is when you make the wrong time at the right place for the time . &quot;
she has invited twice the chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel : Merkel Bund@@ est@@ ag@@ sw@@ ahl@@ District is located in the north @-@ east .
&quot; the target group did not vote , there were more North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia , Berliner and Saxony as Star@@ en@@ burger and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; it was probably the majority of other federal states , said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot;
but it is also a pity to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
otherwise the Nor@@ theast @-@ CD@@ U is largely reli@@ eved of the usual choices on market areas and above shopping m@@ alls with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; so , Kok@@ ert , I just play a &quot; &quot; minor role &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union also noted that in the country you have the base , that it needs to be very strict , to find a drain to the people again . &quot;
&quot; as far as the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the land of the country hardly exists . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U campaign of Kok@@ ert on his comrades is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; &quot; they must go there where it hur@@ ts , namely where men are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Gol@@ dene weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much is standing on the game , Sell@@ ering his SPD has now called for a particularly committed campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind the CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just below the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the election of 2011 , the SPD had already made clear with 3@@ 5.@@ 6 per cent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the pol@@ ls , should also create the leap into the country &apos;s day . &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday need a modern virtue and put their constitu@@ tive campaigns in the internet .
&quot; online campaigns , &quot; says the Gover@@ ning Claudia MÃ¼ller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , a green election campaign on track search for native ab@@ stain@@ ers among the tourists . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the leading can@@ did@@ atin , cur@@ v@@ t just with a house@@ boat through the Mecklenburg Lake District and finds it even beautiful . &quot;
your impression : &quot; election in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ rehabilitation : restaurants suffer from blocking
&quot; at the speed , with which the B is refurbished 27 , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end up at 8 p.m. , there is all@@ u@@ bi@@ ous praise . &quot;
&quot; they did everything quite z@@ ack@@ ly , &quot; &quot; El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet station gas station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no de@@ duction .
&quot; the job@@ site was scheduled to be moved to the south on weekends , until the end of October everything will be ready . &quot;
&quot; the duck will also be responsible for the construction working persons , for example when it comes to the establishment of homes . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site on Monday to South Korea , the blocking of Asp@@ erg@@ straÃe in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dy@@ nia has been lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ tenburg has been restored , the traffic situation within the resort has relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now run from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen to the B 27 again .
the so@@ fter by the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were partly significant complaints , &quot; the leader of the commercial management of the refurb@@ ishment manager Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bach@@ e@@ straÃe , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straÃe , A@@ nerst@@ raÃe and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many abra@@ sives were looking for and more familiar to their Nav@@ i . &quot;
what led to some trucks in residential areas .
&quot; as well , the speed limits are not observed , the church also increased the measuring vehicle from M@@ Ã¶s@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable exceed@@ ence , &quot; &quot; says King who made himself the situation on site . &quot;
there are already two to three per minute fro@@ g .
the fastest was on the road with 77 km / h .
&quot; since the construction site has been moved , but it became more quiet . &quot;
&quot; for the business@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a small consol@@ ation that is now open to customers from Rot@@ tenburg . &quot;
&quot; in the cards , business@@ men don &apos;t want to be happy . &quot;
&quot; however , that the B 27 renov@@ ations has led to revenue growth , anyone who asks you to look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some are more affected . &quot;
&quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; End@@ customer &quot; , &quot; so for other companies , the rehabilitation hardly has consequences . &quot;
&quot; even at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Ma@@ ier Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; most light drop &quot; , &quot; but also means that of course , the run is missing . &quot;
&quot; the most strongly exploited are the local , along the road . &quot;
&quot; then J. Albert G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential threatening .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have it hard hit . &quot;
&quot; there were missing customers from He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ because . &quot;
we have to be glad about every euro turnover .
&quot; the revenues could be applied to &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road @-@ ens@@ ation have thrown its operation &quot; by two years . &quot;
half of his employees have to be released .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been dism@@ is@@ sed , the politics would have re@@ acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , the President JÃ¶rg Schmidt on a request from G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner , whether it could give a financial balance to the guest of the inn , otherwise from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 Now it must also bear the dis@@ advantages that result by the rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner knows of other country circles , where there was something generous . &quot;
&quot; in all cases , G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family run has been based since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history of history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars can now be subject to less frequently due to the complicated road of transportation , it can be understood . &quot;
&quot; if you can not drive down , it is also very different . &quot;
&quot; returning again , G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner has no doubt . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BS@@ E and bird flu , G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner keeps the effects of B 27 building work on his cli@@ ent@@ ele for the greatest crisis that has experienced its host in many years of history . &quot;
six months of construction work which is already brutal .
&quot; constantly , in the name of counter @-@ terrorism regulation the law is being scre@@ wed . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks , Interior Design de Ma@@ izi@@ Ã¨re is now a thicker security package . &quot;
but what has a D@@ ul@@ cer status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partners say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ Ã¨re gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; all of its proposals were politically vulnerable to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of Ministers on the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
you do not request anyone .
others . further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
&quot; even in this , I &apos;m praying . &quot;
&quot; however , as the Minister of Interior , he was situated on the results and of a &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in WÃ¼rzburg and Ans@@ bach , there has been a little time after the recent attacks in WÃ¼rzburg and Ans@@ bach before it presents its conclusions for the safety of the Republic . &quot;
but this is the more extensive .
&quot; some things are already known , announced , announced that there is a new security authority to deal with turn@@ key communication is not new . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , not the fact that Germany must implement several EU guidelines for flight data and weapons . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ Ã¨re a second startup for proposals that were not to be done with the SPD : he wants to put sympath@@ ies for terrorist groups , and jihadists with dou@@ bling citizenship by the German passport . &quot;
&quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; the CD@@ U @-@ man gives . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he does not consider this to be reasonable , and I don &apos;t ask anything that has no chance with the co@@ ali@@ tions . &quot;
a few new ideas are presented de Ma@@ izi@@ Ã¨re as well .
they are partly in themselves : he plans fast proceedings for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for the imprisonment of people before deportation .
&quot; refugees , which are targeted specifically to the country , should check their smart phones and open social media accounts for a security check . &quot;
D@@ ul@@ ture for ex@@ pi@@ ous asylum seekers wants to make some worse still worse than so far - such that crimes commit themselves or their pap@@ er@@ ers deliberately throw away their identity .
some of this is politically and legally married .
some also acts un@@ balanced and leaves questions openly .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of thought - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with certainty and terror ?
&quot; yes , de Ma@@ izi@@ Ã¨re , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the issues of refugees and terror . &quot;
&quot; but it cannot be ques@@ tioned , that the assass@@ ination of Ans@@ bach and WÃ¼rzburg were refugees . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , many people were worried about the high level of refugees concerned about security . &quot;
&quot; and things that the people are deeply busy , did not let themselves cl@@ ing in election times . &quot;
the internal security is enormous into the focus .
&quot; arrival in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in WÃ¼rzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are electoral campaigns . &quot;
Union and SPD must therefore become increasingly standing in position on the subject of internal security .
in the last days we went up between the two parties .
&quot; only a gar@@ th@@ piece dispute over the equipment of the federal police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior , in which the res@@ ists also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from the double citizenship . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ Ã¨re m@@ ishes itself here for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
&quot; from a return of double @-@ pass , he maintains nothing . &quot;
we had the discussion in Germany satisfied .
&quot; to do new , be not useful . &quot;
and at a Bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional concerns .
&quot; whether its own package is constitu@@ ed at all corners , and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ an partners , only has to show up . &quot;
there is a lot in things which could make a dispute .
&quot; however , the SPD is also trying to asser@@ t themselves on internal security . &quot;
&quot; leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel represent only careful conversation and said , &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to security . &quot;
still Volkswagen gli@@ der through .
&quot; despite diesel @-@ sc@@ and@@ als , the pay@@ ers pay off the world . &quot;
but not in all markets it is running round .
on the recall , there is a term for a term . &quot;
Volkswagen starts with the deliveries delivered to the second half @-@ year .
&quot; in the previous year , Europe &apos;s biggest free@@ auer can still show a plus in the previous year thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July , the core @-@ brand VW especially in Western Europe and charged with it again for the total sales , as that included in the D@@ ax . &quot;
the brand is sold in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year of the year .
&quot; sales alone in Western Europe , according to China the second most important market , were sales 14 percent below the previous year . &quot;
in the home market Germany s@@ laugh@@ ed the deliveries to almost a Sech@@ st@@ el .
marking JÃ¼rgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July especially to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; in addition , there have been a subsi@@ res@@ tra@@ int in some core markets &quot; altered economic framework &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup , Turkey has also stressed the British vote for the res@@ ign@@ ation from the EU , explained a spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhaust @-@ gas first ES@@ CA@@ LA@@ TED , is also further a minus to be@@ ech . &quot;
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; in total , the mainly affected family brand of the Lower Saxony falls more and more reliable by the diesel @-@ sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , there is only a delivery minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles to be@@ ech . &quot;
group leader Fred Kap@@ pler was able to move a sales journal from January to July .
&quot; 1.3 percent more vehicles supplied Volkswagen in this period , around 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software disp@@ ens@@ ed .
VW is calling up to 2.5 million cars in Germany alone in Germany .
in the course of re@@ armament reiter@@ ated VW that the reconstruction of the cars has no negative effects .
&quot; after re@@ armament of the vehicles there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; the bus service to the client after re@@ armament is a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; as mentioned on Friday in the company name . &quot;
reason are legal matters .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported , Volkswagen granted its German customers yet a guarantee for prot@@ rac@@ ted diesel models . &quot;
this was confirmed on the last Monday VW @-@ representative in the State Department .
the Ministry of Transport was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has to fulfil the supervis@@ ors of my investigation Commission and the KBA Executive Committee . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations of these are not accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has adopted the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power after re@@ armament do not take place deterior@@ ations and all type @-@ approved vehicle values remain unchanged . &quot;
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guar@@ ant@@ y &quot; but not how it was in business travel .
&quot; with the vast term &quot; &quot; guar@@ ant@@ y &quot; &quot; Volkswagen provides the opportunity to make customers an example a year after re@@ armament , approximately with a motor damage to a workshop - and this can lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; in the customer interest , it is important to avoid that there is no other damage to any other damage , which occurs at all with the se@@ g@@ ass@@ sc@@ andal , to an in@@ security regarding possible warranty conditions . &quot;
&quot; this is why I do not use the term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich austerity in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; boss Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who use 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily accounts . &quot;
&quot; the federal government of German banks speaks of an individual case , and does not see a signal : normal austerity must not be feared to pay for their austerity pen@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; stores banks money by night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.@@ 4 percent pen@@ alties . &quot;
this charge will demand the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund from September from private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or day @-@ day accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs 400 euros in the year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
it has been around 40 million Euros that could be up@@ lifted from one day to the other and which he could not use .
&quot; they are on the bank account with me and cause 0.@@ 4 percent cost , &quot; said the dealer . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot set up for each million 4000 Euros . &quot;
the cost is now available after the cur@@ sors of the principle .
&quot; let the cash just lie in the v@@ aults of the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank , would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t get the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the ban@@ quet . &quot;
most customers could have understanding and change to other assets .
only few mig@@ rates to other banks .
&quot; association of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes considerable costs at all banks . &quot;
&quot; to wear it alone , be &quot; operational lasting not possible . &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore increased their fees for con@@ sign@@ ment , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
&quot; with pen@@ cin@@ ations for deposits from three million euros , the Thur@@ in@@ gian Volks@@ - and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burger Land have made head@@ lines with their sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; he said Michael Kem@@ mer , Managing Director of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect individuals to pay long @-@ covering for deposits , in addition , the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks have much too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a chin @-@ up , which is equipped with a little lus@@ c of the property . &quot;
&quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , even if they are free of charge . &quot;
&quot; in 1911 , Gen@@ ossen@@ schaft bench G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gladly , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; the region live well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ oper@@ atives of Bavaria are currently under no further banks known to charge a compensation approach for deposits of private customers , &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the president of the Federal Association of German People and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ banks ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ Ã¶h@@ lich , had declared the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go to the neg@@ atives , is very , very high . &quot;
the competition is tough and it imp@@ ly the emig@@ ration of investors to competition .
the customers in Germany will not like to please the customers in the width .
destination : who is buying it ?
lonely men medium @-@ aged men love plates .
&quot; before you have to rush to the comment , to re@@ boot it under the pseu@@ donym non @-@ Alle@@ vi@@ als of the Middle Ages with r@@ ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the complex recovery of gram@@ ophone records do not want to welcome a boom in Mill@@ enni@@ als , who want to welcome the novel@@ ty of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia . &quot;
&quot; those who recently bought a record recently , are all forecast according to the age between 45 and 54 . &quot;
in fact the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyers .
it is also not a hor@@ des through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older Platt@@ ling buyers keep their feelings more likely to spend ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on television , I would follow the camera while in the midst of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a humble gray suit carry and wild st@@ ace@@ ful before I keep standing , my hands hold and something dominating the way : &quot; so , let us take a closer look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let us take a look at it . &quot;
&quot; although the heart of So@@ hos is slowly hung on his charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent vendors were located - there still is a handful of lu@@ dic@@ ant business transactions . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and minds through observation . &quot;
&quot; Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I from Sister Ray ( Daten@@ et &apos;s number : two young women , three men middle ages ) follow the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Daten@@ re@@ count ) : eight men middle ages , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and walks through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , question I ? &quot;
&quot; I guess already , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records . &quot;
&quot; this records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by email , I am not followed by him ) , dress the walls of his home . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles , the result of its available income : it is now able to buy panels which he could not afford to buy stuff when he sold young and ple@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70 &apos;s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things that I thought was probably a little too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agre@@ es that those who buy the plates , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend their own time , and adds : &quot; I non @-@ smoking , and I don &apos;t drink very much . &quot;
this is my push .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Sister Ray , also believe that many customers that he meets to meet the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about com@@ eback and causes it to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; for the conversations that I have led , people usually have been dra@@ ined from 1998 or 1999 of their collection . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , sell now their CDs to buy their panels , &quot; says he . &quot;
this would explain the boom of followers of a specific age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to recognize that records a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers took advantage of the contact@@ less payment system . &quot;
some Balaton @-@ fans will feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of familiar sound@@ pl@@ atten@@ tions of objects of objects that are happy ho@@ ots .
&quot; I think sometimes it may be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consol@@ ation , &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot;
it is with me as a collector and I think it is the case with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; we are like your social worker ! &quot; &quot; a staff of a board stack . &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by the IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of the people who bought a record last month , they have not yet heard . &quot;
&quot; the survey was also found that 41 % possess a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , do not have a record player . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned , while through a pile of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works with sounds of the Universe ( data acquisition : three men middle ages ) has noticed a &quot; &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; &quot; of Revi@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; someone came here only recently and said : &quot; I have not a record player , but I would like to buy a radio plate so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more produ@@ ci@@ ous , less musi@@ c@@ or . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I have no turn@@ tables . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older who come only slowly . &quot;
&quot; stop@@ over , which has devoted the sound @-@ disc almost a whole floor , has a colorful audience than I &apos;m going to go . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ ager and women aged . &quot;
&quot; even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above @-@ standing shops - Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s newest synthes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ c@@ pack@@ er pop instead of experimental jazz , it is good to see such diversity among customers . &quot;
&quot; none of them looks strange , but the psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to imagine if you are standing in addition to someone 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around in the store for a few minutes and looks at the var@@ ic@@ ity of the records . &quot;
it is more likely to have a man@@ nequ@@ in than a big one .
&quot; it does not deserve a lot , so the collection of boards is not a real option , &quot; she says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way but the beauty of records is ... it drives with a loved si@@ gh si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it really is unique .
my last stop is a business which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I make the appearance to mu@@ te the jeans Hot@@ pants , I observe a group of young teen@@ ager , who are group@@ ed for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras , before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a cros@@ ley turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of panels of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential panels for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody can see them - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some so far above it is impossible to put them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; disk art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that every attraction for these things could mean more money for the industry and to send some clients into the depths So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as records . &quot;
&quot; even if my research showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v will be right , let them at least exist in ground@@ water in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and squ@@ ad@@ versaries , to exist in the reality , record , and in online . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they will not spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with stro@@ lling through record transactions of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through panels , while putting the rigid view of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old moder@@ ator , that rises over the shoulders of no middle aged men . &quot;

French Court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; French court rejected a wide range of authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees are living . &quot;
&quot; in a court store this week ar@@ gues the authorities in Cal@@ ais , that the state should be wor@@ sen@@ ed to sell 72 Pro@@ visional stores where individuals within the camp of goods , from cigarettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , hair@@ dressing services offer or tea for 50 cents ( 40 pers ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places would be torn down , because they would be a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid , and which a fire@@ - and san@@ itation risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals are offered by the state supported union and other groups , not enough food for growing numbers in stock would offer . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they led out that the provisional stores and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need . &quot;
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there was no legal basis for the assignment of people who operate 72 Pro@@ visional businesses , but then stated that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais are absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ FranÃ§ois Mol@@ la said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just people who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas are quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by precip@@ itation was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos;s CafÃ© des camp , which is commonly practiced and 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as a consultation on asylum causes for the hundreds of needy people , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0@@ ,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos;s CafÃ© . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that the closure &quot; &quot; for these children of a disaster would be , of which the most recent eight years are old . &quot;
the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated to rise to more than 9.@@ 000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase of new com@@ ers in the course of the summer .
despite Olympia disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant

here comes the Enfor@@ cement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany Ras@@ er must adapt to the next generation of speed rail : in various federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , which should be particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic and Enfor@@ cement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for instance on accident , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction or to building bridges with temporary Tem@@ ples there are often no necessary infrastructure to provide there with a stationary ap@@ plet to ensure the speed limit . &quot;
a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or time @-@ consuming .
&quot; the Enfor@@ cement Tra@@ iler is auto @-@ sufficient : its battery keeps for un@@ interrupted measurement , five days , the case data are encrypted via a modem . &quot;
laser measurement technology can also be recorded all vehicles over several tracks at the same time .
&quot; variable velo@@ city limits as well as transit connections to time , lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the up@@ loaded state , one can move the supporters according to manufacturer with each car with tra@@ ilers . &quot;
&quot; as a result , it is not easy to use , it is lower@@ ed in the measurement operation , so that the wheels disappear in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way , also sh@@ atter@@ proof out@@ lets disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the bl@@ iss before v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer is tested by Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also bl@@ ends with the new technology : recently , France has subscri@@ bed 100 pieces after placing an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
&quot; Britain gets silver in the 7 @-@ er ru@@ g@@ by , after this master@@ class gold cat@@ ches gold &quot;
&quot; the impressive performance of Britain during 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by arrived in the final on Thursday evening to a corrupt stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were struck with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odoro stage in Rio . &quot;
&quot; Fiji on a masterpiece of handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , after@@ math , line run and ro@@ cking force to gain gold - their first Olymp@@ ics of all color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was sent by the non @-@ bad consol@@ ation prize of the Silver Medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they proposed New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the significant defeat of the bos@@ ses , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals on the same day could fall to them in the final . &quot;
&quot; however , regardless of this , Fiji in this form would have been a 15 @-@ man team in stock form . &quot;
it could be a consol@@ ation for GB - but it is likely not - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal at his neck : fi@@ j@@ is chief trainer Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wimbledon . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
they lost eight years ago by Ryan every game at the Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
here they only lost one .
&quot; this fla@@ p is going to do , but progress is ast@@ o@@ unding . &quot;
&quot; Fiji began wonderful , and caused the attacks of G@@ b &apos;s from fun . &quot;
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. , as if one would walk in passenger buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with another four minute game time , Jerry Tu@@ wai still added another attack from the right corner he turned . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely fet@@ ched the ball .
&quot; a he@@ p@@ tive appearance of Mitchell stopped the mountain from Man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it has not just stopped . &quot;
in the seventh minute le@@ te j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ release and there was still a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ umes by other weak tac@@ kling of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the pause .
&quot; it &apos;s like this , as if Fiji was born to play the 7 , while the GB still had to be learned . &quot;
so it is also .
&quot; GB led fundamental changes to half @-@ time through and closed the fi@@ ji@@ anic gap ... for all four minutes , leading to the conditions of the first half times , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through to a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game had been running for a long time in favor of the SÃ¼d@@ se@@ ein@@ sul@@ aner , whose fans pi@@ pers , b@@ anners and danced on the jer@@ king . &quot;
it was not hard to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame set the cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
the whist@@ le sounded that the Fi@@ j@@ is embr@@ aced and GB k@@ ick@@ ed cr@@ ashes in the lawn .
&quot; previously on the day , Fiji Japan had been defeated in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a scar@@ ce half @-@ Finn @-@ match from the race - Great Britain transformation of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the boats in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton crossed the line with an impressive foot work and achieved a gate under the post in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant delay of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ aside team , secured the win and thus the Silver Medal . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the coach of Train@@ ers for rowing victory
there will be no em@@ ot@@ inactive gold than with these games and that wants to be what is called .
&quot; from the first ru@@ th@@ ru@@ b to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve , which go into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if it was only the two who were sitting at the ru@@ d@@ der , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present as she used to the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in two without a control woman in a row , the first women in the history of British Sports , who put on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; your domin@@ ance was absolutely , at least their 3@@ 9.@@ 3 in@@ consistent use , which is also exempl@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athlete who are reflecting on the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ges , which is not the way of the triumph@@ al arch . &quot;
&quot; behind each gold in the ruin there is a bat@@ al@@ lion on wil@@ dered hel@@ pers , which make the difference and it was no more inf@@ ant than the coach , who would not survive if he was diagnosed this day when it was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
how he said he what risky .
&quot; I had the bladder cancer , which is able to operate and that they did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do that , he spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a rather obli@@ vious situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the Trio had luck that he was in the start of 2014 , out of season , could begin what the break kept to a minimum if that under such circumstances is the right term . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go back better soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 foot at a time when they said that some steps would be enough . &quot;
this is how it begins .
rowing is already a challenge but that makes it even greater .
&quot; in the in@@ medi@@ ability of the victory , their first thoughts on Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ ending morning to talk more than usual and tried to process its own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was as captain in the Royal Ar@@ ll@@ ery reg@@ iment in an operation in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . that &apos;s perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it is repeated only how much I mean , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked . &quot;
we were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be no one , hence a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world . &quot;
I could not have wished for a better person for wearing or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began opening up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were very imprisoned at the moment .
&quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; stay in process , stay in process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important to not let yourself tear .
&quot; we had a good start and at the same time , we were not sure to make something big . &quot;
&quot; we did not want fire@@ works , we just wanted to achieve a good result , going out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the pair will take a time for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding with their own with the TV @-@ adv@@ ent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that that was my last race .
this would have too much pressure .
&quot; in London it took about six months to understand that I am a Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; it feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
31 years have been exempl@@ ary for clarity
&quot; the executive director of the &quot; &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ group &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ Ã¶ller , goes retirement . &quot;
the association is regarded as &quot; bay@@ ern@@ al &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a small Frank@@ ish drinking water as a model for the large water producers .
&quot; thus , it was mentioned some time ago in the original state of the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk . &quot;
little later the water forum became the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken the Second World War .
&quot; the work of the group @-@ group &quot; &quot; Bav@@ arian &quot; &quot; was regarded as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ Ã¶ller , which was 31 years in the second @-@ association , 28 years as Managing Director . &quot;
&quot; now , at the age of 65 , he was passed in retirement age . &quot;
&quot; the pot@@ able water @-@ purpose association with its headquarters in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , has about 150@@ ,000 cu@@ bic meters of water and supplies 32 places and hamlet with about 5@@ 500 residents . &quot;
&quot; the municipalities are the churches of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach , and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ah . &quot;
for further towns and municipalities there are water supply agreements .
&quot; the current chairman , broad@@ band &apos;s mayor championship in Ger@@ tru@@ d BÃ¼h@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ Ã¶ller was set in 1985 as a Wasser@@ wart and has already been appointed Managing Director of the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; its tasks have been very diverse and they extend from the water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities , the household @-@ planning , calcul@@ ating fees and contributions to emergen@@ cies in weekends , &quot; said the leader . &quot;
&quot; outstanding events called it the commissioning and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , plot of land in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the re@@ plen@@ ishment of a central computer control ( 2004 ) , and the re@@ aring of water pipes . &quot;
there was no stand@@ still without a stand@@ still and I have always recorded innovations because water bri@@ des and drinking water the most important food .
&quot; in her lau@@ d@@ atio she praised GÃ¶@@ llers &apos;s faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
he was used with a lot of cardiac stimul@@ us for his water @-@ purpose and he has lived the water @-@ purpose association for the purpose of water than it would be its own company .
a few weeks ago he used as a real practition@@ er to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ group to nit@@ rate from the district of Unter@@ fran@@ ken .
he received a lot of recognition and praise for this .
Ru@@ pert G@@ Ã¶ller took part in the Fi@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons Greeks who worked with him 28 years .
he is the best water @-@ club and he was a loyal scar@@ ce .
together we were an unbeatable team .
as a highlights from his point of view he drew the well @-@ building and the re@@ struc@@ turing of the two @-@ structure association .
the biggest challenge and the tough@@ est use were the bur@@ gl@@ ary in the strongh@@ olds at Kirch@@ lou@@ der on 3 January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night through so that the villages could be supplied with water .
even the supply of Neu@@ brunn one can only maintain once more because they filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with h@@ oses .
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose Association was handed over to Daniel Sav@@ mer from Lau@@ ter to follow the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ Ã¶ller .

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man began on Friday at 10.@@ 45 in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) in his partner and wounded .
&quot; the man called himself with us and expressed his partner , &quot; &quot; said a poli@@ ze@@ al pre@@ cher@@ in . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator was on the flight to him will be publicly folded .
&quot; meanwhile , nation@@ wide , because Sven S. could be on the move by car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters large , muscular , brown , brown @-@ brown and has a bal@@ at@@ ze . &quot;
meanwhile the police have released a photo of him .
but it is a few years old .
meanwhile the man is wearing a gl@@ at@@ ze .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon in itself so the police .
who Sven S. sees is supposed to call the 110 .
the police speaks of an &quot; association . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator 1981 . &quot;
the competent police in LÃ¼@@ beck would initially have no information about the T@@ ather@@ gang or the relationship between perpetrators and victims ; but they confirmed that a man was killed .
&quot; it is a kill@@ ings , &quot;
&quot; we are not saying this currently , &quot; said a poli@@ ze@@ g in LÃ¼@@ beck . &quot;
according to the e@@ ye@@ witnesses it was a special command ( SE@@ K ) at the scene of the scene .
steel - lumin@@ osity for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ exploited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains of additional costs in meg@@ acities .
&quot; financial stress , which is threatened by the eco @-@ stream industry , are from the table . &quot;
&quot; it remains in the liberation of renewable energy production at the stock tra@@ ilers in the German steel industry , &quot; said Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West German General newspaper &quot; ( SPD ) . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m really glad , that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years . &quot;
&quot; the European Commission was initially planned to ask the steel manufacturer , the gases coming from the ho@@ fen to electricity generation for their own consumption , to check out the check@@ out . &quot;
&quot; the steel industry is threatened with additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year , according to the German industry industry . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , I now give a basic certificate with the EU Commission for talks with competitive Com@@ miss@@ arin Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , all an EEG exchange rate varies from 20 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , this will not be raised in the steel industry . &quot;
IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the European Commission for self @-@ feeding .
&quot; thus , the status quo of the previous regulation will largely be determined . &quot;
particular importance have the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel is future &apos; , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others need to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; also in the reform of the emission legal framework , climate and employment targets are considering &quot; &quot; IG Metall boss JÃ¶rg Hof@@ mann stated in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering since the financial crisis in 2008 under over@@ capacity and a considerable price .
last year the situation continued to ti@@ ghten up as the world &apos;s largest producer of China in the face of the weak@@ ening domestic demand for steel on the world market .
European manufacturers reject Chinese steel companies as well as dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring year the situation has a bit relaxed .
&quot; for one hand , the inc@@ ense inc@@ isions are on import steel effect , for the other the economic insight into China have asc@@ ended . &quot;
unclear is how sustainable the price @-@ up is .
the German branch @-@ pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rupp was careful on Thursday .
&quot; finally , the prices would have been rather stagn@@ ated . &quot;
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further costs .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rupp did not want to exclude at the end of the work of individual plants .
&quot; in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel manufacturer remain careful despite the increasing price and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced more than six percent less steel than in the previous year as the economic association steel closed on Friday . &quot;
after a brief increase in May the crowd went back to the second month .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production rose by two percent below the previous year . &quot;
the association is calculated in the coming months thanks to an improved order with a rising output .
&quot; community , spirit , health : sing , sen@@ iors &quot;
&quot; the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp for all her life : as a young girl she was in the school &apos;s choir , in the Mag@@ ister@@ ium study she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors . &quot;
&quot; singing me - emotional and physically , &quot; it describes . &quot;
&quot; after a sample it feels balanced , cheerful and a total of living , she says . &quot;
&quot; moreover , she is doing something good in the process of her health and spirit . &quot;
&quot; because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler of the German senior liga . &quot;
&quot; most sen@@ iors sing in chorus and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular assembly , sen@@ iors can establish social contacts and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; because they often solve social and familiar structures over the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in their choir : &quot; to speak and organize themselves to the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being .
&quot; singing can be exhausting in a positive way , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
because exercising sen@@ iors a deep and controlled breathing .
&quot; whoever calls his lungs regularly , he is not as fast in everyday life as soon as the pu@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; even though it is about obtaining the sound of the voice at age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Bundes@@ arbeits@@ gemeinschaft &quot;
&quot; in the older generations the joint singing had a much higher value , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure , it explains . &quot;
&quot; it is often observed that the singing or hearing of songs in older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; thanks to lyrics , and especially melodies arise , and even deny people lying down on the following occur@@ ren@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; while singing , the head is also required for a special achievement , &quot; explains L@@ enz . &quot;
focus on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge .
&quot; elderly people who live alone , practice not only on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem grows by singing in a choir .
&quot; to show itself : if I spend long for something , I will better and grow over me - this experience strength@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he means , little talent , betra@@ ying L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who he@@ ars when a tone next to it ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the appropriate offer , sen@@ iors have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; someone from the acquaint@@ ance sings in a senior ench@@ y@@ ma , one can simply connect . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views of the cho@@ irs around the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ astic choir can apply directly to the church or the church .
many sen@@ iors can also be found via the Internet .
&quot; anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbors to help with the inter@@ ne@@ tre@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; who lust has to sing , should necessarily connect to a choir called H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing is doing well and has something liber@@ ating - this is true of all ages .

female cats can recognize the excit@@ atory of Cat &apos;s babies on the ch@@ ew of the ch@@ icks .
&quot; they respond by ten percent faster to Lau@@ te of K@@ ittens , who have found themselves in great distress as scientists from the veterinary University of Hanover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
&quot; males also react to the herds of kittens , but always the same . &quot;
&quot; evi@@ dently , the acoustic differences between the bl@@ wing of less and strong bul@@ ls for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the Biolog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; it is first authorized by the study that was published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evolution@@ ary Biology . &quot; &quot;
in a previous investigation the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the cat @-@ scre@@ ams was different with the ur@@ gency of their help .
observed in a total of nine adult men and eight grandchildren from the animal management of the MH@@ H .
&quot; they were presented for a reput@@ ations of small ones , which were taken for three minutes from the throw @-@ box and separated from both mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ aming of stronger kittens , which were raised in addition . &quot;
the researchers keep their results despite the small sample for expressive .
&quot; all females , even those who had no own offspring , responded to the cry , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; it turned out to go faster to the loud@@ speaker , if this cri@@ b played the very early kit@@ ten . &quot;
this ability may be argu@@ ably or developing with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have responded at all , &quot; said the Biolog@@ ica . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already studied many times in men the reactions of women and men in baby noises . &quot;
&quot; some studies showed that women were sensitive on infants , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , the Biolog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski takes hold of &quot; gala &quot; to the Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an SÃ¼@@ kis@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey there has been a arrest warrant issued in Turkey against the former football star Hak@@ an SÃ¼@@ ver .
it is being thrown to be a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , Turkey will be taking place an important football game in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; before the Du@@ eling of the Arch@@ riv@@ als of Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup into Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is said . &quot;
&quot; already in the im@@ position of the exclusion in July , the government , the everyday life of norm@@ alities should not be affected . &quot;
&quot; but this does not apply to those who are suspected of charge the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah GÃ¼@@ len , who is responsible for the coup . &quot;
it is also not being done before football .
against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an SÃ¼@@ ch@@ r the Public Pro@@ secutor introduced a arrest warrant .
&quot; thus , it is now being thrown into the south of America living in America , become a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; SÃ¼@@ kis@@ r will be the supporters of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah GÃ¼@@ len , who is held responsible for the coup of President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
&quot; this applies first to 90 days , but in fact , this applies to the life of the most Turks to the life of most Turks , but as good as no effects . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the noc@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for an end . &quot;
the sport is - like all the land - split up in followers and opponent &apos;s Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club visits are traditionally not among the friends of the President .
&quot; but what the Gro@@ s of the Turks , but in view of dramatic experiences in history , the strict ref@@ usal of military put@@ ties . &quot;
even the fans themselves agree - no matter if their heart beat for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or sightseeing .
at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala &quot; it will be back especially again on Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski .
his sports value introduced the KÃ¶l@@ ner in the ex@@ pi@@ red season with proof : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first season as the Top@@ sc@@ orer of his organisation .
in the end game against Fen@@ er@@ bah@@ ce he achieved the 1 : 0 @-@ winner .
the paper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place .
he has completed the season in an excellent way and secured his team to the tro@@ phy .
&quot; thanks to Pol@@ di , this season was found a conci@@ li@@ atory season for the record champion . &quot;
&quot; after the pre @-@ round kno@@ ck@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also draws up in the Europe League early . &quot;
in the SÃ¼@@ per Li@@ g only reached rank sixth .
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; we managed and that is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
for Masters Pa@@ kt@@ as the game was better .
&quot; above all , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who used the first title with 26 of the season , was the basis for the 14th title . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans continue to return to the return of 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; at the beginning of the AC Florence among the Treaty of AC , Florence had announced only the put@@ sch@@ ene Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt to not return to the political situation in the country after his European holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must say it only , &quot; commented the magazine &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; chief of Fi@@ anc@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; in addition to this , the storms would have to abandon for around a third of its to 7.5 million euros estimated , it was clear : &quot; &quot; his salary in Florence can not pay . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have medals opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year Justin Gat@@ lin was closed twice due to dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova must not start in Rio .
others over@@ took athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh - they fight in Rio to medals .
the subject of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who signed up after a Dop@@ ing Sper@@ re before playing ( 100 meters chest ) mer@@ cil@@ ess and burned . &quot;
it offered a sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le scenery : with a set of sm@@ iles she was still in the hall and prov@@ okes her appearance with her appearance .
&quot; when it was established , they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a che@@ a storm . &quot;
&quot; but there are many more sports@@ men , who are going to start at the Olympic Games in Rio despite dop@@ ing past . &quot;
here an overview :
Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was locked for two times because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; since his spell the Olympi@@ ad from 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion is even faster than before , it is more than 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered to be the greatest ch@@ all@@ engers of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympi@@ ad and si@@ eben@@ fold World Championship had to sit on a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after taking the intake of pain through oxy@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after a surgery I had strong teeth , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended themselves . &quot;
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : 2011 became the Olympi@@ ad of 2012 / World Championship in 2013 and European champion from 2010 to 2016 positive to the banned const@@ ants in meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine .
Per@@ kovic captiv@@ ates the wi@@ el@@ ly intake and was locked six months .
the four th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great Gold@@ fav@@ ors .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ride ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the Beijing Olympi@@ ad and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was tested in 2010 positive and closed 21 months . &quot;
&quot; a remedy for penis enlargement was responsible , praying Mer@@ ride . &quot;
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the biggest fastest man in the world .
&quot; Ivan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ ing , Belarus ) : hardly any athletes have been detected so many medals . &quot;
&quot; thus , Ti@@ ch@@ on lost its World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after it has been fixed with him testosterone dop@@ ing . &quot;
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave Olympia @-@ silver 2004 for ster@@ oid accessories and the EM @-@ title in 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
the bronze medal of the Olympic Games in 2008 took back on account of a prototype of the International Sport Tribunal for the International Olympic Games in 2008 .
&quot; with 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m , it is ranked two of the world tran@@ sh@@ list . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the World Cup and Gold@@ fav@@ our@@ tin was first tested in May , but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; during the 29 years old world championship , references to the in@@ gestion of a closed dietary supplement was found , the blocking of the world @-@ anti @-@ Dop@@ ing @-@ Agentur W@@ ada fell mild and ran on 13 July starting . &quot;
bom@@ bing terrorism in Thailand - Ost@@ rei@@ cher@@ in viol@@ ated - Vari@@ ous T@@ ote
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ Ã¶@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; it has suffered inter@@ sec@@ ts and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left them again . &quot;
your home trip will be scheduled for early September .
&quot; whether from further explo@@ sions on holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket , as well as in the southern towns of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he , also Austrian citizens are still unclear . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stand in close contact with local authorities , so Schn@@ ul@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; at some 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok located Hua H@@ in , were first of two bombs on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; according to police , the police were killed and killed about 20 people , including the lady , three Germans , three Dutch and three Italians . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , two explo@@ sives came up , and another man was killed on the authorities . &quot;
also in the morning an bomb attack was reported in the morning .
at the Det@@ on@@ ation near the popular Bad@@ est@@ ran@@ ds Pat@@ ong was injured and viol@@ ated a taxi driver .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani in the south @-@ eastern coast of the country explo@@ ded a further bomb that killed a city council .
the explo@@ ding was according to the authorities in a flower be@@ et before the prec@@ inct of the coastal police .
&quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations made in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g at the south @-@ west coast , as well as in Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he , at the southeast coast has several injured . &quot;
&quot; one is from connection to the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , whose name meant . &quot;
&quot; the bomb attack bear the same manuscript , &quot; said Army Major Dan@@ ai Krit@@ av@@ ee Fri@@ day@@ early in front of journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
&quot; it was too early to express themselves for possible motives , but probably it is about the deeds of Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern in the attacks which is typical for the bom@@ bing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared the attacks in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement or international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
but one rather go out that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
&quot; over the past few days , the authorities would have received secrecy references to upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however they were not informed about the exact time and places . &quot;
still unclear what group behind the attacks .
&quot; the police pointed out their officers throughout the country that security around important government buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment area . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are always smaller bombs , but they usually do not address tourists . &quot;
in Hua H@@ in is a palace built over the years of Thailand &apos;s king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; after the turbulent bom@@ bers , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recommen@@ ding the Austrian Foreign Ministry on his homepage , the instructions of Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security threat ( security level 3 ) for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani , and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a , as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ k and its surroundings . &quot;
after confron@@ tations between security guards and Muslim populations will not be discour@@ aged in these provinces .
increased safety risk ( safety level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
the proposals on Thursday and Friday made a few days after a controversial referendum on a military jun@@ ta developed by military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military influence over the years to come .
&quot; Jun@@ ta chef and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to insti@@ gate chaos , while the country is moving towards stability , an improvement in economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , who took power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , keeping itself well @-@ good , the kingdom has led to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military did not succeed in getting the grip of the Muslim rebellion for years in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
&quot; just a year ago , almost one year ago , in Bangkok was killed during a attack on a popular Hindu de@@ mere 20 people - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloody attack of the recent history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is into the vis@@ or of the Federal Republic for constitutional protection .
&quot; according to several provincial divisions , the constitu@@ encies of the association have also made the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see in the &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty movement &quot; &quot; locking points for efforts against the freedom of democratic principles , &quot; said Constitu@@ tional chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot;
thus Zu@@ w@@ anders Islamic faith or from the Middle East will diff@@ use in more extreme way .
that &apos;s why we observe the movement as well .
&quot; identity movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and &quot; the &quot; loss of own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; constitu@@ encies in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ WÃ¼rttemberg , NR@@ W , Lower Saxony , Saxony and ThÃ¼r@@ ingen - watch the &quot; Identi@@ ty . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , his authority was closely coordinated with the provincial divisions . &quot;
&quot; groups like the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; try to pick up their target group wherever it stands , &quot; &quot; said the Constitu@@ tional chef . &quot;
&quot; in general , they try to speak with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
Islam@@ ists as well as right wing popul@@ ists .
this is not a tex@@ tual advertising for your own thing .
the propaganda should appeal to the people emotion@@ ally .
young people are in a special way vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; recently , it had been given reports of several federal states reports on the &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , he did not have any knowledge . &quot;
for the constitutional protection of possible contacts of this species may only be relevant from a certain point .
&quot; it comes to whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - through certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist extrem@@ ist , change its targets and thus extrem@@ ist extrem@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; therefore , whether such people have fiscal impact on the party . &quot;
this is not recognis@@ able .
&quot; with a view to the significant increase of legal crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees , Ma@@ ate said , he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
&quot; yet , in recent years , we have noticed that it can give the ri@@ ghtful structures . &quot;
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Fri@@ end@@ ental group .
&quot; it may well be that other legal entities or small groups form the attacks against asylum seekers , against Refu@@ ge@@ sh@@ ei@@ me or attacks from other right @-@ right motives patterns . &quot;
a German @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of rectangular ror@@ ism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; moreover , Ma@@ ate said that many transgres@@ sions went to the account of men who were not in the right scene in the right scene . &quot;
this is the worrying .
&quot; many of the in@@ susp@@ icious of attacks on asylum seekers were previously not known as criminals , politically motivated criminal offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed crimes committed against right @-@ right @-@ wing popul@@ ists who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example CD@@ U , SPD or Left , who then have radic@@ alised the extrem@@ ist mood . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
it is not always determining the Olympi@@ ad or world cor@@ es the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous appearance of RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer@@ time in Rio de Janeiro .
the Aqu@@ atics Center sw@@ am the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly that he could no longer see in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cli@@ pping was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ it became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a return of 48 seconds on his advance and ended the 5@@ 9th place of 59 starters . &quot;
&quot; but it was rather his not exactly spor@@ tive figure , which attracted the attention of international media . &quot;
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still takes part in the Olympic Games ?
Ethiop@@ ians got a special battle from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ stated countries well known .
&quot; as in Ethiopia , most athletes run , Hab@@ it just wanted to make something different . &quot;
preparing is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ asit is ready for the big race .
quickly made the first nickname for round .
some media recorded it as a &quot; RO@@ BE@@ L of W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; took care of the &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; about him . &quot;
&quot; his time , he only hit a minute and almost five seconds at the 100 meters of Fre@@ estyle , did not play a role . &quot;
&quot; compare with &quot; &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; &quot; were also drawn . &quot;
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took attention to media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ atorial Guinea when he had to move alone in a pad@@ dock over 100 metres of Fre@@ estyle .
m@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was then fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim eight months before Olympia and had never completed a long distance before the competition .

&quot; if nothing should be made with the election to the U.S. President , Donald Tru@@ mp has already had an altern@@ ati@@ st video . &quot;
he then prop@@ elled down to the holiday .
&quot; in the end , Donald Tru@@ mp loses the US presidential election in November , it would be either a small , long holiday , &quot; said the candidate of the Re@@ public@@ ans in a telephone interview with the U.S. television station CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it is not rich for him at the end of reasons for political correctness , be it in order , said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he called on US President Barack Obama and the candidate of Democrats , Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within his party , he recently formed more resistance . &quot;

GF@@ K @-@ leadership steps after dis@@ appoint business figures
the Gf@@ K consumer company Gf@@ K exchanges his head Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the back@@ rest were suddenly coming - but not quite surprising .
&quot; the difficult situation of the Gf@@ K market leader GR@@ P caused that the chair of leader Matthias Hart@@ mann gets more and more secure , the longer the success of the promised success . &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the head of the NÃ¼rn@@ berger Market research scientist Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ appoint business figures and the res@@ ign@@ ation of the company &apos;s company is the global number five in the branch before a person@@ alised new beginning .

who will continue to become market research in the future currently still unclear .
&quot; in An@@ le@@ ger@@ circles , it was on Friday , at the shareholders &apos; shareholders &apos; , last but the disappointment on the continued success of the years ahead of restructuring was great . &quot;
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K tip since 2011 .
&quot; however , the fruits of the restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years . &quot;
&quot; given the last bad Gf@@ K business , every employee will eventually become un@@ quiet . &quot;
&quot; if that would be the case at BMW , this would also be the qu@@ and@@ ts so . &quot;
the company had not able to stop his loss after returns in the pre @-@ quarter in the second quarter of 2016 .

&quot; after a s@@ layer of limestone , the Ab@@ water price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 Euro per cu@@ bic meter . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ hÃ¤user ( CS@@ U ) reported , was found in the approval of the budget by the Kul@@ mb@@ ach Land@@ mb@@ ach , for these wast@@ e@@ water installations . &quot;
the Kas@@ endorf Market is required on the basis of legal foundations to cover the plants cost @-@ covering .
&quot; from 1 October 2016 citizens , as well as the commercial and industrial enterprises of Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the budgets . &quot;
the ag@@ itation increases between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Chairman of the Board of Herbert Schmidt , on the board , was a rec@@ ap@@ ment of fees necessary for se@@ wage systems of the market community . &quot;
&quot; over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ covers and covers from the previous calculation period . &quot;
&quot; the gra@@ zing devi@@ ations founded Schmidt in order that there are all three se@@ wage systems around relatively small facilities , with a very low se@@ wage attack , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; thus , due to the low distribution of distribution , this would have a serious effect for necessary repairs of several thousand Euros . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the waste of water in all three plants is slightly decl@@ ining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the rec@@ u@@ per@@ ation period of all three plants , not least because of its age @-@ re@@ mediation and repair @-@ offs in a substantial scale . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the plant for Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that in the wast@@ e@@ water Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage .
&quot; in the P@@ ump@@ werk Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and in the pond region Lop@@ p had to be installed after nearly 20 years of operation of the first frac@@ tures , the frac@@ tures @-@ spon@@ ge has to be fitted to keep the water @-@ related requirements in the future . &quot;
Schmidt : &quot; on these extraordinary events the advanced supervis@@ or and maintenance costs came to be taken into account in accordance with the new cal@@ ender period .
&quot; the same goes for electricity costs , which at the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 is still significantly under the current level . &quot;
&quot; stone buildings made it clear that with the low wast@@ e@@ water @-@ attack in the three installations the expenditure for the operation and maintenance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; moreover , Schmidt , the market community of major entertainment costs in the past 20 years has spar@@ ed spar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the mentioned systems will continue to be pre@@ valent in the duration of stone buildings , especially since one could not extend the supply of the se@@ wage @-@ con@@ federation of Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal for these installations , because it is dedicated to defic@@ it . &quot;
Bulgaria collap@@ sed for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
&quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) , and the first about zero since October last year , as a positive 0.@@ 2 % bay . &quot;
the annual average de@@ flation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured by the CP@@ I -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
&quot; the consumer prices in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.@@ 0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.@@ 0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was 0.@@ 2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.@@ 2 % .
in July 2016 the following groups of consumer goods are observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1,8 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
&quot; prices fell by clothes and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine issues ( 0.5 % ) ; Health ( 0,1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in the pre @-@ month of alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect cri@@ tici@@ zed as Asian caric@@ ature
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is a anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say that it is uns@@ om@@ able towards breeds . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool , it allows snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that is already adjacent to Ab@@ sur@@ de . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are unver@@ i@@ ous , autonomous tools that generate over 30 million improved selection per day . &quot;
all tr@@ ams are coming to the public .
snap@@ chat @-@ Filter have moved into the past criticism in which they were accused of accused the app Black@@ face shaped or white skin as beauty ideal .
&quot; as it proposed a filter for a filter that gave them sle@@ itz@@ au@@ gen , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , there was a few critics a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature of Asi@@ atic - &quot; yel@@ lowing . &quot; &quot;
they asked whether this repeti@@ tive controversi@@ es appeared on a greater problem that the company has diversity .
&quot; the news and the indign@@ ation were widely used on Wednesday , with reports of The ver@@ ge and motherboard , one day after snap@@ chat had it de@@ ed that it would have de@@ activated the feature . &quot;
the Company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was meant to be a tribute to anim@@ e @-@ characters and not as caric@@ ature of Asian .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism , the filter is reminded of inf@@ ring@@ ing c@@ lich@@ Ã©s . &quot;
others refused the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ et was widely spread over the photos that the filter was hur@@ t@@ ful and gel@@ in@@ de . &quot;
she added that it is difficult to argue with the counter@@ position of a very conflic@@ ting Asian caric@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yellow , but that the yel@@ lowing of the extre@@ mes was pulled off . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crossed this cultural Stol@@ per@@ ate .
&quot; the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ shots of a large audience of young people - who are in matters diversity as their older counter@@ players - could not expect to go beyond sen@@ sibility .
&quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats felt a picture generated that for a user is off@@ ending , &quot; it &apos;s much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who worked as a product director and engineers for medium working , to delete their snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that she believe that race @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the practices of snap@@ chat . &quot;
Z@@ hu cri@@ tici@@ zed the big part white ; only male leaders and ended up with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that are working there , but not in positions where they are safe or good to say what to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that has left the snap@@ chat largely un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish any figures about the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , there was snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural background of his employees , but according to a spokes@@ person , the company has recently set a recruitment agency that focuses on sub@@ missions groups and to internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu said in her turn , that she will be shut down her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that that is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military leadership ha@@ unting ISIS Intelligence Information and introduces the Committee of Congress
&quot; inter @-@ members of the United States Central Command changed text@@ book information in order to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islam@@ ist state in Iraq and Syria when it allowed the actual conditions on site to report a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republican members of the Defense Committee , Secret Services and the Wehr@@ bud@@ get@@ ee , reported on great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command intelligence an@@ alysts who reported as superi@@ ors to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic state . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military formations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; subsequent information presented by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Kom@@ man@@ de@@ marks , typically a positive image of the American efforts against terrorism , as it had allowed the actual conditions on site and have been thoroughly more positive than analyses of other news services , &quot; a newspaper article added to the report . &quot;
&quot; what has happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering if poor analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; he established Ken Cal@@ vert , republi@@ can &apos;s member of the Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the leaders in the Cent@@ Com range up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ sided report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the education of the Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence suggest@@ ing that government peaks have been given below Obama instructions , it shows how an@@ alysts were exposed to the pressure from their laws , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic state , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half year 2015 many Central Command press releases , opinions and statements from Congress were clearly more positive than the facts presented . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com has been publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s were already beginning in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ su@@ l , second @-@ largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investig@@ ations , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ p@@ o , Republican Congress of K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of the year 2014 up to the middle of 2015 , the tips of Central Command changed the after@@ glow reports to record the danger of ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the Re@@ public@@ ans called the Task Force , after it was played , that an@@ alysts are concerned with regard to the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State . &quot;
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while inquiries are continued .
&quot; in addition , further investigation of the Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the General @-@ General Secretary of the Ministry of Defence . &quot;
democratic members of the News Services published on Thursday released their own findings which coinci@@ des with some of the conclusions of Republican Task Force .
&quot; during the years 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of re@@ her@@ etic ass@@ ess@@ ments to IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; this process , such as Mr. ship , &quot; delayed the release of thoughtful reports &quot; , &quot; the morality of an@@ alysts and &quot; gave excessive space for so@@ fter opinions . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. ship and the Democrats gave no indications of an intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ Com An@@ alysts , with regard to a &quot; certain political opinion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Beast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported by investig@@ ators by the general inspec@@ tor of the Pentagon , which were included after complaints by Cent@@ Com An@@ alysts . &quot;
&quot; C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press review of the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment any reports of Congress , while the investigation of the general inspec@@ tions were still in progress . &quot;
&quot; but he also said that &quot; experts sometimes have quite diver@@ ging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence Forces a controversial discussion on these important issues of national defense . &quot;
inquiries made some feedback on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim which has now been made by an increasing number of members of the Department of Defence ) .
&quot; however , the accus@@ ations of the past year have raised the question to what President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest ass@@ ess@@ ments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism regarding the Islam@@ ist state remind of the Islam@@ ist state of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , presented a font from the recommendations of many an@@ alysts , such as the former occupation of the invasion of Iraq and little time on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thoughts . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a pi@@ vot@@ al role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker after providing government proposals to oppose government proposals on the financial situation of the terrorist group had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these Pro@@ visional refin@@ eries were put into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger com@@ man@@ ders , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure for his excessive positive assessment of the war situation in a hearing in front of the Senate . &quot;
general Austin was reti@@ ring in April and was replaced by the Central Command at Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the US has received fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with the UK . &quot;
&quot; one day after they had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday to India that American women won with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember it ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I am not part of the people who keep their goals in mind .
&quot; the white they know however , the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan remain un@@ beaten . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday last round in the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which both within their group of six teams will win the first and second place . &quot;
the first @-@ placed will get a little longer out of the way that the other group will lead .
&quot; whatever the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising host by their success story , four years after it landed in the past London games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
B@@ am was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey r@@ ack@@ et ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years it became the national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olymp@@ ics in 2008 as they could not qualify for the Ka@@ der .
then came the year 2012 in which she and her team went wrong .
&quot; in the next year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team , and thus began to turn things towards better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , an mental change and a bodily change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work@@ book in London that we have now .
we have been able to tear the ruin completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the door@@ mat in the first half of the game with a set@@ back cover from the near @-@ area .
&quot; India had gone without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprising tough and took the game from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until he took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; it carried out a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the center and lu@@ te the ball in the gate around the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 guide . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the door@@ keepers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of Tramp@@ oline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , there are the Olympic Games . &quot;
the events in Rio de Janeiro are stable and in@@ escap@@ ably due to a rapid season between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it &apos;s as if the oly@@ mp@@ ic F@@ ack@@ el itself would be a burning st@@ ab that is passed from the bracel@@ et to the Turner first to become tri@@ athletes .
&quot; you can not switch on the TV to read a paper or listen to the conversation of your neighbor in the queue , without talking about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ ep@@ y or the argument between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a female sch@@ warm by dimples , could quite have been sent under these known names that would be sent to Prime Time , created by sponsors and well @-@ being @-@ TV commerci@@ als if he would be a swi@@ mmer , Turner or even more fen@@ cer . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting for gold in the oly@@ mp@@ ic trampoline . &quot;
the oly@@ mp@@ ic flame does not see any event equally .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally recognized : air gun , ar@@ chery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the chest swim and may it reign for a long time .
&quot; but if I can make humble arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the Tramp@@ ol@@ an event has already been an oly@@ mp@@ ic event , when it had been a debut in Sydney , it was so spar@@ sely noticed that many of whom I had asked , did not know that it is a Olymp@@ ics . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the US has sent athletes to competition , it has never won a medal in tramp@@ ol@@ ines and had a athletes who made it up to the final . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Can@@ adi@@ ans who share the women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; jumping on the trampoline has a certain outdoor char@@ geable char@@ me , partly because it sounds more appropriate for an enlightened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ ist school than that of the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only one enthusi@@ ast enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has humor@@ ous potential - the kar@@ to@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never to end clou@@ dy - but also the grace of the gymn@@ ast and diving , the two sports , which it essentially united . &quot;
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from Spanish El trampoline as much as spr@@ ing@@ board .
&quot; emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land at the feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official Olymp@@ ics , you will be assessed according to the execution , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two @-@ und@@ ous athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio with each other . &quot;
the common oly@@ mp@@ ic vector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ all@@ engers have to continue in their quest for gold , faster , upward , and go over , sometimes to finish , sometimes back and back , upwards and down on the playground . &quot;
they do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall but also in the television trans@@ ference also another height : that of the world or the Olympi@@ ad ords .
&quot; the pur@@ pose@@ ful aspir@@ ation is pos@@ h , admir@@ able , even fan@@ ati@@ cal - and it is enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; but it is also what I think , when looking at these games as something ti@@ res@@ ome . &quot;
&quot; of this , the trampoline offers a re@@ pri@@ eve . &quot;
the vector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she pr@@ all@@ t , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effortlessly again upwards . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during practice there is no hectic attack on the target , no wolves at the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can be .
&quot; qualifying and final clients will take place on Friday in the morning , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; those of the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will show the end of the final section as part of a afternoon from 14@@ .00 .
&quot; in the midst of Olympia Man@@ ie , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked over@@ looked in general turmo@@ il . &quot;
&quot; if the levels of consciousness can only be achieved through the anxiety and the object of male athletes - as it proposed the male US Turner according to The Wall Street Journal , then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits its air rin@@ se , new fans . &quot;
&quot; a generation of protests in Ethiopia , Long a allies of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
protesters who demand political changes in Ethiopia and have a violent resistance to the government .
witnesses say that sixty protesters were killed during the cl@@ ashes with the police when they were killed .
is Ethiopia just going to break down ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid allies of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
but in recent months protests against the government the country and spread out more and more areas .
last week thousands of people w@@ ned on the streets and slow@@ ed fundamental political changes .
&quot; according to human rights , the government &apos;s response was rel@@ ent@@ lessly . &quot;
witnesses mentioned that polic@@ emen were killed on zig un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators and killed .
&quot; in circulation , videos on protests which are probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how safety people are forced to beat young people with staves , while these were forced to make a hand stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN @-@ Authority for Human Rights is now calling for an in @-@ depth investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in future it will even become more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror over the region , especially Somalia . only a few countries in Africa if at all , get so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian economy expan@@ sion@@ ed at considerable pace .
his infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital of Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; the streets are generally quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continually led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited , the dissi@@ dents are effective to silence . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ se of the desert . &quot;
yet this could change .
&quot; when you supp@@ ress people and these have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lectur@@ er in central Ethiopia . &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the floor to the stran@@ gle@@ hold in terms of power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a continued election election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time tensions along the border to Eritrea are rising ; a fight for these jag@@ ged , controversial line called on June hundreds of lives . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which were forced more or less imposed over the last few years , would benefit the turbul@@ ences and re@@ tired . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of the bitter@@ ness after years of the her@@ seals under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate through social media as the cheaper smartphone were getting more and more frequent and improved the Internet services . &quot;
&quot; even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does in regular intervals , especially with protests , many people still can communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide from where they stop . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians have believed that they gathered themselves up to protest .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; e@@ ons since e@@ ons prosp@@ ered the Am@@ har@@ as , which come from Ethiopia , mainly Christian powers , in politics and economy , while the Oro@@ mos exploited , many of whom are living and living in flat @-@ areas . &quot;
but also this is changing .
&quot; we are here to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray that accounts for around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in the year 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as tactical genius , a man who could think around the corners . &quot;
&quot; an@@ alysts say that he was particularly prescribed , to use early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and instruc@@ ted to handle opponents and to make them harmless . &quot;
&quot; in the current regime there is a lack of skill , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ tic . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected from relatively un@@ transparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray Region North @-@ Ethiop@@ ian region , Mr. Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am comes from south . &quot;
analy@@ st tell us that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia was living for such a turmo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands of elections were prot@@ ested from the government and were then stolen by the government and subsequently stolen it . &quot;
&quot; during the following ra@@ ids , many protesters were killed , even if it were less than in the last few months and this time of un@@ rest was gone relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ian Ethiop@@ ian Ethiop@@ ian leader for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new P@@ end@@ ow@@ ler , as well as for their measurable progress on poverty allevi@@ ation . &quot;
but obviously this has not prevented any intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ understanding of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and she takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month of protests in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ id@@ lic city , of Tig@@ ray @-@ guided shops , and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in the social media . &quot;
analy@@ st tell that protests bring the US and other Western allies to a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if it was recently closed , that it has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West wants to support democracy clearly , he does not want its allies to collapse in an already volati@@ le area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin gr@@ at@@ walk . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his asser@@ tion Obama was founded ISIS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to dissi@@ p@@ ate the last controversy that surrounds his campaign by turning his multiple repeated claim , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton were the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State , not serious . &quot;
this clari@@ fying clear questions about the communication skills of the presidential race for the Re@@ public@@ ans on whether it is able to communicate clearly and understandable to the American public .
&quot; it also brings his fellow @-@ mates who seek to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protecting the peculiar position , statements which he could not have been meant . &quot;
&quot; after he had made the clear@@ ance at an election event on Wednesday night , Mr. Tru@@ mp had returned to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate the President and Mrs. Clinton had made ISIS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was just sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et was opposite to the previous day when Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a number of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation completely serious . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative Radi@@ om@@ o@@ der@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ witt Mr. Tru@@ mp , he wanted to weak@@ en the statement of something that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the Republican presidential campaign wanted nothing to know about it . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of critic@@ isms pr@@ as@@ sel@@ t down to Mr. Tru@@ mp , while he is trying to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling conversion levels to the economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return again to this topic .
&quot; on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Cl@@ int@@ ons &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already introduced sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he moved strong criticism to himself when he said , the Russians were to cho@@ p Mrs. Cl@@ int@@ ons e @-@ mails , but he said later &quot; Of course I said the sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to shift the language boundaries in politics and then return after demand .
&quot; I think it is one of its methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans , as they arrive , and then if necessary &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication experts who observe the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I think also , he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ age enough to be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of resol@@ ute the sound of the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has assumed an even track of its sound , as its surveys have gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published on Friday , showed a leading lead in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ in @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp in general tries to excuse for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he acc@@ uses his critics frequently to distorted his statements or to understand his humor . &quot;
&quot; but while he is strengthening the focus of attention during the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal fellow @-@ mates to the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative might be his statements . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s most prominent speakers , gave great effort to defend candidates today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani so he asked to the accuracy of Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama was a almost unknown , small organization , he called them Le@@ b@@ Ã¤n@@ kler , completely wrong and therefore it happened , because he moved the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most of the mainstre@@ am Re@@ public@@ ans attempt to argue that the government used under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as an Secretary of State , it is allowed to spread out to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and cast them off on each of his words to ride him and be taken against him . &quot;
&quot; he de@@ cks the &quot; poor , j@@ atro@@ city &quot; television professionals who are trying to understand and said , &quot; &quot; They cannot ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked over Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s excuse us as merely a further proof that he was in@@ appropriate for the presidential office .
&quot; once pushed the price of the market , cafÃ© is coming back to Green@@ point . &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a s@@ hab@@ itable cafÃ© in William@@ sburg , where one could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years it was a good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front was pushed . &quot;
&quot; So@@ ap Cher@@ ie &apos;s business Cher@@ ie , which was put in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of Cup@@ cakes . &quot;
indigenous people saw it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is except a soap business . &quot;
&quot; but when New York change is , it is also new . &quot;
&quot; a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing staff of the old cafes , the owner and manager of the new cafÃ© . &quot;
he began to work in 2001 at Ver@@ b and remained there until the end .
&quot; when he offered him a customer to provide money for a new out@@ sider , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ guez , 36 , be@@ held a lot . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so @-@ plate .
it even uses the same lamps from the old Ver@@ b .
&quot; but Rodri@@ guez said , he wanted to experiment . &quot;
he led new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are Gar@@ ni@@ cs like cap@@ ers and su@@ mp@@ ed onions .
there are natural bowls .
&quot; the cafÃ© serves no beer more , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
after nine months Rodri@@ guez said that he had noticed a st@@ amped power on old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also driven by awards from William@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way to himself . &quot;
&quot; after the verb had closed , she gave a while the coffee to the coffee , she said . &quot;
&quot; I realized that it was the coffee and the culture in the verb that fell to me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she has coffee , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea in this day instead of their usual ing@@ coffee , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal since the beginning of 2003 was another long@@ time and faithful customer .
he went there before work and ordered an in@@ vari@@ ance always being the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss watch , and they prepare my hair @-@ Ba@@ gel with butter &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and create new ingredients in the menu .
&quot; today Ros@@ enthal gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his hair @-@ Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez said that he has no bo@@ ast about it that the soap @-@ business has taken the old business space .
&quot; indeed , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold @-@ ro@@ asted coffee of the coffee cafÃ© as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points are also accepted the cafÃ© . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated into the Polish menu and Rodri@@ guez said he decided to deliver them soon , so that his new neighbors feel welcome . &quot;
the site also has further advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ locally would like to fill the cold @-@ fried coffee to the bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the cafÃ© is expanding to an adjoining building .
for many customers a new bu@@ b is sufficient to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a pedi@@ gree and said he was destroyed at the ground when the cafÃ© closed .
&quot; when the new cafÃ© opened , Wh@@ itt said that the local locality and the stocks of a new coffee felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell the smell , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the depres@@ sing food of the economic crisis in &quot; any abundant meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his climb to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano participated in the O@@ val office . &quot;
as a gour@@ mets President Roosevelt had a Fai@@ ble for refined delic@@ acy of Fifth Avenue like P@@ Ã¢@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water @-@ turtle sou@@ ps .
&quot; his menu on this day was a little more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato p@@ ushes and as dessert a pl@@ ums pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of gastronomic solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans , as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ker .
&quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; acted by the Chinese kitchen in the USA , while pulling in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food @-@ view . &quot;
&quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustr@@ ates the history of American cuisine during Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity , when they met with a re@@ porter in Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , fri@@ lls snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh k@@ es@@ and@@ wich with olive oil , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable @-@ mixture ate . &quot;
as the re@@ porter chi@@ ro@@ ast ordered this was the pair of discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ anu@@ ts , liver and sa@@ vory . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient .
&quot; imagine , so many pe@@ anu@@ ts eat to eat that they serve them as dinners . &quot;
Co@@ E gr@@ in@@ ste .
&quot; it has to have laid out in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ buffet . &quot;
&quot; cre@@ ws of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served fresh@@ ly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; there were the Americans , who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the first World War . &quot; &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; draws the paths to which the country went with it , no longer the Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ en@@ land . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans became a central , tense topic , &quot; beg@@ ged co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new bud@@ get@@ ary was just as tense : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and cas@@ asser@@ tion were made to stap@@ le foods , the C@@ asser@@ ol@@ le , as &quot; wonderful way , the food waste , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man , since KÃ¶@@ che was able to hide in@@ appe@@ able ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheap dr@@ y@@ dry .
&quot; meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury . &quot;
&quot; peculiar distr@@ acts have been tried , since a low @-@ calorie and nutritious satisfaction had priority to taste or even healthy kitchen . &quot;
&quot; during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man made a dish from this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition to lunch , &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man continued : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions are not fit together .
it was typical for many of the home economic recipes .
&quot; never before or since then , bud@@ get@@ ters - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country like never before . &quot;
&quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; household policy &quot; &quot; and the challenge , pamp@@ e as cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots in delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historical ti@@ d@@ bits .
&quot; in particular , the reports on the response of the government to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ C@@ ake &apos;s food attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he praised the simple Iowa farmer &apos;s kitchen in its kitchen , he ate like the million@@ aire @-@ heavy man of the world to which it has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in a almost gold @-@ gold @-@ room and carried a smo@@ king .
he was del@@ ici@@ ously more realistic .
&quot; President Roosevelt was perhaps committed to the same mistakes , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to stat@@ ute his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the fam@@ ines of a house@@ keeper made no interest in flavours through Mrs. Roosevelt , that the White House provided the boring food in Washington , but also one of the most ble@@ ak prepared . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , to deal with food , was rejected as soon as the land came back to the legs . &quot;
&quot; legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to food items . &quot;
the couple gave better understand the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ mans @-@ in @-@ law better - for example how they could not throw food away .
&quot; she had a real fear of the extravag@@ ance of food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; it was rec@@ alled , &quot; &quot; They made people sick . &quot;
there was the wind @-@ drop .
&quot; after the plates had left off at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they moved and co@@ e to have a dessert that had dressed it at home : the pl@@ ums , the President Roosevelt , ate for lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a common trick , humble recipes to miss a name . &quot;
&quot; there was no sli@@ pped cream , just pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone turns a bit reluct@@ antly to a spoon in the tough , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad . &quot;
Co@@ E three times took a break .
like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ zer he said to his wife , &quot; A few ch@@ opped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in Bom@@ bs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others the lives .
&quot; now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself is dead in a barrel bomb attack of the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; Omar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil servants , which saved the lives according to picture @-@ newspaper nearly 60,000 people . &quot;
&quot; 2@@ 900 volunteers are putting their own lives up to play , to draw people from their homes and to make the first aid in the war . &quot;
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civil war which shows him in a 11 hour saving of infants from the ruins of a house went in 2014 around the world .
it made the Syri@@ ans to illumin@@ ating symbols in the Gre@@ ys of war .
&quot; but as a hero , he never saw himself , said according to image : &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I am dying , save life , I think that God sees a mar@@ ty@@ r . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bombar@@ d@@ ment of Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Heli@@ kop@@ ter have thrown four F@@ ass@@ bom@@ b@@ ben over the Alz@@ adia District , one of chlor@@ gas was filled with chlor@@ ella . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ n@@ ants of the bomb , so that not children play with it , c@@ ites the picture his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
GrÃ¶n@@ land@@ hai : the oldest cycl@@ ist is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
GrÃ¶n@@ land@@ ha@@ ie come most often only in winter to surface .
this shar@@ k was allowed after an investigation on board the Forschungs@@ schi@@ ffs S@@ anna back to the sea .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and s@@ wimm@@ t with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
GrÃ¶n@@ land@@ ha@@ ie got only 150 years of offspring .
&quot; while the GrÃ¶n@@ land@@ hai flo@@ ats along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is at an average of just 1.@@ 220 meters far . &quot;
&quot; only when it comes to it , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates on around 2,@@ 6 km / h - and with this top speed , half as fast as a ro@@ be . &quot;
this one of slow@@ ness on the way of life seems to be a pan@@ acea for a high age .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report to the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate of a Greenland , which could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
madness &quot; comments Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ than@@ king by Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this life span which means to verteb@@ rates a world record .
&quot; indeed , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist already suspected that Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks are st@@ ony . &quot;
only missing the evidence .
&quot; GrÃ¶n@@ land@@ ha@@ ie are difficult to observe , eventually they live mainly in the ice @-@ sea facing the spar@@ sely populated co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitz@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually dive in the surface only in winter . &quot;
&quot; on the li@@ festyles of Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks , researchers know very little . &quot;
their time lu@@ gs were du@@ ped up at the same time when they killed six animals with a transmitter .
&quot; loot : this shar@@ ks nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bones of a young ice @-@ bears . &quot;
&quot; possibly , they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice cream and are looking for car@@ c@@ asses , which are from higher layers of layers below tor@@ tur@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks , which Fischer studied between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitz@@ bergen as co @-@ catching from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cen@@ tim@@ etres long , while the greatest 50@@ 2 cen@@ tim@@ etres . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens @-@ 14 method with the lens @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens is already created before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed . &quot;
the two smallest ha@@ ie had a striking carbon @-@ 14 in the lens .
&quot; however , their birth should lie after the early 1960s , as an atomic weapon , larger amounts of this radio@@ active carbon dioxide into the atmosphere sh@@ at@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; in the length of 220 cen@@ tim@@ etres in length of the smallest animal contained the lens , against a low excess of carbon @-@ 14 out of the nuclear weapons , it might have celebrated his 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
all major Greenland ha@@ ie had in its lens against normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts caused by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock for a 4@@ 93 centimeters long Greenland shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , during the record @-@ shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimeters even 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females only then got after@@ no@@ bles when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers of the length were able to arrange an age . &quot;
&quot; as one of the animals of 3@@ 92 centimeters probably stood on the threshold to the sexually mature ejaculation and his age has been determined with 156 years , GrÃ¶n@@ land ha@@ ie with the multip@@ lication is obviously at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
this is likely to be normal for verteb@@ rates .
&quot; such methane hydr@@ ates mainly live in icy waters , is no coincidence . &quot;
&quot; also the previous record @-@ holder , a 211 year old Greenland back , in whose sp@@ eck at the neck , an 120 year old har@@ po@@ sp@@ ear@@ ed was caught before Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , it is also common also the organism of the animals living there on savings . &quot;
they mature just later - and al@@ ters slower .
&quot; in order to keep cold in cold water , the animals are often particularly large . &quot;
&quot; because the volume grows much faster than its surface , which allows the animal heat . &quot;
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; so a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on it as early as possible , as early as possible as many descendants as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ eu@@ than@@ lein . &quot;
a very big animal should invest more into a long life on the other hand .
building floor in the double @-@ pack
&quot; with topics around the building , the community council in recent session has been wei@@ ght@@ fully concerned . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the panel took on the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the youngest dwelling places can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the property , Par@@ cel@@ li@@ fication and closure issues were clari@@ fied and the applications for measurement of measurement could be placed on the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; &quot; Stre@@ et@@ weg &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; SchÃ¶n@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; ( Section Bin@@ der@@ straÃe - Out@@ line 1 ) interested parties nothing more in the way . &quot;
the council is convinced that the ben@@ ches are in the rural and quiet residential community SchÃ¶n@@ au young families and touching sen@@ iors alike .
&quot; as it meant , construction will be able to sign up in the town hall , via the allocation of the par@@ c@@ els , the municipal council will probably be advised in his September session . &quot;
&quot; to also en@@ core other commercial enterprises , connected to the creation of jobs , in the spring of this year , the council decided to re @-@ set up newly created plan training plan in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , in the area of under@@ time the commercial trade area is extended by two par@@ c@@ els towards the state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
&quot; the City on the Main , thus , in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg decided to attract the best opportunities to attract new jobs and companies . &quot;
&quot; it is most likely that Frankfurt benef@@ ited most from the Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ arians , head of the competence of competence and real estate markets of I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether money houses will continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU @-@ Pass , it is far enough for approval in the UK . &quot;
this just uses major US banks .
several banks have already announced their jobs .
the lob@@ by@@ association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; expects 10,000 new jobs at the Main Event in five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , I speak the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , united responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks of the euro area , as well as other key authorities such as European insurance coverage , ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) have become less significant for the financial industry less significant than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the staff bank is important to banks , since they can communicate so directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; Luxembourg native to a big fund branch , but also cut off in the infrastructure as Dublin as Dublin . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach in Frankfurt thanks to the great airport .
furthermore the city with easily available commercial property .
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ onian . &quot;
&quot; at the Seine , the tenants for first @-@ class commercial property is 50 percent higher than on the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offer a higher quality of life as the competition with good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the company consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city stand in place seven , Luxembourg at No. 19 , Dublin on Square 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market , Frankfurt could draw further banks and investors , &quot; &quot; says I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; but London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Bre@@ xit , the most important financial centre in Europe . &quot;
&quot; the forces of power also speak about 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking industry in the end of 2015 at the end of 2015 around 14@@ 4000 people in the banking sector , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C sponsor@@ ing with Mer@@ ck
&quot; a US termin@@ ator decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to the re@@ im@@ bur@@ sement of legal costs , which were created from the he@@ pat@@ ati@@ ts C law@@ suit with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc . &quot;
&quot; in June , Gilead was fre@@ ed from a claim of compensation in the amount of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , after a US judge in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs So@@ val@@ di and Har@@ v@@ oni of Gilead , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other atyp@@ ical actions . &quot;
&quot; upon arrival of law@@ suit on Thursday said US @-@ minister@@ ial in Beth Ho@@ son Fre@@ eman , that Gilead is entitled to surrender of the cost , which were created during the defence of the F@@ alles . &quot;
Mer@@ ck is trying to compens@@ ate with Gilead to control the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
&quot; the case goes back to the year 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck were mutually respected and property on laboratory work , the So@@ f@@ os@@ bu@@ vir ac@@ orn , active ingredient in the medication of Gilead . &quot;

&quot; previously , many speakers have used to defend themselves . &quot;
Friday is a telephone day dedicated to animal protection .

&quot; Jewish director defeats the Berliner Hotel , because Israeli re@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; request - RT News &quot;
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots , a media f@@ ath@@ lon , after having betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had no Israeli code , since the Arabic guests had requested a staff &quot; according to an employee &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Claude Lan@@ z@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentation &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; wrote his trouble in Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin , following an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lan@@ z@@ mann tried to find Israel on the coun@@ ten@@ ance list of the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed between the countries that can be accessed directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lan@@ z@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol has a way to choose Israel on its own call center . &quot;
&quot; following an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; cho@@ ed him , &quot; as Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel was said that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision by the management of Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
&quot; the reason behind it stood , ext@@ ingu@@ ished in the director even more anger . &quot;
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , the employees of Lan@@ z@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das was called a &quot; &quot; great shame &quot; , &quot; the SÃ¼d@@ deutsche Zeitung reports . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and pl@@ ung@@ ed by this event .
this is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
&quot; the fact that this has been borne in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , is even an even greater dis@@ grace . &quot;
this does not require an explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident ext@@ ingu@@ ished a fairly large resonance on the internet , in which people called the whole sc@@ andal . &quot;
some set up the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had been given to the alleged aff@@ or@@ ations of Arab guests .
&quot; ashamed of you , &quot; &quot; was it in a different article , in which pointed out that the hotel , which is located on the cl@@ assy Kur@@ fÃ¼r@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly showed all alleg@@ ations of itself and called the incident &quot; &quot; See &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; &quot; with Lan@@ z@@ mann , reports the mirror . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct order , &quot; &quot; Israel did not include into the high@@ lands , &quot; &quot; the SÃ¼d@@ deutsche Zeitung proclaimed a speaker of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
it adds that the country code was now added .

&quot; students come together on Thursday in the Brazilian city Sao Paulo with the police , when they gathered together to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for public education system . &quot;
the police replaced Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ as and Gum@@ mi@@ ties against the protesters .
the difficulties began as police officers tried to diver@@ t the students about what led to the police of Gum@@ mi@@ ties and Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ as .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation over the plans .
&quot; according to the proposals by the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the protesters were seen Gra@@ ff@@ i@@ tits against the preliminary President of Michel T@@ emer in walls .

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly increases 71 % - RT Business
&quot; the lifting of sanctions grew out according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade agreement between Moscow and Te@@ hran in the year by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since international sanctions against Iran have been abol@@ ished , the interest in Russian companies has strongly increased to businesses in the country , divided the Ambassador . &quot;
&quot; Russian companies take existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market . &quot;
&quot; of course , the further trade of trade is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan said . &quot;
he noted that trade agreement between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and was $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , the Russian imports rose to Iran by 9@@ 1.5 percent and bet@@ ru@@ gen $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade agreement was achieved by deliveries of machines , vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year the Russian foreign representatives were around 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel , to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries that affects the tourist population in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers in Russia will be broken down from the last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the Ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; personally , I can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ raz and Y@@ az@@ d to receive the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;

the Min@@ ist@@ rants from the past@@ oral unit of E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on their way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were dealt with . &quot;
&quot; in order to pass the time up to the next Rom@@ ot of all min@@ ist@@ rants during two years , the Ober@@ min@@ ist@@ ran@@ ged round St. Anna has decided to prepare and implement a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; several pilgrimage goals was checked and was finally decided for the Ep@@ is@@ cop@@ ic city of Freiburg , where this year of Mer@@ cy was offered mercy on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy on the occasion of mercy on the Frei@@ burger MÃ¼nster . &quot;

&quot; from Hor@@ b , it was driven by train to the starting point of Vill@@ ingen , where the MÃ¼nster of Our Lady has stood and so the pilgrimage was taken away from the MÃ¼nster . &quot;
&quot; each day @-@ day tours were collected in the morning and in the evening , depending on a brief impulse with various prayers , songs and texts . &quot;

Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med home as Br@@ ite Gold won for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last evening in the male team @-@ Spr@@ int in Vel@@ o@@ rom in Rio to glory when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor roller , which had made his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the young and made the legend proud , when he stor@@ med back home to a victory from the favorites New Zealand . &quot;
England claimed four years ago a shocking victory while Ho@@ y fet@@ ched the fifth of six Olymp@@ ics .
&quot; you repeated the trick , after she took place in March by the train champi@@ on@@ ships in London despite the res@@ ign@@ ation Ho@@ ys , only a modest sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this time in time as Hin@@ der .
Ho@@ ys retirement got a gap that K@@ ian E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ ampton tried to close .
&quot; Sk@@ inner was the man , with whom they remained , when they saw the potential in the Sc@@ ots , which has now developed . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ y , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner put a Olymp@@ ics in the Quali@@ fier , but in the Stand@@ ing @-@ unden , the New Zealand courses won in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; returning after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner stopped . &quot;
&quot; a strategic change made a great deal of transformation , in which it was driving in a higher course to de@@ cel@@ er@@ ate it and allow it Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the tempo . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked from his position as BBC expert , and fell in Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der , when they came up on the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am just here to do my best and to make a name for me .
we spent a Olymp@@ ics in the En@@ dr@@ unde and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 on the side Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys said he fell on the train after a weak start .
he returned later and there was no objection to England .
&quot; with such an over@@ ra@@ ved victory , this time there was no such problem . &quot;
&quot; said : &quot; &quot; it feels all the UK flags on the jer@@ king like London . &quot;
we have joined the team in the last three months .
&quot; we have come so badly with so many world titles , that it was incredible to win back at the Olymp@@ ics . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were seven from 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
if such a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the past five months is that we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form Kenn@@ y it is in the realm of the possible that he has repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic medals in a competition .
&quot; that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( an apparently hom@@ ey date for the British sport ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger B@@ ann@@ ister were born ) - an Aus@@ ute of six gold medals and a silver medals . &quot;
the mar@@ vel of the people of Ho@@ y alike .
&quot; Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int , who starts today and will go over three days . &quot;
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
&quot; it feels something lonely , alone to win . &quot;
&quot; said : &quot; &quot; if he wins two other gold medals , he should be hit the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were more good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified himself with the fastest performance in the Vi@@ erer @-@ four mi@@ leage race . &quot;
they arrived at 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 in the destination .
&quot; the World Cup , which was awarded in 2012 in London was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22 / 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition , at which Wig@@ gins will focus on safety in the focus . &quot;
&quot; yesterday he had ended the qualification before the qualification , when the function@@ aries called him to measure his body size . &quot;
&quot; in the corresponding female competition , the morning continued and ended , av@@ anced Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ soon of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world war period in 4 : 13.@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team rel@@ ies on his strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and bring a shame to medals .
&quot; after a truly exceptional display of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were run down . &quot;
&quot; drama was in the background , leaving the res@@ ign@@ ation of the technical guiding Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and mo@@ bbing , as well as retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ leton . &quot;
&quot; however , when one sees itself the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the now famous reputation of G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment . &quot;
future of the m@@ elt from Portland due to the lifting of the energy provider
&quot; the future of aluminum fro@@ ze from Portland in Victoria , as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - are available on the game , since the system operator will announce the energy contract and thus the delivery of delivery will be eliminated , as the supplier &apos;s supplier . &quot;
&quot; this step followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies for the operation of the plant . &quot;
one for 20 years fixed sub@@ title will be held in November .
&quot; up to 2000 jobs in the facility of Al@@ coa in Portland , are on the stake . &quot;
no less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk at risk .
&quot; in addition , it might come to domin@@ ance @-@ effects since the melting shop is consumed around 10 per cent of the total electricity generation Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry melting , which led last year for a closure of the an@@ es@@ ea power station . &quot;
the melting shop of Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and risk close .
&quot; this step follows the long @-@ term spec@@ ulations with regard to the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which provides the major aluminum versions with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , shared with that three other owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the complex is based in a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , where the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p can hold smaller portions . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Portland continues to be operated in Portland , which means a further physical demand for electricity by the m@@ elt , shared the company . &quot;
AG@@ L continued to be convinced that the contracts of &quot; securing transactions &quot; should have been carried out in force from November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the fiscal year 17 will be contributing to the revenue , &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
all potential impact on earnings on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong financial markets for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L shared with the value of contracts in the amount of $ 187 million in the anticip@@ ation of a cancellation .
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; &quot; Al@@ co@@ as ... the melting shop , or to guarantee the power supply to the furn@@ aces &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the U.S. company said that in 2010 it has completed a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have come into effect from November this year , even though it is still a statement that has been raised by the contract . &quot;
analy@@ st warn of the bad economic conditions of the branch off the possible closure of Portland melting shop in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago complex near New@@ castle .
&quot; reference to the statements of analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland &apos;s head of around 600 mega@@ watts and Tom@@ ago consume around 900 mega@@ watts in electricity every year . &quot;
&quot; if both plants disappear from the market , it would mean considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; power market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generator , this would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; this represents the kl@@ is@@ che@@ e@@ hairy action for almost every birthday person ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You can@@ did that we could have forgotten ? &quot; , &quot; with the honesty of a cartoon at 8 am ) , but Kris did not have to participate in this publi@@ city . &quot;
with a view to the new edition of the Vo@@ gue certainly has started a new era of kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an .
&quot; K@@ end@@ om big sister Kim likes them , as for the Vo@@ gue cover , have struck ( her and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the new edition of the magazine is a League for itself . &quot;
the sep@@ tum issue is the most mostly sold issue of the year .
&quot; similar to a circum@@ ference that resembles rather a picture @-@ band as a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of adverti@@ sers ( Acc@@ ording to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista ) from the 8@@ 32 pages of the grove ( 6@@ 15 pages of advertising ) . &quot;
the disclosure of his co@@ ach@@ stars is anticipated that in the last two years pictures of the magazine are subject to the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , there were clearly more &quot; celebrities &quot; the mod@@ alities &quot; as &quot; mod@@ els , &quot; the celebrities &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or @-@ bran@@ ding Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , one year after the Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even with the low probability that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; break@@ age model &quot; &quot; of their generation - the earlier category falls , it is in good company . &quot;
&quot; these celebrities are not related to famous persons or Reality Stars or young people of today who know how to rot@@ ate a good snapshot video ( even if everything is true on Jen@@ ner &apos;s ) . &quot;
they are truly talented women who are able to draw up in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once was published on the last cover with the announcement of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers did not like success to anyone . &quot;
with its Reality @-@ TV @-@ story J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position was always tense in the fashion world .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called her &quot; the pieces of the moment . &quot;
these feelings were again high when the message came out with the show J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
&quot; but on the mis@@ sm@@ ite , riding seems to be stopped at the point . &quot;
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the true sense of the word a super@@ model .
it is running for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters will sell you pictures of their respective Pay@@ r Apps .
she sells her pictures from C@@ ind@@ y Craw@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine .
and in her leisure time she is at the Reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
&quot; common centers include 16@@ 0.000 people every year onwards , &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0.000 in the country &apos;s most aid centers are rejected annually by the common@@ place centers , while the industry is foc@@ us@@ sed on the impact of further medi@@ tations on already existing transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Queensland , three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ ici@@ on@@ ings and those who have no means for un@@ just dolphins and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ crowded , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; from June next year , it is intended that these centers will lose another 30 percent of its federal funding . &quot;
the director of the common@@ wealth of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Joint Council were reported that thousands of people had been rejected every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation without the abolition of the resolution of the federal government would only be worse .
&quot; Queens@@ land common@@ wealth centers are chronic , which means thousands of people of important services you need to be rejected . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relations , people with uns@@ ur@@ pass@@ able and oppres@@ sive debts , families who were released by separ@@ ations , workers , the un@@ just ways , and this survey shows that they can not get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent as of June 2017 , which means thousands of helpl@@ ess people from Queensland to be forced to access their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we invite the German Federal Ministry and Federal Foreign Minister and Sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to raise these c@@ ari@@ ties immediately , so that people may need the help they need , in legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the provincial government filled their commitment to raise funds for guidance on the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their client , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k is investing in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp Elec@@ tive campaign indic@@ ted after employees supposedly moved
&quot; new York : Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign has been indic@@ ted because of alleged in@@ activity , after it has been told that their campaign manager for North Carolina has been on an employee when she was in February in a je@@ ep . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment , submitted on Wednesday in the Landes@@ bank of Charlotte by Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software program@@ er for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; on board , Bord@@ ini gave it to have been waiting for months that the matter would be regulated internally before it realized that &quot; that would not happen . &quot;
&quot; the campaign manager , Earl Philip , &quot; moved a gun , laid his right hand on the de@@ duction , and re@@ tar@@ te the run in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; gave Bord@@ ini in his accus@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; after he had compl@@ ained on the local and regional fight line , Bord@@ ini noted that already at least four other people had the same experience with Philli@@ p , he held in the indictment . &quot;
weapons must not be fired in order to cause harm .
&quot; the accus@@ ation occurs only two days after the Republican presidential elections , as he said to be a crowd in North Carolina , that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - Sch@@ uss@@ weapon @-@ owner and weapon @-@ findings - measures should take action if his Ri@@ val@@ in Hill@@ ary Clinton should be elected and judges . &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign was clear that the media had ri@@ pped his words from the context and that he would not interfere with violence .
B@@ ordin@@ is complaint demands damages from the campaign to breach the duty of duty and Philip due to bodily harm and abi@@ ding mental damage .
Tru@@ mp@@ s Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher@@ in Hope H@@ icks was not to be reached for an opinion .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey of European elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
for the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) substantial losses for the government &apos;s government parties and the CD@@ U are .
this revealed representative surveys from the IN@@ SA into the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government in the north barely go@@ vern barely any further , this is not possible after the survey in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both Bundes@@ lÃ¤nder , the SPD would be the strongest party and thus would have good opportunities to continue to government head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD interven@@ ed by 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent in five years ago on 24 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the Party focused only just ahead of the CD@@ U , who could come back to 23 per cent again . &quot;
the third place is controversial between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left , left in 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , Af@@ D would represent 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s day . &quot;
&quot; in spite of light losses , in spite of light losses with 6 percent ( previous 7 per cent ) , again in the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented by 3 per cent in the country &apos;s day .
&quot; in Berlin , the survey of the survey was reported only to 23 percent ( election 2011 : 2@@ 8.3 % ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent to 2@@ 3.4 percent .
they are still behind the Gre@@ ens by 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) but in front of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 per cent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
&quot; with 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope to return to a return , the pirates would not miss the deposit in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9@@ 000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and internet in time lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia communic@@ ator got on the market .
the success@@ ors today dominate the world - his producer experienced a disaster .
the device wei@@ gh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thicker and bigger , so it was not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was pretty en@@ du@@ sty . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ gab@@ y@@ tes , which would be sufficient for approximately two sel@@ ors with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9@@ 000 communic@@ ator &quot; was over 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few Euro , lovers can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they are somehow derived from the time @-@ time of the internet . &quot;
but 20 years ago the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier on the computer trade fair in Hannover as an &quot; office in the West@@ phal@@ ia &quot; format .
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone was able to get a lot : SMS and emails could be sent and received , also by fax was the communic@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; even the access to websites was possible via HTML @-@ browser , albeit agon@@ izing slowly . &quot;
&quot; a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone was similar to a laptop . &quot;
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen found .
&quot; the price was pretty proud of the price : 2@@ 700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average sales price of a smart phones in Germany was at 3@@ 92 euros .
nobody was able to think in August 1996 that communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone .
since then everything is different .
&quot; teleph@@ ones are a success story , although not for Nokia . &quot;
&quot; the cell @-@ saving of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold and wrapped in Microsoft . &quot;
today the market dominate suppliers that all come a lot later than Nokia .
&quot; always and everywhere online , this is today for a lot of people everyday . &quot;
in 2015 there were nearly two billion smartphone users around the world .
about 1.4 billion devices have been sold on Samsung and Apple ( 5@@ 55 million pieces ) .
global sales with the devices is approximately 400 billion euros .
&quot; in addition , the well @-@ running shops of the countless app @-@ providers and telecommunications companies come . &quot;
&quot; around the smartphone , a whole industry has now been created . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , then the Apple @-@ boss Steve Jobs announced on the Mac World launch of the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communic@@ ator , all easy to use by touch screen . &quot;
&quot; the si@@ ll of Apple began , today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the look . &quot;
&quot; finally , you disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the sa@@ wing now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after its invention a self @-@ evident .
on the cut today every German now sees 88 times a day on his cell phone .
&quot; we must all learn that smartphone also takes away from the smartphone , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens @-@ Board of Management . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must guide the oly@@ mp@@ ic spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row
&quot; He@@ ath@@ row will not only grow in our local communities and in the whole of London , but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; for me this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ rows , just as it was in 2012 in London , when we held a great deal of effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and we will be back by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; for our local communities , we will have already established 10,000 new appren@@ tices in order to create some 40,000 new jobs and make an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who think the challenge of enlargement He@@ ath@@ rows is too big . &quot;
&quot; I have been said that England will never be ready for the games and , that we will be bl@@ am@@ using on the world stage . &quot;
the two @-@ f@@ ists were wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to over@@ coming but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question .
like the Olympic Games He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual a infrastructure project .
&quot; enlargement is a way to create up to 18@@ 0@@ ,000 new jobs , Â£ 211 billion in real growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and in the whole UK . &quot;
&quot; we have implemented a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a Â£ 11 billion expensive infrastructure program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal was built up to the T@@ 2 , which was built in the midst of two frequ@@ ented walks of the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third drive , which is supported by Â£ 16 billion in private investments . &quot;
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the enlargement of He@@ ath@@ row will be one .
it is time that we direct this oly@@ mp@@ ic spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row as well as creating our future business and create a legacy of skills and employment to be proud of the England .

block Plus to block Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and Maus@@ spiel &quot; regarding ad @-@ blocking
&quot; for companies that earn money with online money , according to one of the software publishers attempts to handle ad block , a &quot; &quot; K@@ atz@@ - and Maus@@ spiel &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block scor@@ ching on its des@@ k@@ top@@ side , Ad@@ block plus a blog post , where it we@@ ary to update their filters in the program to block advertisements in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday Facebook , Facebook with that his des@@ k@@ top@@ side would change the co@@ ding with regard to his advertisements , to display it scor@@ ching the detection on which part of the site is advertising to make it difficult to detect . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to handle the new codes .
&quot; in a blog post , the speaker of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ und @-@ H@@ er @-@ battle between the showing open source community and the envel@@ opes are underway since the invention of adverti@@ sers in progress , and that Facebook is soon to come with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world @-@ largest company dedicated to social media in the struggle is a strong indication of how worrying adverti@@ sers have become for the industry .
&quot; according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ j@@ air and Adobe at 200 million people &apos;s display loos@@ ening , almost four times as much as 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1,@@ 03 billion daily active users , which access Facebook through their mobile devices , makes hand@@ y@@ cam 84 per cent of value @-@ based fac@@ ebooks . &quot;
&quot; the company has no effect on display block block@@ ers on desktop PCs , as mobile display blocking no effect on fac@@ ebooks mobil@@ es app for the social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , divided a spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient large proportion of income , allowing Facebook to be the investment of such a stri@@ de as worthwhile . &quot;
on Tuesday Facebook with that it would be an &quot; display device &quot; to update the people more control over them .
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that there would be a new filter worrying because it would also block content on the page that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the user , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem &quot; says a spokes@@ man on Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool , which is why we have focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , in order to lay more control in the hands of the people . &quot;
woman having suspected suicide on Swiss free@@ way
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witness to having a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday at a presum@@ able suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman placed in the dark &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; on the street and were taken by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Schwei@@ ine died at the age of 49 , which was covered by several vehicles , including a truck , who was going to kill myself . &quot;
it still died on site .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some are still not identified , the police said this as well as every witness to the incident , to report itself . &quot;
&quot; an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is an &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter shared the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gene@@ ve . &quot;
however it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a collision avoidable ?
&quot; this is something that the Pro@@ secutor must decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers will not be held accountable .
in each of the two cases - where a person ran in the dark on the highway - was decided that drivers will not assume that a pedest@@ rians were running in the middle of the night on the highway as it was mentioned in the newspaper .
&quot; last year she was acqu@@ itted a poli@@ cem@@ an of neg@@ ligent killing , after having killed a man and killed in August 2014 a night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old sacrifice had drunk , and has been unconscious at the street , and took the dish . &quot;
the court noted that the poli@@ cem@@ an -- who had responded to a not@@ orious way -- came to a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the road was an &apos; completely exceptional and unfor@@ es@@ een situation &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges should report to the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 44 .
NASA climate A@@ amo@@ del : Venus was once occupied
Venus was probably once inhab@@ itable according to the projections of a new NASA climate models .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that are similar to those of climate scientists .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have encountered similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere . &quot;
scientists have previously declared that the slow upheav@@ al of the Venus could be explained by its tight atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation points out that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ gy atmosphere and still slowly revol@@ ved . &quot;
the model lit also the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably referred to more dry regions than the earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and faster delay . &quot;
the early Venus benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent of matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the long @-@ turn of Venus declared its daily side of the Sun almost two months , &quot; &quot; G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io stated in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which affects the surface of a large part of the sun &apos;s heat . &quot;
the result are average temperatures that some degree cooler than that of the earth today are .
&quot; the model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles the evolution , which previously was suspected by planet@@ arium . &quot;
although she was probably probably inhab@@ itable it was Venus -- in the course of several billions years and exposed to much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
her Oce@@ ans ev@@ apor@@ ates and their water vap@@ or was burned down by the ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen there remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that knows how to do it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate models in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy coming back as a coach of the Aval@@ an@@ che
&quot; Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado , and led to a low co @-@ determination process of the team . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will seek immediately after a new coach . &quot;
&quot; over the last three years , I have met my duties as chief trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determin@@ at@@ eness , &quot; &quot; the 50 @-@ year Roy vo@@ iced in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve been thinking about a long time during the summer and how I could improve this team to give him more depth , it needs and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the Vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a con@@ fu@@ tile right of decisions , which influence the performance of the team . &quot;
these conditions are not currently fulfilled .
&quot; sac@@ ic , which Roy had studied on 23 May 2013 , than@@ ked him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; said San@@ ic . &quot;
we all appreciate what he did for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy was awarded the Best Trainer of the League during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ che 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
&quot; he conducted the association on 112 points and in the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was struck up in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed in each of the last few years the season . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded in the 2015 @-@ 16 a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference at five points .
as Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart Roy has won four Stanley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
nor@@ des@@ ee@@ e@@ workers take talks in talks and put strike out
&quot; the workers with regard to the rem@@ uner@@ ation of North @-@ oil workers will be exposed , while all the dispute parties set up for a new conversation at the table , negoti@@ ators said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group have been run spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea that is run by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and r@@ ushes unions can confirm that we have agreed to re@@ generate the wick@@ edness of the current quar@@ rels , &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot;
&quot; we will keep some day @-@ day meetings in the coming weeks , starting at the beginning of next year to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; the trade unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , a protest against possible pay@@ roll of up to 30 percent . &quot;
this year the R@@ ates attributed to its contrasts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the management of the company follows a 10 @-@ process decline for on@@ shore contrac@@ tor in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company gives the required space to come through the market swing .
&quot; Shell has been released for its part thousands of people and to give up plans to give up his oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it provides its business activities as a result of its meg@@ at@@ re@@ unification with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; due to the lower costs of energy prices , there are under pressure , an economic situation which was reinforced by the decision of the British in June , the European Union . &quot;
the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met this week at the beginning of this week with workers &quot; leaders to discuss one of the greatest work strikes that have taken place since a generation in the North Sea .
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy , which works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; 2016 will be less than $ 1.4 billion in spending for new projects in the North Sea , compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures red @-@ rate of stars in the star @-@ pile of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler puppy tel@@ escope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation @-@ rates under the stars of the observ@@ atory of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades .
&quot; the new data will help astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the observ@@ atory can rot@@ ate different rates , as well as in what regard to the rotation @-@ time zones with the planetary formation process . &quot;
&quot; we hope that through the compar@@ ing of our results with other observ@@ atory , know more about the relationship between the mass of a star , age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infra@@ Red Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star @-@ dog of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light@@ years from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this star @-@ pile , which originated about 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ thood . &quot;
you now turn on the fastest .
&quot; to peak rates , these po@@ ignant stars encounter large amounts of star@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; since these winds travel through the magnet @-@ fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star age , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation @-@ rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a disc@@ er@@ ni@@ ble base -- such as sun@@ spots .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates points out that massive stars revol@@ ves slower than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ts as smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; ballet &quot; of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , while against quicker rot@@ ors , tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; as the observ@@ atory of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades are so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rotation rates . &quot;
&quot; the observ@@ atory of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and elderly , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is still a lot ahead of us that we would like to learn more about how the How , W@@ ann and Why stars slow@@ down their rotation rates and so to speak out their &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the Rot@@ ation rates of Pl@@ ei@@ ades that will soon be published in astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star appears from
the tears ran with Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to base .
&quot; after his emotional return notice , the 41 year old pro will carry on August 12 against the Tamp@@ a Bay R@@ ays a last time the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; I love this game , and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; Good@@ bye &apos;s &quot; , &quot; stated the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game participants of the Major League Baseball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable player of the League , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series . &quot;
his signature under a t@@ enth@@ ron@@ age of the year has received 27 million US dollars a year since 2007 .
&quot; by the end of the contrac@@ tor on 31 December 2017 , he will be able to serve as a consultant and a youth coach . &quot;
as a player there paid a long time with achievement for a long time .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his team ( &quot; &quot; R@@ us &quot; &quot; ) for the Seattle nav@@ ers ( 2001 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed some milestones . &quot;
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays show two more bas@@ eball player in the most important statistics similar values .
&quot; however , to the rest of the bas@@ eball of the bas@@ eball , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be absorbed . &quot;
&quot; for so successful Rodri@@ guez - nickname &quot; &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; &quot; - in the field was so controversial is his appearance outside the place . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 the super@@ star was taken at &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was locked up for 211 games due to a processing in the so @-@ called bio@@ energy @-@ sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ guez is considered the main double , for years to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida for many years . &quot;
after a dispute the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; the league could even have done a favour for the year 2014 , because I have played 20 years without a break , &quot; Rodri@@ guez said at that time . &quot;
&quot; also , his departure @-@ days did not go no@@ is@@ eless . &quot;
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends get into their last games once again the great stage , Rodri@@ guez had to sit frequently on the bank . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; &quot; Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married to the actress Cameron Di@@ az , and told the relationship with Pop@@ star Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson , sympathy @-@ def@@ endant of fans of Yan@@ kee Arch@@ riv@@ als Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; sang the followers at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ guez team . &quot;
&quot; Olympia 2016 : Chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing &quot;
&quot; know , because of a positive dop@@ ing sample , wei@@ ght@@ the@@ ber can not start from Poland in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed by the first official Dop@@ ing@@ es .
a sha@@ ky t@@ ine would have gained almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh race of the seventh day , the first official Dop@@ ing@@ ern@@ els were announced the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Chen X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter barriers from Bulgaria and the Polish weights Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested positive in Brazil - immediately prior to the beginning of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions these messages come to the time . &quot;
&quot; in Chen the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de had been proven last Sunday , used as a masculine remedy for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
the International Sport@@ geri@@ chtshof CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butterfly - just around 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday Chen Chen would have to participate in the lecture about 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
Chen has requested the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing .
&quot; the national association take the matter &quot; &quot; very serious and requires Chen in cooperation with the investigations , &quot; commented X@@ in@@ hua , from a Communication : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ geri@@ chtshof under CAS and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CAS for the modernis@@ ing of athletes with positive cases is responsible . &quot;
also in the night of Rio oo@@ zing the news about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa by the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; this was an unbelievable shock , &quot; &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it is inno@@ cent , &quot; the only explanation might be dietary supplements , &quot; explained the Athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is intended to act with the banned substance around the blood @-@ offering of EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; for the time , Dan@@ ek@@ owa has been suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample is supposed to have a positive effect . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Boy@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov mel@@ ted immediately with criticism of the athlete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; thus , approximately all the weights are allowed to participate in the chron@@ ically @-@ offering @-@ loaded nation in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski , &quot; was also known as the London Olymp@@ ics in the class up to 85 kg as his brother tom@@ as@@ z tested three days before a positive response to the An@@ ab@@ ole Ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both are able to capture the intake , but they are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
before the start of the athle@@ tics especially the case Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another heavy blow for the reputation of the entire sport .
&quot; the World association IA@@ AF was banned from the entire Russian team to the exception due to systematic Dop@@ ings , also the L@@ Ã¤u@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produced in Rio numerous bad news . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming sport , the former associations in China also had taken care of fierce disputes between the athletes . &quot;
so the Fren@@ chman Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympi@@ ad Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium more than 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to pass , &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot;
sun was at the heart of a debate with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ ammers , &quot; &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; sun had been positive for the Chinese champi@@ on@@ ships in the case of the stimul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to sit on a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ ma@@ ges h@@ ackers her ran@@ som
programmers of Er@@ press@@ ungs @-@ Malware to target currently targeted companies - and are successful in this process .
&quot; according to a recent survey of the malware @-@ defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes under 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany were 40 percent of surve@@ yed companies in the past twelve months at least once , partly several victims of a attack with black@@ mail@@ ers . &quot;
in Germany nearly 20 percent of companies have already been the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims paid by the perpetrators requested by the perpetrators requested to be able to use the requested systems and data .
the perpetrators speci@@ alis@@ es their black@@ mail@@ ings according to the observations of mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attacks in company networks .
&quot; they are successful there , the potentially push @-@ money is significantly higher than in private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a start@@ ling fast evolution of the damage software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to transmit advertising . &quot;
then we discovered the perpetrators of black@@ ma@@ iling software for itself .
&quot; unfortunately , private users were the goal , but the change to company attacks was horri@@ fying quickly in the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware is working according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of an offering , it searches for un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ ts the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
subsequently the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail@@ ers .
&quot; in order to get the end @-@ turn code to the files , the victims need money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ ge@@ bit@@ coin - over@@ point . &quot;
&quot; however , where in private users the personal photo database is on the game , it is related to sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is imp@@ acted . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage is caused when a ran@@ som@@ ware suggests . &quot;
&quot; 22 per cent of the German firms affected by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had even forced to break the business operations , in a case people were in danger . &quot;
&quot; in Germany several hospitals are victims of attacks , whose patients may be threatened by the loss of nursing women . &quot;
&quot; we say to the victims always : do not pay , you only support the problem , &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 per cent of the companies that pay their dates back . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetr@@ ator in view of stand@@ still . &quot;
the h@@ ackers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
in a current study the security researchers of F @-@ Secure expl@@ ores the pay@@ ers and contact with black@@ mail@@ ings and come to the result : the perpetrators will actually try to build up a kind of customer service in order to take more money .
&quot; they explain their sacrifice by chat , as they can pay by bit@@ coin , direct accessible support @-@ sites or de@@ code for free example files . &quot;
&quot; and people are redeemed on payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate hard and pay five dig@@ it sums in order to get their data un@@ de@@ cryp@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the Ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ackers are becoming more and more professional and share the work , explaining security experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski by the anti @-@ virus vendors Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is probable that three or four people are concerned . &quot;
the programmers sell their poll@@ ut@@ ants then in the form of a software neu@@ tered to the actual black@@ mail@@ ers .
&quot; the previous Malware to kits were created by the Malware to themselves , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; it is included in the scope of delivery , so that smaller configur@@ ations can be changed , look and bran@@ ding , &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ mail@@ ers are then looking for further h@@ ackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so you log into one of the forums in the underground , the set of a criminals and instruc@@ ts another so to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
the payment is made per in@@ activated calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually , the criminals then take sp@@ ammers with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that secure their data better .
over 50 percent of companies @-@ IT entities in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust that Ran@@ som@@ ware can be dra@@ gged off using file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ anners software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful testing , the perpetr@@ ator instead associated with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; with this , the potential for damages depending on the type of data is much higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpetrators will also be able to fully take new targets on the internet of things in the future . &quot;
the security researchers demonstrated in the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrating security researchers as they were able to get under their control using the Internet .
&quot; in the middle of winter , the activation of such a block@@ aded heating is thus worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ator then instead of heating in the future block a whole production road in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a subject in industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday use
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V it wants to pack everything : a little SU@@ V , a little coup@@ Ã© , and also the versatility of a mini@@ vans . &quot;
&quot; it sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be very flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V seems rather small , passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the F@@ ond . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ top is falling out there . &quot;
versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V into the storage room .
&quot; there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l available at highly @-@ issued and 10@@ 26 l by fenced back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the sitting areas of the back@@ bank can be sli@@ pped like Kin@@ os@@ es@@ sel and thus offer storage space , which is up from the floor up to the ceilings 1.@@ 24 m . &quot;
&quot; the boot @-@ room can be easily loaded , but the charging level with 650 mm is a little higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1,6 @-@ l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide torque areas very powerful .
but he is likely to do his job somewhat qui@@ eter .
enjoyable is the everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km .
there is still another mot@@ orization : a 1.5 @-@ l @-@ pet@@ rol engine with 96 kW / 130 HP .
a all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the rider is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
the steering is likely to be a bit more direct .
the equipment can be opened in the tested top @-@ variant &quot; Executive &quot; no wishes .
&quot; security systems is part of the City @-@ Not@@ bre@@ ms@@ ass@@ istent ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision system and the trace heating system . &quot;
&quot; the coll@@ isions are sometimes irrit@@ ated , because he evaluated many obstacles as &quot; &quot; ann@@ u@@ tive objects &quot; . &quot; &quot;
very reliable works by the tel@@ escope .
and the intelligent tem@@ p respon@@ ds to the road detection and d@@ ros@@ sel@@ t when needed the speed .
&quot; but full connectivity is only available for the top facilities : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App Integration and More . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI @-@ jack are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat awkward to achieve .
the around 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel is ok . &quot;
&quot; who will not invest so much , he will receive the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , diesel from 23@@ ,000 Euros . &quot;
the engines meet the Euro @-@ 6 @-@ exhaust .
with the HR @-@ V offers Honda a versatile and everyday @-@ going car .
Air@@ line is not liable : down@@ fall on Air@@ craft
an airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the flight bridge .
&quot; for a liability is only conceivable among the dangers that are typical for air traffic , the Ober@@ land Court is argued ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had broken down a bru@@ te force .
&quot; however , the accident could have occurred everywhere - it is a common risk of life , so the court . &quot;
the airline had no damage to the man .
disease cases : when paid by the Organ@@ izer
&quot; patients will only get money back after their journey , if the cause of the disease is undoubtedly visible in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests experience the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the hardened case , a family on the second day of their Turkish is difficult to diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
it spent nearly the whole holiday in the room .
&quot; your illness brought back the holi@@ day@@ makers on a def@@ ective K@@ lÃ¤@@ s system , which had supposedly contaminated the sea@@ water . &quot;
the family was the view the trip had been fla@@ wed with that - and compl@@ ained against the organizer .
at the court the pl@@ ain@@ ant had no success .
&quot; though , the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ lage was indeed def@@ ective . &quot;
but the organizer learned only shortly before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; thus , he did not viol@@ ate his information , so the judgment . &quot;
&quot; especially , especially since the samples of water have not been de@@ contam@@ in@@ ants . &quot;
the disease of several hotel guests - bl@@ ur@@ ly by infection with each other - belonging to the general risk of life .
from 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were reduced .
&quot; said de Ma@@ izi@@ Ã¨re , after the violence perpetr@@ ated by refugees in WÃ¼rzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have concerns about further attacks . &quot;
the state must be fool@@ ed and decided at the same time to counter terrorism .
sure : our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ator with hate and spl@@ itting .
this triumph we will not treat the terrorists .
&quot; if criminals would have to leave the country faster , but the security and strength of the population is also responsible for the refugee policy . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ Ã¨re wants to implement the proposals up to the Bundestag election in 2017 .
&quot; he also announced another person@@ alization of the security forces , namely &quot; &quot; in middle @-@ four @-@ scale production &quot; &quot; over several years . &quot;
sympath@@ izing for terrorism must be back under punishment .
&quot; video surveillance should be improved , the fire@@ arms is to be manipul@@ ated so that especially the purchase of weapons on the internet is made . &quot;
the last much discussed welding of doctors should stick to de Ma@@ izi@@ Ã¨res words .
&quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the sleeves juice , such as the haz@@ ard of citizens , he said with a view of psych@@ ic abnormalities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act as a radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister keeps a better social care necessary . &quot;
teachers should better be prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ sed people .
&quot; to the persecution of criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ Ã¨re is planning to use investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD leader Gabriel said , &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to security . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of Interior was clearly spoken against shareholders .
&quot; this was an ear for the sni@@ ff@@ makers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , Gabriel told the newspapers of the group of Medi@@ ation ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ Ã¨re was rejected by the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double nationality previously rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a generic pro@@ hibition of full@@ ness , he is constitu@@ tionally problematic for constitu@@ tionally . &quot;
&quot; it is not possible to offer everything you are ref@@ uted , and I dis@@ agree the bur@@ ing of the bur@@ ah . &quot;
you can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses in court .
green @-@ Che@@ fin Simone Peter threw the minister before he wants to simul@@ ate new anti @-@ terror par@@ c@@ els and action capacity .
&quot; leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said , &quot; &quot; Fle@@ et Fle@@ et and an ag@@ grav@@ ating of the right to the right brings people no more security in this country . &quot;
better traffic @-@ flow on the motorway exit
it st@@ ats regularly on the road @-@ road - here is a picture of November .
&quot; however , that should change : the law@@ ns should be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is good news for all the motor@@ cyclists who travel in professional traffic on the road road every night , when they travel across the highway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; the road station is extended on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Street and the departure of Wes@@ eler Street at 700 meters . &quot;
drivers can then turn right from the hammer road to the right .
&quot; the great advantage : the traffic is divided in premature ejaculation , giving the overall financial stability on the frequ@@ ented section of the federal road 51 will be improved . &quot;
the idea of the prolonged exit had the CD@@ U @-@ Group in the districts of representing MÃ¼nster @-@ West .
the train station on the Zu@@ br@@ inger nervous the motor@@ ists especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; week@@ days , the return reaches back to the bridge over the Alber@@ lie trail , and sometimes also beyond . &quot;
&quot; reason , the needle &apos;s needle is on the B 51 shortly before the departure of Wes@@ eler StraÃe . &quot;
&quot; from here , traffic only goes down to the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be rep@@ lic@@ ated in three years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had revealed that the bridge has no more the required load capacity , in order to accommodate above all the heavy @-@ time traffic . &quot;
&quot; how long this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the connected daily St@@ au is going to last , the local business can not be said . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to calculate : for the bridge has an official remain@@ der of up to 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal ground , the local operation has chosen the busi@@ est time in the school holidays , because with disabilities to be reck@@ oned . &quot;
the traffic is passed on Tuesday and Wednesday at the building site .
intercultural travel : cultural offers for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the play &quot; The Inv@@ isible House . &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre now plan a music project .
the Association of N@@ ima &apos;s supports young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in MÃ¼nster .
the &quot; class International &quot; of Wald@@ schule Child &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The Inv@@ isible House &quot; of the Young Theatre of MÃ¼nster .
in the context of the association N@@ ima &apos;s initi@@ ated &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; 19 students between eleven and 15 years has visited the st@@ aging in the small house .
&quot; since the beginning of the year the association , which has set itself the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugees to visit schools with welcome classes , as part of this project of cultural institutions in MÃ¼nster . &quot;
&quot; most young people in the class are between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to MÃ¼nster , and has little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video anim@@ ations it has been possible to follow the action for action , so the press release of the boy The@@ aters MÃ¼nster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wester@@ berg from Spra@@ g@@ ust , and the Young Theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a musical the@@ ater@@ project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December young people are to be able to get young people with and without escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years , professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
special offers for children and families in the field of theatre and theatri@@ cal language courses are included in the planning .
the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
&quot; in the face of the Asc@@ ended Refu@@ ge@@ e , the association expects a lot of classes that want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of star@@ lets : hope of we@@ ather@@ ings
&quot; the weather has made the observ@@ ance @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ers in the south @-@ west of Germany on the night to Friday a line through the bill , but there is still hope . &quot;
&quot; the night was bad because of clouds and rain , the sky @-@ spectacle to observe , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we surely see many star@@ gates in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the constell@@ ations are per@@ sil@@ ky , that includes 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour to the fastest constell@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; they have their names , because they apparently come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for in@@ som@@ nia
&quot; in the evening you have been working forever , at night it is ho@@ ur@@ ly awake , in the morning there is no more to think of sleep in the morning before the wake @-@ up . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adult sleep disorders , and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently rest@@ ful . &quot;
how do sleep problems or in@@ som@@ nia ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there are many causes due to them , Hans @-@ GÃ¼nter We@@ pour , board member of the German Society for Schla@@ ge@@ ty and Sle@@ eping Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what you understand them , is however the in@@ som@@ nia , so a single and sleep @-@ compul@@ sive disorder . &quot;
&quot; in fact , many people feel as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ ingen , member of the member of the German Hou@@ se@@ wage association with practice in the Lower Sax@@ on Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind in@@ som@@ nia ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; behind it , organic , mental or conditional factors , but also medicines are stuck . &quot;
not rare is the sleep @-@ disorder expression of any other disorder .
&quot; very early waking up is mainly in case of depression , &quot; says We@@ pour . &quot;
and it can be that several factors would like each other .
&quot; for instance , who for instance has a band@@ ry case , can be bad , wake up all the two to three hours and begin to salute you about all day issues and to p@@ onder@@ ing , we@@ ave an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when to talk to health care doctor ?
those who are not asleep over a month of a month at least three nights per week and is not affected by the day should go to the doctor .
&quot; impairment can look completely different : it is slo@@ ping , tired , un@@ exhausted , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood fluctu@@ ations or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches . &quot;
&quot; to allevi@@ ate the sleep , it is important to figure out their causes . &quot;
&quot; as treatment options , such as treatment options , a cognitive behavi@@ oral therapy , or even medicines - classical sleeping tablets are only in the exception and at the most no more for two weeks - question . &quot;
&quot; it is hardly stressed in Germany , Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the interdisciplinary and Medical Center of the Char@@ itÃ© UniversitÃ¤ts@@ medizin Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one should first contact the veterinary surgeon in the case of sleep problems . &quot;
it can clarify with investigations if the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should go to sleep , and what happens ? &quot;
&quot; for exam@@ ining in the sleeping laboratory medical care is for example with snor@@ ing with respir@@ ation , in disease @-@ suffering , or if you do not find the cause of a sle@@ epy disorder , be@@ ating spru@@ ce . &quot;

what the junk camp with missing medals in swimming to has
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook to dis@@ appoint the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he held gold for the first time in Doha for the first time and presented his first world record at the same time . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has placed himself in the cri@@ tiques in front of his ex @-@ team @-@ mates . &quot;
&quot; in a country where an Olymp@@ ics received 20,000 â¬ pre@@ mie and a junk . 150@@ ,000 â¬ no one should be wondering about missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on the night to Friday on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the conve@@ ying system in swimming @-@ sport is bad , the dop@@ ing@@ controls however very good . &quot;
&quot; we cannot compete with countries that have a lot to promote and do not look at the subject of dop@@ ing , or do it even with the subject of dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; I do not say that here the controls are to be set , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler would have to be reported already nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how you should hold it with countries too .

airport : gang of Car@@ rier and Car@@ de@@ tain
professional th@@ iev@@ es at the airport DÃ¼sseldorf
civilians were born on Thursday the arrest of two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 years .
the tat@@ too had been committed as a gang of many pick@@ pockets and pieces of luggage .
at 21.@@ 30 am civil servants realized in the area of the airport DÃ¼sseldorf a gang that was known to the poli@@ cem@@ an from past theft .
the two women and two men had committed several Deli@@ vered since mid @-@ July and were generally shared and particularly professional .
&quot; the specialists of the crime com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ate 34 may have traveled the di@@ eting , who had travelled to Germany &apos;s accus@@ ation to Germany , four acts . &quot;
&quot; in the process , they had a total of more than 15@@ ,000 Euro . &quot;
&quot; Alt@@ built , a few Lin@@ den@@ ds , a few lime pl@@ ump , meanwhile , the Rig@@ a@@ er StraÃe in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in appears at first glance , but the police ranks them among the &quot; &quot; dangerous places &quot; &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; passing the road from east to west , one goes by playing , a refresh@@ ed kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ aden . &quot;
at the facade of a gray house someone has &quot; ugly ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
&quot; opposite to a Li@@ dl , which is also soon to be demol@@ ished , is already built : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new apartments . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; trendy part &quot; , &quot; as the competent property company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in calls , however , are preferred to be illustrated with burning cars in the past few weeks . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the inhabitants have rented s@@ lugg@@ ish , but on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the Berlin interior has been repeatedly called &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers , the police had three weeks of official statements , according to 30 to 40 officials and three teams on the spot , un@@ ned parts of the road and kept visitors from entering the house with the number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners are the spaces . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin administrative course decided that the clear@@ ance was illegal , and one day later police and construction workers moved under the rejo@@ icing of sympath@@ isers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon , the street peace@@ full : parents go for walking with kids , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking about Sp@@ Ã¤t@@ i . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the building projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
&quot; lef@@ tist force is not the main care of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in the jaw since 1999 , and J@@ ana * that runs here three children mainly from the police presence . &quot;
with the inhabitants of the building projects they share the care of rising tenants and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sounds like a p@@ Ã¡@@ z who wanted to have a majority more sensitive political protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ zing left .
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin interior and the police have opened between domestic and their neighbours , does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the East Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class district , which also has a low average age in comparison to the rest of the city and has a high degree of poverty . &quot;
&quot; domestic activities and the resulting living projects have long been occupied by the Kie@@ z : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Mainz street very close to the Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer was cleared under a large police force in a down@@ right street , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and partly occupied by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the quarter in recent years has become increasingly becoming the magne@@ ts for tourists and election lin@@ ers from all over the world : they now share their native inhabitants from the GDR @-@ times and former house @-@ possessed . &quot;
this is also visible in the tenants which have increased almost 60 percent since 2009 .
&quot; many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one recogni@@ zes them in rec@@ ted sli@@ ces or newly @-@ covered fac@@ ades , which were ej@@ ected with colour@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; no other street was mentioned so often together with the words &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one reason for that not all neighbors can be seen as a problem , may be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime : crimes like body immunity , are almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the largest part of the crimes make it sh@@ ame@@ ful , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rent in a rent next to the controversial 94 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as for violence , it is important : people in the 94 are their neighbors , which were not intended . &quot;
even the famous burning cars will give it right in the Rig@@ a@@ er no longer .
&quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focus on the contrary : &quot; here you help each other , live together on the road and get more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been deliberately drawn into the Riga Street and stayed there .
&quot; that &apos;s why it was so important for her to get back their road : from the police , the politics and the media , who in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the city . &quot;
&quot; yet in the eyes of Be@@ ans as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to take away from them : through secured new buildings in former buildings that push the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are ultimately con@@ domini@@ um , which are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so good at all , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction can I absolutely not have pro@@ fan@@ ed . &quot;
but what should we do if one never list@@ ens to someone ?
&quot; there is a frustration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding about colour bombs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the building projects and the left scene belonged to the jaw . &quot;
who draws who should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub that can be poorly compl@@ aining of noise .

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in matters of integration and organizer .
&quot; moreover , she is a social @-@ worker . &quot;
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le the refugee commissioned for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ ical supports the team of managing Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; it sees itself as a contact person for all actors : refugees , working class refugees , administration , authorities and who else is involved . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer from labour @-@ circle indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ ves Wol@@ l@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , who has above all a problem . &quot;
&quot; so , some - less spot@@ ting than on the multitude of conceptual areas were targeted , as the administration wanted to write the place . &quot;
&quot; searched for was a administration with a talent for languages and people , connected with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an experience of Wol@@ l@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; however , administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with local people and also behind the scenes and network activities . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent spot on three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le Ehr@@ ing and main actors . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organisational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
soon new containers stand in the W@@ as@@ enstraÃe
&quot; a serious problem has been to be found for some time , apartments for the ti@@ tan@@ cies which have been acknowledged . &quot;
&quot; for the mounting , the municipalities are responsible . &quot;
they have to accom@@ o@@ date refugees in their own or rented residential areas .
the cost of construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the Land@@ mark Office on the Commune and job center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search for some time has been very difficult .
de facto administration does not find private apartments .
&quot; so far it does not work so far , you should rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common homes must be respected as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers are placed in the W@@ as@@ enstraÃe .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , the Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed stay , there are tra@@ ine@@ eship , training courses , training courses , A @-@ euro jobs and subsidies for refugees and migrants , who have to be or established . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work at the Bau@@ hof or help to master the house@@ master , perform charitable work - and the motiv@@ ates and very neat , like Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
she hopes that the work of the community leads to a positive out@@ influence .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
&quot; the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a feeling of belonging .
&quot; so , there are offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
so also here administration and volunteers .
&quot; it is central that refugees get the feeling , they are welcome in Germany and welcome . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; you must explain the refugees that it takes and they can take the time meaningful , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who will eventually develop the feeling that he could not work in Ur@@ bach nobody , should not work and be un@@ sel@@ fish , who will never be integrated . &quot;
the clear majority was motivated .
&quot; however , the problem is honest , &quot; people honestly , &quot; people where nothing goes on . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
&quot; all that is already a &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do the two of the recent occur@@ ren@@ ces fear of radic@@ alisation , even in a small village like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; what some might be called na@@ Ã¯@@ ve na@@ Ã¯@@ ve &quot; . &quot; a resi@@ dual risk could and would not shut it out . &quot;
&quot; sensi@@ ti@@ zes , the hel@@ pers are already . &quot;
this incidents are also subject to refugees .
they would have the fear that the attacks bring them completely in re@@ vocation .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main - and volunteers do not have to go on site and in the region following activities .
&quot; in the background , they always found a new shock to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach . &quot;
does Germany need a cap ?
this question clearly describes how politics gets .
&quot; actually , it is unfair to put them on site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we are not there yet , where we would like to go , &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , this would be able to relax . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher have already been running smoothly , to integrate the existing people . &quot;
&quot; there are currently around 100 people , mostly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political situation is so complicated , there are no easy answers . &quot;
