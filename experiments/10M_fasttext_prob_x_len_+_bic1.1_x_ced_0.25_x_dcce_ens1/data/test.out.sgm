<seg id="11">"he sat down with his family on the grounds of the ALRV, on a horse swang it not even to photosets."</seg>
<seg id="12">This long was the first time in Aachen and therefore also with CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German Sporthilfe passed the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala the Golden Sportpyramide.</seg>
<seg id="15">"on awards, it lacks the likable athlete."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent trade agreement TTP - that want to both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"unfortunately, the two US presidential competition were however at the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"differences in the economic policy of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton lies a fundamental, more philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small in doubt and warned about how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton thanked the economy to death and regulate death, he says. "</seg>
<seg id="8">"on the other hand, he himself would be quite different, says Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively back regulators, and it makes strong tax reform with lower control units strong - for private people and for businesses."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, Clinton says: the state has certain duties to open, he has disadvantaged opportunities to open and need money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes for the rich would increase, says it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in fact, Trump and Clinton say almost wore."</seg>
<seg id="14">The Democratic candidate certainly announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs into the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are refused by the state-critical Teaparty-wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"therefore, on Trump there could be a non-partisan discussion."</seg>
<seg id="17">Evident are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal power plants and rebuild the coal mining operation in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil-mining should also be possible in so far protected areas to announce the Paris mitigation agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"on the other hand, Clinton wants to expand and demands the renewable energy programme with its investment program:" a country will create the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only with infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not far away from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"tPP, the transpazionfish trade agreement, do not want to sign both."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both do not want to isolate the U.S. from international trade - but simply to protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the should then also be paid better then, for about Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump is going to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must, then he says, he should not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to become more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump stands for the economy and the citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics keep him in front of him, that the budget deficit would only be greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least ask from the rich, that they pay more taxes and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="2">"sexual violence belongs to women, who alone escape, almost already for everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen sitting four women.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby with me at most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has placed her little son in the arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He wakes with big eyes curious in the room.</seg>

<seg id="10">Until they noticed that it is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles short and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene works normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you speak to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is the Executive Officer of Condrobs, a carrier of social aid agencies in Bavaria, and deals with the topic of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich north in one of the few decentralised accommodations for all women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs has made up the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich's Aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">"recently, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men do not exist - also not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard at the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: any woman who arrives here has made her flight experience with sexual violence," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men will flee for wars because they are politically persecuted, because they send torture or death because their families send them to Europe as a hope for hope."</seg>
<seg id="24">Women overweigh other reasons for escape: "many are secretly aware of it because they do not see any other way out.</seg>
<seg id="25">"they have experience in their home country with sexual violence, compulsion, honorary, slavery or coerprostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This is what drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run it goes further.</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tugs call for example for a bottle of water a sexual act is no rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone; they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end as soon as they ankle in Germany, irre, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"also here, women in refugee camps were often seen as inferior and worse."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to that about 90 percent of women who live in the residence in the Munich north, traumatized them."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntarily created." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women were so accustomed to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to talk openly about the experiences, because the shame is too great."</seg>
<seg id="36">"because they often fail to help him, no more accommodations need only for them, calls Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven districts governing plants are in charge of the accommodation of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"to the question whether they knew from a similar project like in Munich in its jurisdiction, some are responding to no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Oberpfalz region and Oberfranken, there is no such thing in accommodations of the governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"even in Schwaben alone, women were not separated alone, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, Presseson the Government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Oberbayern, Lower and Mittelfranken there are some floors of floors, or own houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Dutbayern, there are two central accommodations for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">Also the committee "rights of the women and gender equality" committee in the European Parliament is calling for women to be separated from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study that was published for the Committee, says:" it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"lacks the privacy or become women and women together, it can lead to - perpetual violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">Especially the washing rooms should be separated and accessible to women in the study.</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women feel this protected area, one can read by the rush that there is to the house in Munich."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance between outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended up a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce the hands and proclaim an official end to the eight months of continued war, and economic sanctions."</seg>

<seg id="8">I could no longer count.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even better to improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day was a newspaper that Erdogan had heard so bengan as if never had any worst happen.</seg>
<seg id="11">I seemed to see his enthusiasm more on the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin beaming, sustainable chastile showed that the president of Russia had nothing to forget."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductions: the downing of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border with Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was wutated.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin divided and accused Ankara to please Russia into the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The failure was even bigger since it was done by a alleged friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The pulses will rebuild again if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"months long, the nationally controlled media led a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">At once it seemed that the Turks would blame for all the debts.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the serious officials were the allegations of guiding officials that Erdogan had benefited their family from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from the President Erdogan who he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to win a sort of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are clearly on hand."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Erdogan mainly requires all the friends who can get, after spending last month in a failed coup d almost his Amtes."</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attacks on Turkey also shaken him shaken.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - particularly the prohibition of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is decreased by nearly 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">Travel agencies and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are being resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They are counting on a belated onslaught on the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week predicted the TV expelled, cheap fruits and vegetables, as soon as the Turkish agrarian imported once again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formulate it as follows:" tourists there long, tomatoes here long. "</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an extra political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious to the West since it has been seen as a weak answer to the tried.</seg>
<seg id="38">"to do this, the ongoing grudge through the snow empowerment of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the erpike is to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"at Ankara, Russian state leader won a bonus for ensuring that he tried to seek support for the elected state organs."</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well-evident for Moscow. self-evident that itself has a profound fear of regiments itself.</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this glorious palace made it possible for Russia and Turkey, one as described to me an analysts once described," "Alliance of outsiders" ": two countries that feel embarrassed from the West and are poorly treated."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, in spite of the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey are opposed to opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be indicative that after nearly three hours of first talks, both presidents at the press conference said that they could not even striped on the subject."</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey gued it intentionally to answer a question about their differences while Putin decided to emphasize this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found to Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect discaster, as NATO member Turkey took off the Russian combat jet - it certainly is better that the two leaders at least once again talk."</seg>

<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"as Putin, he came to power he called Ivanov as one of five people, whom he was familiar with the most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once, Ivanov went to Putin's second term president of Russia as a third term Putin's coup would have rejected the constitution."</seg>

<seg id="2">"" "the SPD and Greens mean: investors should be much stronger in the future."</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 favorable apartments in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="4">"the SPD is proposing a" "action concept" "to the next council session."</seg>
<seg id="5">But argument is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost it is about the question: who is supposed to build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation has been lacking.</seg>
<seg id="8">"SPD leader Christoph Bratmann writes:" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas in the future, it must show 20 percent of all the apartments as a social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments are also available in the continuance."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but the large part of the town hall is, as Bratunmann:" "how do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to make at least 10 per cent, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments build as social housing as much as possible."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new municipal housing construction programme, which will cost millions of costs and is still to be financed by incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, as Bratunmann:" "there is still no agreement between the Groups." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors possible as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left still wants to be hardness of investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"regardless, as Bratunmann, a tightening of the situation is on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the action concept is implemented, which will provide for additional tasks in the building administration."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the program does not yet exist: for the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how does one balances the loss of other around 1300 cheap apartments, which will end up in the coming years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"only by 2020, there will be 500 apartments alone."</seg>
<seg id="23">"to prevent this, so the planatory spokeswoman Nicole Palm, should now be bought out-out ties of the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought to bring apartments back to the price."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western town.</seg>
<seg id="26">Put on a blow to solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the western town the end of the year is walking.</seg>
<seg id="28">Approximately 1800 apartments you could get there back to the price of cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: they do not want the owners to housing housing companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing in the west city increases dramatically, one gets away from the goal of the so-called mixture."</seg>
<seg id="31">A concentration of social weak in just a few parts of the city shall not be able to give it any more.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect that there is still movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"group leader Holger Herlitschke thinks:" "for a vast majority the CDU needs to go into the boat."</seg>

<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially limited to the television, then video games and last on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">"therefore, it is great to see that technology and activities are not mutually exclusive."</seg>
<seg id="7">"naturally I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app, based on the characters, first created for videogames in the 1990ies (later the drawing series arose, game cards and other spin-off)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as many phenomena of pop culture, the interest in the release of the game in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand have something in the beginning of July."</seg>
<seg id="9">The launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the server was lawed.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>

<seg id="17">"many public education campaigns for health, people want to take" "take 30 minutes of time", "" "coming from the sofa" "and" "to be active every day, because many public messages are getting boring and come from people coming."</seg>

<seg id="19">"who regularly drives sports, reduces its chances to suffer from cancer or depression."</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits, which is too long to guide them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the wonderfull amount of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open, making them fun."</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close the hunt even new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there is also mürgous gameplay, who always have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could run against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has been a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if smartphone apps have already been able to follow our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to exercise sports as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will be replicated with time.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveler underwent his immune system and Würgereflex a serious test - by changing some of the dirtiest and liveliest places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the presenter and Traveler, Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk slipped his course on a Euro-cord, a banker in the Piccadilly Circus, a purse of a tractor fan, as well as a public telephone in Russia in order to prove the resistance of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before the death of every object, he used a detonometer to show up and to show us what it will be introduced."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results to daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought, the purbone of a tractor fan, has been used already by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact they are more bad bacteria."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with physicians and medical professionals on the promotion of bowel bacteria, as well as his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately nothing left, what he deceased, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr. Wright has been known to test the resistance of his intestine, by travelling through the world and ate unique as well as wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public funds to train stations to purge stations from toilets, the task set his immune system definitely under a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he told:" already as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was able to do justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its prostrate showed a Luminometer-speed of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison to this amounts the Luminometer-speeds are less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to soak after their Lumindometer speed over 4000 units was, while fresh-washed hands have a lot less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products valio produced the travel program" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the bacterial number in different places like the bathroom"</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," This is coming to the worst which I have in a toilet, near. "</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">"I will do nothing here, because it is ecstatic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company hosted Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which includes both Lactobacilli and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we really wanted to offer the consumer something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look and at the same time explained the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"we led crazy Brainstormings by making sure that we said" "Lass us Ian." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of only talking about products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the meaning of the intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I also think, that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!"</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the film directed by the film, added:" let me have lost it so - I had lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I have given to him, just like the disgusting Russian toilet that will be shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course there were things in which it was easier to put Ian, to watch them and others where this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I am glad we recorded some of these dirty treats available on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by 2015, 84 percent of all respondents in the survey conducted in particular with the wellness of stomach and intestine and 58 percent said that they may at least occasionally use products that included lactobacillus."</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: locals get nothing from the summer campaign against - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia must not choose the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they have understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"2021 will not take place right at the end of summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"for just as so far, it is not: summer holidays, heat and land-day struggle - that bites."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the locals, who are to be convinced by the constituencies, are on vacation."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most of the tourists who are in the country are on the way to Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the country's day."</seg>
<seg id="8">"there are practical problems: in the holidays are helpers, disperse posters, balloons, flyers, flyers and at the end of the vote are only tired."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until 4 September 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern needs to go over again by the people from Mecklenburg-Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="10">"hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his position."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, since 1998 strongest party, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys."</seg>
<seg id="13">"it will be exciting, how strong newcomer AfD cuts, and what remains at the end of the coalition."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 governing board, makes an almost inconspicuous electoral campaign, one sees from his major posters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels through the land, spread roses and chatting a little with the people, as it already has his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, Seelering cold feet have given and chancellor Merkel the blame for the flourishing of AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"their refugee policy, you" We create "" did the rise of right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful position now. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU with its leading candidacy, the Minister of Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced the way it is when you make the wrong time at the right place for the time."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited twice the chancellor Angela Merkel: Merkel BundestagswahlDistrict is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the target group did not vote, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Saxony as Starenburger and Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was probably the majority of other federal states, said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR."</seg>
<seg id="22">But it is also a pity to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise the Northeast-CDU is largely relieved of the usual choices on market areas and above shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"so, Kokert, I just play a" "minor role". ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Union also noted that in the country you have the base, that it needs to be very strict, to find a drain to the people again."</seg>
<seg id="26">"as far as the left, the SPD, the Greens: in the land of the country hardly exists."</seg>
<seg id="27">"the Council of the CDU campaign of Kokert on his comrades is also self-revealing:" "they must go there where it hurts, namely where men are: Dorffeste, Goldene weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">"because much is standing on the game, Sellering his SPD has now called for a particularly committed campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in surveys, the Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind the CDU (25) and just below the AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in the election of 2011, the SPD had already made clear with 35.6 per cent before the CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Greens, small party with seven percent in the polls, should also create the leap into the country's day."</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the holiday need a modern virtue and put their constitutive campaigns in the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online campaigns," says the Governing Claudia Müller. "</seg>

<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising.</seg>

<seg id="17">"these will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU-man gives. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, he does not consider this to be reasonable, and I don't ask anything that has no chance with the coalitions."</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas are presented de Maizière as well.</seg>
<seg id="20">They are partly in themselves: he plans fast proceedings for deportations and more possibilities for the imprisonment of people before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">"refugees, which are targeted specifically to the country, should check their smart phones and open social media accounts for a security check."</seg>
<seg id="22">Dulture for expious asylum seekers wants to make some worse still worse than so far - such that crimes commit themselves or their paperers deliberately throw away their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of this is politically and legally married.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some also acts unbalanced and leaves questions openly.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with some points - in the unequal treatment of thought - the question arises: what does this actually have to do with certainty and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">"but it cannot be questioned, that the assassination of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees."</seg>
<seg id="28">"furthermore, many people were worried about the high level of refugees concerned about security."</seg>

<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">"and yes, there are electoral campaigns."</seg>

<seg id="36">In the last days we went up between the two parties.</seg>
<seg id="37">"only a garthpiece dispute over the equipment of the federal police, then on a security policy collection of some Unions Interior, in which the resists also demand a Burka ban and a return from the double citizenship."</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière mishes itself here for conciliatory sounds.</seg>

<seg id="40">We had the discussion in Germany satisfied.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination: who is buying it?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men medium-aged men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you have to rush to the comment, to reboot it under the pseudonym non-Allevials of the Middle Ages with rinsults, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the complex recovery of gramophone records do not want to welcome a boom in Millennials, who want to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but to Midlife-nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"those who recently bought a record recently, are all forecast according to the age between 45 and 54."</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older Plattling buyers keep their feelings more likely to spend (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on television, I would follow the camera while in the midst of a busy street in Soho, a humble gray suit carry and wild staceful before I keep standing, my hands hold and something dominating the way:" so, let us take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let us take a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"although the heart of Sohos is slowly hung on his charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent vendors were located - there still is a handful of ludicant business transactions."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and minds through observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I from Sister Ray (Datenet's number: two young women, three men middle ages) follow the Reckless Records (Datenrecount): eight men middle ages, one woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and walks through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, question I?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess already," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records."</seg>
<seg id="17">"this records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I am not followed by him), dress the walls of his home."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles, the result of its available income: it is now able to buy panels which he could not afford to buy stuff when he sold young and pleite."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70's, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things that I thought was probably a little too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy the plates, rather introverted and like to spend their own time, and adds:" I non-smoking, and I don't drink very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my push.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believe that many customers that he meets to meet the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the Medienhpe, people who have heard about comeback and causes it to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"for the conversations that I have led, people usually have been drained from 1998 or 1999 of their collection."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, sell now their CDs to buy their panels," says he. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of followers of a specific age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to recognize that records a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to WEZ, some of the older customers took advantage of the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">Some Balaton-fans will feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of familiar soundplattentions of objects of objects that are happy hoots.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it may be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says WEZ. "</seg>
<seg id="32">It is with me as a collector and I think it is the case with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like your social worker!" "a staff of a board stack."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey conducted by the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of the people who bought a record last month, they have not yet heard."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey was also found that 41% possess a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, do not have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned, while through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (data acquisition: three men middle ages) has noticed a" "trophy" "of Revivals."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came here only recently and said:" I have not a record player, but I would like to buy a radio plate so that I can put them into the shelf, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more producious, less musicor."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no turntables."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older who come only slowly."</seg>
<seg id="44">"stopover, which has devoted the sound-disc almost a whole floor, has a colorful audience than I'm going to go."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, teenager and women aged."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-standing shops - Wild Beasts's newest synthesizers and sexcpacker pop instead of experimental jazz, it is good to see such diversity among customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks strange, but the psychic traumas are hard to imagine if you are standing in addition to someone 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, runs around in the store for a few minutes and looks at the varicity of the records."</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more likely to have a mannequin than a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it does not deserve a lot, so the collection of boards is not a real option," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way but the beauty of records is... it drives with a loved sigh sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it really is unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I make the appearance to mute the jeans Hotpants, I observe a group of young teenager, who are grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a crosley turntable."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of panels of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential panels for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody can see them - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some so far above it is impossible to put them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "disk art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that every attraction for these things could mean more money for the industry and to send some clients into the depths Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as records."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my research showed that the results of YouGov will be right, let them at least exist in groundwater in Soho, the large number of female collectors and squadversaries, to exist in the reality, record, and in online."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they will not spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with strolling through record transactions of Berwick Street and the leaves through panels, while putting the rigid view of an uncanny, 30-year-old moderator, that rises over the shoulders of no middle aged men."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the impressive performance of Britain during 7-er Rugby arrived in the final on Thursday evening to a corrupt stop at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were struck with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro stage in Rio."</seg>

<seg id="6">"because singing is a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler of the German senior liga."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors sing in chorus and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"through regular assembly, seniors can establish social contacts and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"because they often solve social and familiar structures over the age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>

<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem grows by singing in a choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show itself: if I spend long for something, I will better and grow over me - this experience strengthens."</seg>

<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a tone next to it?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"in search of the appropriate offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"someone from the acquaintance sings in a senior enchyma, one can simply connect."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs around the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in an ecclesiastic choir can apply directly to the church or the church.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors can also be found via the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="2">"inter-members of the United States Central Command changed textbook information in order to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamist state in Iraq and Syria when it allowed the actual conditions on site to report a report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"preliminary report, created by a Task Force of Republican members of the Defense Committee, Secret Services and the Wehrbudgetee, reported on great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported as superiors to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic state."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military formations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"subsequent information presented by high-level CentCom Kommandemarks, typically a positive image of the American efforts against terrorism, as it had allowed the actual conditions on site and have been thoroughly more positive than analyses of other news services," a newspaper article added to the report. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what has happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering if poor analyses are presented to our political leaders," he established Ken Calvert, republican's member of the Representatives. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The leaders in the CentCom range up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-sided report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the education of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct evidence suggesting that government peaks have been given below Obama instructions, it shows how analysts were exposed to the pressure from their laws, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half year 2015 many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements from Congress were clearly more positive than the facts presented."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a CentCom has been publicly known that a military reconquest of Mossuls were already beginning in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mossul, second-largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigations, so much is clear." "said Mike Pompo, Republican Congress of Kansas, in an opinion."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of the year 2014 up to the middle of 2015, the tips of Central Command changed the afterglow reports to record the danger of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the Republicans called the Task Force, after it was played, that analysts are concerned with regard to the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while inquiries are continued.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigation of the CentCom reports are underway by the General-General Secretary of the Ministry of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the News Services published on Thursday released their own findings which coincides with some of the conclusions of Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"during the years 2014 and 2015 the CentCom created an overly restricted process for the creation of reheretic assessments to ISIL and the Iraqi security services, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in an opinion."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, such as Mr. ship," delayed the release of thoughtful reports "," the morality of analysts and "gave excessive space for softer opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but Mr. ship and the Democrats gave no indications of an intervention of the White House at the CentCom Analysts, with regard to a" certain political opinion "." "</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday through "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported by investigators by the general inspector of the Pentagon, which were included after complaints by CentCom Analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press review of the Pentagon, gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment any reports of Congress, while the investigation of the general inspections were still in progress."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also said that" experts sometimes have quite diverging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence Forces a controversial discussion on these important issues of national defense. "</seg>
<seg id="26">Inquiries made some feedback on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim which has now been made by an increasing number of members of the Department of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the accusations of the past year have raised the question to what President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism regarding the Islamist state remind of the Islamist state of more than ten years ago, as a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, presented a font from the recommendations of many analysts, such as the former occupation of the invasion of Iraq and little time on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thoughts."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a pivotal role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker after providing government proposals to oppose government proposals on the financial situation of the terrorist group had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, since these Provisional refineries were put into operation to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"however, this knowledge was not published, the Times reported in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Centcoms damaliger commanders, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for his excessive positive assessment of the war situation in a hearing in front of the Senate."</seg>

<seg id="9">The first-placed will get a little longer out of the way that the other group will lead.</seg>
<seg id="10">"whatever the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising host by their success story, four years after it landed in the past London games on the last of 12 places."</seg>
<seg id="11">Bam was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey racket (her two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years it became the national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008 as they could not qualify for the Kader.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012 in which she and her team went wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the next year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the National Team, and thus began to turn things towards better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a cultural change, an mental change and a bodily change," said Bam. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the workbook in London that we have now.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to tear the ruin completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the doormat in the first half of the game with a setback cover from the near-area.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India had gone without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprising tough and took the game from 1-0 to the third quarter until he took the game into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it carried out a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the center and lute the ball in the gate around the Americans a 2-0 guide."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the doorkeepers of the USA, Jackie Briggs who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of Trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, there are the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are stable and inescapably due to a rapid season between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's as if the olympic Fackel itself would be a burning stab that is passed from the bracelet to the Turner first to become triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can not switch on the TV to read a paper or listen to the conversation of your neighbor in the queue, without talking about Simone Biles, Katie Leepy or the argument between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a female schwarm by dimples, could quite have been sent under these known names that would be sent to Prime Time, created by sponsors and well-being-TV commercials if he would be a swimmer, Turner or even more fencer."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the olympic trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame does not see any event equally.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally recognized: air gun, archery, badminton, taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swim and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I can make humble arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the Trampolan event has already been an olympic event, when it had been a debut in Sydney, it was so sparsely noticed that many of whom I had asked, did not know that it is a Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the US has sent athletes to competition, it has never won a medal in trampolines and had a athletes who made it up to the final."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians who share the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"jumping on the trampoline has a certain outdoor chargeable charme, partly because it sounds more appropriate for an enlightened ear for a clownist school than that of the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only one enthusiast enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the kartoonous trembling of his never to end cloudy - but also the grace of the gymnast and diving, the two sports, which it essentially united."</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from Spanish El trampoline as much as springboard.</seg>
<seg id="22">"emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land at the feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to the official Olympics, you will be assessed according to the execution, difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"two-undous athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio with each other."</seg>
<seg id="25">The common olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallengers have to continue in their quest for gold, faster, upward, and go over, sometimes to finish, sometimes back and back, upwards and down on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall but also in the television transference also another height: that of the world or the Olympiad ords.</seg>
<seg id="28">"the purposeful aspiration is posh, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even stir up a spectator."</seg>
<seg id="29">"but it is also what I think, when looking at these games as something tiresome."</seg>
<seg id="30">"of this, the trampoline offers a reprieve."</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she prallt, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly again upwards."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during practice there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves at the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"qualifying and final clients will take place on Friday in the morning, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; those of the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will show the end of the final section as part of a afternoon from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of Olympia Manie, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked overlooked in general turmoil."</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters who demand political changes in Ethiopia and have a violent resistance to the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that sixty protesters were killed during the clashes with the police when they were killed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to break down?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid allies of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government the country and spread out more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people wned on the streets and slowed fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights, the government's response was relentlessly."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses mentioned that policemen were killed on zig unarmed demonstrators and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos on protests which are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how safety people are forced to beat young people with staves, while these were forced to make a hand stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN-Authority for Human Rights is now calling for an in-depth investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in future it will even become more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror over the region, especially Somalia. only a few countries in Africa if at all, get so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expansioned at considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">His infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital of Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the streets are generally quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continually led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited, the dissidents are effective to silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven into the expanse of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">Yet this could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"when you suppress people and these have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the floor to the stranglehold in terms of power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a continued election election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time tensions along the border to Eritrea are rising; a fight for these jagged, controversial line called on June hundreds of lives."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analyst fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which were forced more or less imposed over the last few years, would benefit the turbulences and retired."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of the bitterness after years of the herseals under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate through social media as the cheaper smartphone were getting more and more frequent and improved the Internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does in regular intervals, especially with protests, many people still can communicate via internet proxies that hide from where they stop."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians have believed that they gathered themselves up to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"eons since eons prospered the Amharas, which come from Ethiopia, mainly Christian powers, in politics and economy, while the Oromos exploited, many of whom are living and living in flat-areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But also this is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray that accounts for around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death on a non-publicized disease in the year 2012 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as tactical genius, a man who could think around the corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">"analysts say that he was particularly prescribed, to use early signs of dissatisfaction and instructed to handle opponents and to make them harmless."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in the current regime there is a lack of skill," "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analytic."</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected from relatively untransparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles. "</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray Region North-Ethiopian region, Mr. Hailemariam comes from south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst tell us that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia was living for such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands of elections were protested from the government and were then stolen by the government and subsequently stolen it."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following raids, many protesters were killed, even if it were less than in the last few months and this time of unrest was gone relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"Ethiopian Ethiopian Ethiopian leader for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new Pendowler, as well as for their measurable progress on poverty alleviation."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this has not prevented any intensification of the internal misunderstanding of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And she takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month of protests in Gondar, a amidlic city, of Tigray-guided shops, and the hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more and more common in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst tell that protests bring the US and other Western allies to a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even if it was recently closed, that it has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West wants to support democracy clearly, he does not want its allies to collapse in an already volatile area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "said Mr. Abdi," "is a very thin gratwalk."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his assertion Obama was founded ISIS "sarcasm."</seg>
<seg id="2">"on Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to dissipate the last controversy that surrounds his campaign by turning his multiple repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the" founder "of the Islamic State, not serious."</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarifying clear questions about the communication skills of the presidential race for the Republicans on whether it is able to communicate clearly and understandable to the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings his fellow-mates who seek to take him during an eventful phase in protecting the peculiar position, statements which he could not have been meant."</seg>
<seg id="5">"after he had made the clearance at an election event on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump had returned to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate the President and Mrs. Clinton had made ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the tweet was opposite to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews, he meant the accusation completely serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump, he wanted to weaken the statement of something that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential campaign wanted nothing to know about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the last storm of criticisms prasselt down to Mr. Trump, while he is trying to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling conversion levels to the economic situation."</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return again to this topic.</seg>
<seg id="12">"on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clintons's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already introduced sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he moved strong criticism to himself when he said, the Russians were to chop Mrs. Clintons e-mails, but he said later" Of course I said the sarcastic. "</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the language boundaries in politics and then return after demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of its methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans, as they arrive, and then if necessary" "clarify" "depending on how the reaction falls." "said Ruth Sherman, a communication experts who observe the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I think also, he is clever enough to keep his statements vage enough to be interpreted in different ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of resolute the sound of the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has assumed an even track of its sound, as its surveys have gone further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, which was published on Friday, showed a leading lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-in-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump in general tries to excuse for his provocative statements, he accuses his critics frequently to distorted his statements or to understand his humor."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he is strengthening the focus of attention during the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal fellow-mates to the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provocative might be his statements."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trumps most prominent speakers, gave great effort to defend candidates today in a CNN interview from Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "Mr. Giuliani so he asked to the accuracy of Mr. Trumps statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama was a almost unknown, small organization, he called them Lebänkler, completely wrong and therefore it happened, because he moved the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the mainstream Republicans attempt to argue that the government used under Obama, in the Mrs. Clinton as an Secretary of State, it is allowed to spread out to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and cast them off on each of his words to ride him and be taken against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he decks the" poor, jatrocity "television professionals who are trying to understand and said," "They cannot!" ""</seg>

<seg id="5">"it was an act of gastronomic solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," It was also a message to the Americans, as they should eat. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historiker.</seg>

<seg id="9">"their latest collaboration," A decent meal, "which will be published on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity, when they met with a reporter in Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, frills snack at the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh kesandwich with olive oil, while Coe, 57, Truthahn with mashed potatoes and vegetable-mixture ate."</seg>

<seg id="14">"there were peanuts, liver and savory."</seg>

<seg id="17">CoE grinste.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it has to have laid out in the stomach like lead," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-you-Can-Eat-buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"crews of women cooked for male rims and it was served freshly baked pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there were the Americans, who sent food to starving Europeans during the first World War." "A Square Meal" "draws the paths to which the country went with it, no longer the Schlaraffenland."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when eating for the Americans became a central, tense topic," begged coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new budgetary was just as tense: mysterious food such as breads and casassertion were made to staple foods, the Casserolle, as" wonderful way, the food waste, "said Ziegelman, since Köche was able to hide inappeable ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheap drydry.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rare luxury."</seg>

<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Grönlandhaie come most often only in winter to surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed after an investigation on board the Forschungsschiffs Sanna back to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swimmt with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandhaie got only 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"while the Grönlandhai floats along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is at an average of just 1.220 meters far."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it comes to it, the five meter long animal accelerates on around 2,6 km / h - and with this top speed, half as fast as a robe."</seg>
<seg id="9">This one of slowness on the way of life seems to be a panacea for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report to the journal" Science "at any rate of a Greenland, which could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">Madness "comments Alexander Scheuthanking by Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span which means to vertebrates a world record.</seg>
<seg id="12">"indeed, the evolutionary biologist already suspected that Greenland-sharks are stony."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only missing the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Grönlandhaie are difficult to observe, eventually they live mainly in the ice-sea facing the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually dive in the surface only in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">"on the lifestyles of Greenland-sharks, researchers know very little."</seg>
<seg id="17">Their time lugs were duped up at the same time when they killed six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">"loot: this sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbones of a young ice-bears."</seg>
<seg id="19">"possibly, they hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice cream and are looking for carcasses, which are from higher layers of layers below torturings."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland-sharks, which Fischer studied between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitzbergen as co-catching from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the greatest 502 centimetres."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens-14 method with the lens-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens is already created before the birth of the sharks, which the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest haie had a striking carbon-14 in the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">"however, their birth should lie after the early 1960s, as an atomic weapon, larger amounts of this radioactive carbon dioxide into the atmosphere shatched."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the length of 220 centimetres in length of the smallest animal contained the lens, against a low excess of carbon-14 out of the nuclear weapons, it might have celebrated his 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenland haie had in its lens against normal carbon-14 amounts caused by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14-clock for a 493 centimeters long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, during the record-shark with 502 centimeters even 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-shark females only then got afternobles when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers of the length were able to arrange an age."</seg>
<seg id="31">"as one of the animals of 392 centimeters probably stood on the threshold to the sexually mature ejaculation and his age has been determined with 156 years, Grönland haie with the multiplication is obviously at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is likely to be normal for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">"such methane hydrates mainly live in icy waters, is no coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="34">"also the previous record-holder, a 211 year old Greenland back, in whose speck at the neck, an 120 year old harpospeared was caught before Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, it is also common also the organism of the animals living there on savings."</seg>
<seg id="36">They mature just later - and alters slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep cold in cold water, the animals are often particularly large."</seg>
<seg id="38">"because the volume grows much faster than its surface, which allows the animal heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"so a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on it as early as possible, as early as possible as many descendants as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuthanlein. "</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raste last evening in the male team-Sprint in Velorom in Rio to glory when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor roller, which had made his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy. the young and made the legend proud, when he stormed back home to a victory from the favorites New Zealand."</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed four years ago a shocking victory while Hoy fetched the fifth of six Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="5">"you repeated the trick, after she took place in March by the train championships in London despite the resignation Hoys, only a modest sixth place."</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this time in time as Hinder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement got a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Skinner was the man, with whom they remained, when they saw the potential in the Scots, which has now developed."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hiny, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner put a Olympics in the Qualifier, but in the Standing-unden, the New Zealand courses won in the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"returning after his lap, but Kenny brought the team to the front and Skinner stopped."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a strategic change made a great deal of transformation, in which it was driving in a higher course to decelerate it and allow it Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the tempo."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked from his position as BBC expert, and fell in Skinner, Kenny and Hinder, when they came up on the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year Skinner from Glasgow said: "it is a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I am just here to do my best and to make a name for me.</seg>
<seg id="17">We spent a Olympics in the Endrunde and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph of 2012 on the side Kennys and Hoys said he fell on the train after a weak start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned later and there was no objection to England.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such an overraved victory, this time there was no such problem."</seg>
<seg id="23">"said:" "it feels all the UK flags on the jerking like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have joined the team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">"we have come so badly with so many world titles, that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which were seven from 10 titles both in Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">If such a barometer of our progress in the past five months is that we expect successful five days in the Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kenny it is in the realm of the possible that he has repeated Hoys's victory of three Olympic medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would be for Kenny - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (an apparently homey date for the British sport; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - an Ausute of six gold medals and a silver medals."</seg>
<seg id="30">The marvel of the people of Hoy alike.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Kenny takes part in the sprint, who starts today and will go over three days."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "I enjoy this only for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">"it feels something lonely, alone to win."</seg>
<seg id="36">"said:" "if he wins two other gold medals, he should be hit the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medal competition of the day, but there were more good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified himself with the fastest performance in the Vierer-four mileage race."</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at 3: 51.942 in the destination.</seg>
<seg id="40">"the World Cup, which was awarded in 2012 in London was 3: 51,659."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the first and final round (22 / 42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, at which Wiggins will focus on safety in the focus."</seg>
<seg id="42">"yesterday he had ended the qualification before the qualification, when the functionaries called him to measure his body size."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in the corresponding female competition, the morning continued and ended, avanced Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archisoon of Milngavie in world war period in 4: 13.260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on his strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and bring a shame to medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly exceptional display of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were run down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"drama was in the background, leaving the resignation of the technical guiding Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexism and mobbing, as well as retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, when one sees itself the first evening of the competition in Velodrom, it looks like the now famous reputation of GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment."</seg>

<seg id="10">"for a few Euro, lovers can still buy the equipment on the internet, but they are somehow derived from the time-time of the internet."</seg>

<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third drive, which is supported by £16 billion in private investments."</seg>
<seg id="15">The London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the enlargement of Heathrow will be one.</seg>

<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that are similar to those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have encountered similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously declared that the slow upheaval of the Venus could be explained by its tight atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation points out that Venus could have had a thin, erdgy atmosphere and still slowly revolved."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model lit also the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably referred to more dry regions than the earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and faster delay."</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus benefited from a sun that was 30 percent of matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the long-turn of Venus declared its daily side of the Sun almost two months," "GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio stated in a press release."</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which affects the surface of a large part of the sun's heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures that some degree cooler than that of the earth today are.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles the evolution, which previously was suspected by planetarium."</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers of Erpressungs-Malware to target currently targeted companies - and are successful in this process.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey of the malware-defense specialists Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany were 40 percent of surveyed companies in the past twelve months at least once, partly several victims of a attack with blackmailers."</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany nearly 20 percent of companies have already been the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims paid by the perpetrators requested by the perpetrators requested to be able to use the requested systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialises their blackmailings according to the observations of malwarebytes to attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"they are successful there, the potentially push-money is significantly higher than in private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a startling fast evolution of the damage software," explains Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the Malwareprograms were still designed to transmit advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then we discovered the perpetrators of blackmailing software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">"unfortunately, private users were the goal, but the change to company attacks was horrifying quickly in the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware is working according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of an offering, it searches for unlong changed files such as Word-, Excel- or database files as well as archives of pictures and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the Ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently the software presents the demands of the blackmailers.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in order to get the end-turn code to the files, the victims need money - mostly in the form of cryptogebitcoin - overpoint."</seg>
<seg id="16">"however, where in private users the personal photo database is on the game, it is related to sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is impacted."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage is caused when a ransomware suggests."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 per cent of the German firms affected by Ransomware, 13 percent had even forced to break the business operations, in a case people were in danger."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany several hospitals are victims of attacks, whose patients may be threatened by the loss of nursing women."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say to the victims always: do not pay, you only support the problem," explains Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 per cent of the companies that pay their dates back."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrator in view of standstill."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a current study the security researchers of F-Secure explores the payers and contact with blackmailings and come to the result: the perpetrators will actually try to build up a kind of customer service in order to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their sacrifice by chat, as they can pay by bitcoin, direct accessible support-sites or decode for free example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and people are redeemed on payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five digit sums in order to get their data undecrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the Ransomware blackmail, the hackers are becoming more and more professional and share the work, explaining security experts Chester Wisniewski by the anti-virus vendors Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware about a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is probable that three or four people are concerned."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening you have been working forever, at night it is hourly awake, in the morning there is no more to think of sleep in the morning before the wake-up."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adult sleep disorders, and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently restful."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or insomnia?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there are many causes due to them, Hans-Günter Wepour, board member of the German Society for Schlagety and Sleeping Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what you understand them, is however the insomnia, so a single and sleep-compulsive disorder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in fact, many people feel as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wageningen, member of the member of the German Housewage association with practice in the Lower Saxon Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind insomnia?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"behind it, organic, mental or conditional factors, but also medicines are stuck."</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the sleep-disorder expression of any other disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early waking up is mainly in case of depression," says Wepour. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that several factors would like each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for instance, who for instance has a bandry case, can be bad, wake up all the two to three hours and begin to salute you about all day issues and to pondering, weave an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When to talk to health care doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who are not asleep over a month of a month at least three nights per week and is not affected by the day should go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">"impairment can look completely different: it is sloping, tired, unexhausted, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood fluctuations or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate the sleep, it is important to figure out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"as treatment options, such as treatment options, a cognitive behavioral therapy, or even medicines - classical sleeping tablets are only in the exception and at the most no more for two weeks - question."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is hardly stressed in Germany, Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the interdisciplinary and Medical Center of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore, one should first contact the veterinary surgeon in the case of sleep problems."</seg>
<seg id="24">It can clarify with investigations if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should go to sleep, and what happens?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for examining in the sleeping laboratory medical care is for example with snoring with respiration, in disease-suffering, or if you do not find the cause of a sleepy disorder, beating spruce."</seg>
<seg id="27">You do not really need to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"please do not take a nap," says Fietze. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"after salutables, one goes to bed to his normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in addition to the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-brille, a chest strap and a butterfly at the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera draws to the ceiling the sleeping room."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can you get the problems with the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting drivers where you can get a better sleep for better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"pour counts on: regular sleeping and standing times, not too long in bed, do not sleep too long in bed, do not watch TV to sleep, alcohol avoid the night and at night do not start at the clock - then one starts to calculate immediately, and that is quite and not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="8">"after on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, the police had three weeks of official statements, according to 30 to 40 officials and three teams on the spot, unned parts of the road and kept visitors from entering the house with the number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown homeowners are the spaces."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin administrative course decided that the clearance was illegal, and one day later police and construction workers moved under the rejoicing of sympathisers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon, the street peacefull: parents go for walking with kids, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others are talking about Späti."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the building projects are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">"leftist force is not the main care of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the jaw since 1999, and Jana * that runs here three children mainly from the police presence."</seg>

<seg id="21">This is also visible in the tenants which have increased almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">"many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them in rected slices or newly-covered facades, which were ejected with colouring."</seg>
<seg id="23">"no other street was mentioned so often together with the words" "left-autonomous violence". ""</seg>

<seg id="7">"Regine customer from labour-circle indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the eives Wollmilchsau, who has above all a problem."</seg>
<seg id="8">"so, some - less spotting than on the multitude of conceptual areas were targeted, as the administration wanted to write the place."</seg>
<seg id="9">"searched for was a administration with a talent for languages and people, connected with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just an experience of Wollmilchsau."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organization, work with local people and also behind the scenes and network activities."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent spot on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine customer that Annika Deuschle Ehring and main actors. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are large and small problems, organisational, human and understanding problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers stand in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">"a serious problem has been to be found for some time, apartments for the titancies which have been acknowledged."</seg>
<seg id="18">"for the mounting, the municipalities are responsible."</seg>
<seg id="19">They have to accomodate refugees in their own or rented residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Landmark Office on the Commune and job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search for some time has been very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far it does not work so far, you should rely on private apartments, so Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, common homes must be respected as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, the Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a fixed stay, there are traineeship, training courses, training courses, A-euro jobs and subsidies for refugees and migrants, who have to be or established."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work at the Bauhof or help to master the housemaster, perform charitable work - and the motivates and very neat, like Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work of the community leads to a positive outinfluence.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a feeling of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so, there are offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here administration and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central that refugees get the feeling, they are welcome in Germany and welcome."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"you must explain the refugees that it takes and they can take the time meaningful, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who will eventually develop the feeling that he could not work in Urbach nobody, should not work and be unselfish, who will never be integrated."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"however, the problem is honest," people honestly, "people where nothing goes on." the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others. "</seg>
<seg id="47">"all that is already a" "mammoth task". ""</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do the two of the recent occurrences fear of radicalisation, even in a small village like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," "says Regine customer quite clearly," what some might be called naïve naïve "." a residual risk could and would not shut it out. "</seg>
<seg id="50">"sensitizes, the helpers are already."</seg>
<seg id="51">This incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the attacks bring them completely in revocation.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main - and volunteers do not have to go on site and in the region following activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">"in the background, they always found a new shock to refugees and migrants to Urbach."</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question clearly describes how politics gets.</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to put them on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we are not there yet, where we would like to go," "says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, this would be able to relax."</seg>
<seg id="62">"Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher have already been running smoothly, to integrate the existing people."</seg>
<seg id="63">"there are currently around 100 people, mostly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political situation is so complicated, there are no easy answers."</seg>
