Obama receiving news
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as by Teheran &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; but in the meeting , it should be a question of the conflict with the Palestinians and the reason@@ ed two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is eager for years .
Washington is cri@@ tici@@ zed on the ongoing settlement of Israel and raises a lack of hope in the peace process .
&quot; through the deal of Obama , Deal with the Iranian nuclear program has deterior@@ ated the relationship of the two further deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in March , Netanyahu held a deb@@ ated speech at the invitation of the Re@@ public@@ ans before the US Congress , which was partly as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not dism@@ is@@ sed with Obama , a meeting held this one with a reference to the im@@ min@@ ent election in Israel . &quot;
in a vocation led to have shot his girlfriend
in a notice I told Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb with a somewhat cru@@ sty voice of police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the police would have to come to his house .
&quot; Lamb was so important to emphasize that his &quot; swe@@ eter dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said , the family cont@@ ested the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; within the house the officers found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was attached to a white block : &quot; I am sorry , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who re@@ constructed in two on courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , and already 300 miles from the school grounds , E@@ than Schmidt , who shot and killed in his office according to the police . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ tic@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have shooting the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that he had made the f@@ ateful emergency .
by the end of the day there was another death : lamb took his life when the police knew him .
&quot; a day after the shooting in the university , the students and faculty to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what he motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by investig@@ ators at both the ends of the State , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw an image of a talented , but potentially difficult teachers to draw . &quot;
students said they were rejo@@ iced in his instruction .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have any history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history . &quot;
he himself had mentioned his book in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
&quot; in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty are 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some in@@ clin@@ ations to problematic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ a@@ vers , who ruled that he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; a different student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said he told him that he had told him at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress . &quot;
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that it was some health problem .
this year he set only two online courses .
&quot; the University &apos;s recent changes in employment policy of the university meant that the promotion , which was so hard for the Lamb , would represent no guarantee for an automatic path to a position as Assistant professor . &quot;
&quot; university President William La@@ For@@ ge said , he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot;
these are questions that he can not answer .
after the flight from the campus the police took little track later than he re @-@ drove in Mississippi from Arkan@@ sas .
&quot; he was arrested , and sle@@ w himself home with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &quot; on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car ran in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 he began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a town with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and studied geography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he graduated in spring in ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the many years of friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charismatic and funny . &quot;
&quot; she said Carla H@@ air@@ ston , she was 15 and he was 20 years old when she met together . &quot;
&quot; they and their friends were in high school , and he was the cool elder fellow who tried a couple of years to teach her the guitar game . &quot;
he was then the woman &apos;s flock back then .
&quot; all the girls are mol@@ ten when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson suburbs of Bran@@ don . &quot;
Lamb and chocol@@ ates were obviously some time together .
in the word &apos; I said &apos; I have killed my wife &apos; but there was no document of a marriage .
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house that is adjacent to a bath in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was in order .
&quot; ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but were friends and had a daughter who now was 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; he said he was never again , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss where he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail occurred three years ago both at a summer @-@ year market .
later they played together one or two others .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ inde@@ er was a nurse used for several businesses online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ man and sometimes convers@@ ational Co@@ ordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lighted bar near the Gau@@ tier , said that he &apos;s Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night ended in the night 5 September , having finished his guitar and mou@@ th@@ harmon@@ ic play in front of a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there were no signs that something was not right .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we were close up and jo@@ ked with each other .
I mean they both had a good sense for jo@@ kes .
&quot; Schmidt , the t@@ ote professor , conducted the initial semester @-@ seminar and specialized on American ab@@ orig@@ ines and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , a English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was the president of his group and the students .
&quot; at the Delta State campus in Cleveland took place on Tuesday evening about 900 people , including lectur@@ ers , employees , students and members of the municipality in a candle @-@ light ceremony . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ mid@@ ts wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt participated in the watch watch , during the University sti@@ cker &quot; B@@ right Morning Star &quot; and &quot; amazing grace . &quot; &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students for a return , &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ gel@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press Auth@@ ors Emily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans termin@@ ated this report . &quot;
&quot; this story was corrected to reflect that the police now says that he had shot the ma@@ eval , after he admitted Schmidt , and he called his wife &apos;s call for himself as his wife , but there is no indication of that the two have ever got married . &quot;
To@@ ys R Us aims to stop fewer workers on Christmas time

&quot; while the holidays are still away months , the Christmas business is coming closer and companies are preparing to place time employees to equi@@ p stores with staff that sell , send and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox is jo@@ king about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were waiting in the theatre on the Roy@@ als and I notice that the seat is empty next to me and it will slowly become clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film starts , and it comes to me in the sense that I am a simul@@ ated t@@ aps and an Ar@@ ame@@ ful length of it , with the princess of Wales with a date . &quot;

UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ Moon says that his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is &quot; &quot; There is no military solution &quot; &quot; of nearly five years of permanent conflict , and more weapons are wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN Chief calls on all parties , including the principal UN Security Council , to unite and integr@@ ative negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; B@@ an said a press conference held on Wednesday that he is planning to discuss the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the end of the min@@ us@@ cation of the Assembly to discuss this month , in order to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he de@@ pl@@ ores that the spl@@ its in the Council and the Syrian people and the Regional powers &quot; turn this situation un@@ sol@@ vable .
&quot; B@@ an called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in the at@@ tainment of a nuclear de@@ more than Iran . &quot;
8 revers@@ als show that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious to take .
some have tried to shoot him as a flop .
others have done him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how several Re@@ public@@ ans attempt to draw up Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks of the surveys , it did not work . &quot;
ten out of the last eleven National Pol@@ ls don@@ ate Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ dig@@ it area and some start to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the estate ads .
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
none of them claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win the Republican nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts say that at that time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys was released in the asc@@ ending Herman C@@ ain , none of which only gained a state in the Nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have in a general election to fight .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ le groups like Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise Tru@@ mp@@ s aver@@ aging and begin to let their dollars to flow , to pl@@ unge it . &quot;
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate @-@ mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary period :
Tru@@ mp@@ s Bel@@ popularity have turned around 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten Re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l . &quot;
up in the middle of July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
&quot; now , six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
about three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures keep themselves in the early states .
&quot; a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac voting in Iowa , revealed last week that 60 percent of the Re@@ public@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp . &quot;
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Re@@ public@@ ans said they would be &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; if Tru@@ mp would be nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say they were &quot; angry , &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot;
&quot; just Ben Car@@ son will provide about the same enthusiasm like tur@@ f ( 43 per cent , they would be &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent , which say the same about Tru@@ mp ) . &quot;
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 per cent of republi@@ can voters said they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied or &quot; upset , &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favourite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate would be . &quot;
a majority of the Republican sees Tru@@ mp@@ s temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely known for its bom@@ bas@@ tic and ins@@ ul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of the Irish citizens are aware that the real estate was the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC news / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same figure is in the first an@@ cho@@ ky state of the nation , from the state of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of the Re@@ public@@ ans think that he has the personality for a su@@ preme commander , according to the Quin@@ ni@@ fer@@ ac final week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to perform effectively and nearly six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his tem@@ per does not go to the White House for ABC / Post . &quot;
republi@@ can voters are adap@@ ting to the idea .
&quot; when they set up their schol@@ ar , Republican voters maintain Tru@@ mp for real . &quot;
&quot; once they asked , who most likely the GO@@ P Nom@@ ination wins , after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week four out of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s a change from time , when four out of ten end of July did its money on Je@@ b Bush . &quot;
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters have not had the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this time in the final cycle , four of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination just over 28 % for the final candidate fellow Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , a large number of GO@@ P voters will see Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign as plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even when the re@@ public@@ ans gather for a different candidate , Tru@@ mp is propos@@ ing almost everybody . &quot;
some experts warn that the sh@@ atter@@ ing field would probably contribute to Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s guidance while the anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is distributed on more than a dozen of other candidates .
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that there is a hypothe@@ tical mind @-@ race race between Tru@@ mp and most of the other republic candidates , tru@@ mp the majority . &quot;
&quot; before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points lead , Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally to Rand Paul , John Ka@@ ja and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
this is a head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who hits him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entre@@ preneur with 19 points in a hypothe@@ tical head @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans says that they have formed their minds .
&quot; a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the elec@@ tors , ass@@ isting the Tru@@ mp , say that they have given their voices . &quot;
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can truly say , never change the mind . &quot;
&quot; 46 % said they were open the door open , to change to other candidates . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , Tru@@ mp@@ s most powerful competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters said that they have formed their minds , are twice that common to Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans tell them that they are consistent with Tru@@ mp in immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp in his election campaign was named after two months immigrants from Mexico , &quot; rap@@ ists , &quot; immigration was a central bank at the public discourse in 2016 . &quot;
some are worried that the bom@@ bas@@ tic expres@@ siveness of Tru@@ mp is greatly affected by the Republican party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but following the new ABC / Post survey on Monday 6 of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say that it coinci@@ des with Tru@@ mp about immigration .
&quot; as long as immigration does not remain in the spotlight , Donald Tru@@ mp is going to do . &quot;
the frustration of the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
&quot; in the meantime Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son will now account for about half the support of republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ sider status . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mont@@ g@@ ags , and they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with the government experience . &quot;
and they are also anger@@ ed at Washington .
&quot; a survey by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register , Bloom@@ berg , Iowa two weeks ago show that three of four Iowa public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated over the Re@@ public@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five exclusive living areas of Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ bit trail is the most expensive residential area - with views of the North sea @-@ watt .
on the road a square meter of a roof terrace in the section 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the range of objects is naturally limited , in the study it says - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study reveals in which special layers are a square meter the most cost .
&quot; of course , € 18.@@ 70 per square meter for a student school in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; but unlike the top of Germany &apos;s top accommodation , but from the price of pe@@ anu@@ ts . &quot;
the real estate company Angel &amp; Völk@@ ers published a leaderboard of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euro nothing - per square meter , fine . &quot;
but good to who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich here is not at the top of the exception .
Champions League : Bayern @-@ Dream start thanks to Müller and Gö@@ tze
ri@@ ck Tor@@ tu@@ ck in Pi@@ re@@ aus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a earned 3 : 0 on Olympi@@ ac@@ os Piraeus - then ran &apos; s .
a sovereign kick @-@ off of the Champions League season .
&quot; the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Th@@ es have contributed to FC Bayern in the Hex@@ enk@@ es@@ sel from Piraeus a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their prize game in the Champions League at the Greek recru@@ iting Master Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Mü@@ llers dou@@ ble@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9th ) .
the twel@@ fth calendar of the series will be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola will finally want to catch the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t after Munich .
Müller was awarded with his 2@@ 8th hit in the Champions League for Bayern @-@ tour operators of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ ra@@ Roberto which resulted in an flan@@ k @-@ thought of the master &apos;s shot .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate it , had Bayern @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m before the game in the Kara@@ is@@ k@@ akis @-@ Stadium in pre @-@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated concept without gl@@ it@@ tering .
&quot; Pi@@ re@@ aus had won his latest six home games in the Royal @-@ class , among them well known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
in 2011 she stum@@ bled here also Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but Bavaria , in seven Europe @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they courageous courageous , with their offensive efforts , but often in@@ tim@@ elessly to works . &quot;
the attacks were often initiated by the reloc@@ ation of the Douglas Costa drum by the former Braunschweig region Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
&quot; Müller had more luck far from the right , than its side in the upper part of the upper part of the upper basin . &quot;
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the potential 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
first of the Olymp@@ ics @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ a Brown suggested the pel@@ ball of Poland on the line ( 26 ) .
&quot; then by direct delivery , the tar@@ ra@@ e Roberto with her knees ( 3@@ 5th ) . &quot;
&quot; although Bayern played their usual dominant game , I was able to get Piraeus . &quot;
in the keeper Manuel Neu@@ er but he was lost .
so as he took a shot of ide@@ ye on the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
&quot; before Neu@@ er Gu@@ ardi@@ ola left a four @-@ storey with David Al@@ aba , the center alongside Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Th@@ rough , after muscular problems back in the Ka@@ der , sat first outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero was given only after the final funer@@ al light , &quot; said Sport@@ bi@@ standing Matthias Sam@@ mer by &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; whoever wants to make something different from it , that is really bad . &quot;
&quot; in the first change Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was decided against him , when he was in King@@ sle@@ y Com@@ an on the Le@@ wand@@ owski Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot;
&quot; dol came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) , and made 13 minutes later everything clear , by El@@ f@@ metres Müller appointed a lot . &quot;
in front of the game it was at the stadium to attack .
&quot; after a smaller group of partially collap@@ sing Bavaria fans in their viewer , apparently the supporters of the host had prov@@ oked elsewhere with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went with bat@@ ons against the Munich trailer . &quot;
at least one Bayern @-@ fan has been injured from the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; he who smo@@ kes , cuts not only of the lungs , but also to the teeth - that puts a Potsdam @-@ long @-@ term study near . &quot;
the good news : with reno@@ un@@ cing the risk fast .
smokers are at a significantly elevated risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this is generated from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several members of the German Institute of Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to non @-@ smokers , the risk of smoking was a risk of losing their teeth in mat@@ urely to the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3.@@ 6 times higher . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
&quot; major causes of dental treatment , c@@ aries and inflamm@@ ations of the tooth loss , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis smoking is a risk factor which emphasises the authors .
the connection between smoking and dental loss can therefore be attributed to frequent f@@ are@@ gi@@ tis in smokers .
un@@ clari@@ fied whether smoking is also increasing the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; people who have listened with smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it could take over ten years , until the danger to the level of non @-@ smoking , Er@@ du@@ red Thomas Diet@@ rich stated by the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; people needed to convince people to be non @-@ smoking , then , leader of a Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; smoking su@@ pl@@ unges the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and also leads to a good dental health up to the high age .
&quot; in Germany more than 20 per cent of the population at the age of 65 to 74 have been affected by law@@ lessness , the DI@@ AL@@ E shared . &quot;
previous investigations have already pointed out that smoking is the risk for early dental failure .
the new long @-@ term study support the findings .
archae@@ ologists res@@ igns in Köl@@ ner Rhein@@ u@@ fer in remains of the late @-@ term
&quot; for repeated times , on the right of the R@@ hen@@ u@@ fer in Cologne arche@@ ological discoveries have been made . &quot;
&quot; in the vicinity of the building site for the new Rhein@@ boulevard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings are excav@@ ated , &quot; Museum of Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the construction of the buildings on the Rhine , historians have been out of the search for so @-@ called bottom @-@ monuments . &quot;
&quot; as a result of all construction projects in the Municip@@ ality of Cologne , the Museum has always been held as the Department of Archae@@ ology of Archae@@ ology . &quot;
in the third section of the Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ards the archae@@ ologists were now found .
&quot; some text documents have already been known that in the fourth century a fortress was established in the fourth century , and in the 8th century there was a church in Trier . &quot;
&quot; along with lef@@ to@@ vers of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery was discovered with about 350 tom@@ bs , probably belonged to the church . &quot;

EU @-@ Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; &quot; &quot; to increase the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlantic free trade agreement , the EU Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be super@@ se@@ ded by a more transparent system which in its functioning is considerably more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system which citizens trust , &quot; &quot; declared the relevant EU Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ ström in the launch . &quot;
the Swe@@ de emerged to bring the proposal as European negotiating positions in the free trade talks with the United States .
the German government announced support .
TTIP must be the largest free trade area in the world with 800 million people .
plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings are in particular that the EU states and the USA choose to jointly select independent judges for a new investment fund .
&quot; they are supposed to be made in equal parts of the EU , the USA and third countries . &quot;
it is also planned for the first time a second instance .
it would allow it to raise against jud@@ g@@ ments .
&quot; to date , the proceedings involved meet each other so far as arbitr@@ ators , a single objection to their jud@@ g@@ ments . &quot;
the discussion of the past few months has become clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fairness and justice is not trusted .

&quot; the entire audience , about 40 persons , is almost caught by Stev@@ ens lecture . &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns Deb@@ debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gment
&quot; ever since its election Mr Cor@@ bi@@ ns &apos;s debut in the Prime @-@ Minister , the Prime Minister is expecting them . &quot;
the new Labour @-@ chairman Jerem@@ y Cor@@ bi@@ n must be his debut in the Prime @-@ Minister and set up for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ bi@@ n fails to raise the first of his six pre @-@ given questions shortly after mid@@ day when his performance by the media is most likely to be examined .
he called &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some meetings to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns and after his appointment it becomes a member of the S@@ att@@ enk@@ inet@@ ts and his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting in Tuesday after his appointment .
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour Code , on Tuesday during the singing of the National An@@ them at a memorial ceremony of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain have prov@@ oked in silence , cri@@ tici@@ zed by a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and stands at the center of several title stories . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ si@@ ns decision not to do the National An@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ bi@@ n said he had been &quot; &quot; dis@@ respectful silence &quot; &quot; and he recognized the hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the air battle for England . &quot;
&quot; but one member of Mr Cor@@ bi@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , expressed in the BBC Two News@@ night program , he got the Labour president , the National An@@ them to sing , &quot; independently &quot; of his faith that the monarchy was to be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of the shades of Min@@ ds have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ bies of the team , and she calls him differences in economics , defense and foreign affairs , while less than a six@@ teenth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party was originally supported as leaders . &quot;
&quot; the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC International Bran@@ t says that political differences are also among the Labour &quot; st@@ acking , &quot; and after Mr Cor@@ by@@ l &apos;s statements to the European Union and the limitation on winn@@ ings . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ bi@@ n told the TU@@ C Conference to put Labour amendments to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
&quot; later , Mr Smith , the Sha@@ dows of the Labour and pensions @-@ ministers showed that the Party was &quot; very clear &quot; that they should only bring down the government plans to reduce the limit of 26.@@ 000 £ on 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ bi@@ n is Mr Cameron the fifth Labour chairman David Cameron since he is th@@ ory chief so far over the D@@ isp@@ atch box in parliament has gone over the last decade .
&quot; the Labour chair that promised a different policy sentence , says that he has given &quot; crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and have given him more than 30,000 stimul@@ us . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ l@@ ington North MP said that the Prime Minister was to be made to confron@@ ting the Prime Minister , and that he has made a compromise with resistance and compromise with resistance and compromise himself to serious problems such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ bi@@ n admitted that Angela Eagle , representing the shadow of business min@@ istri@@ es , when he is not participating - for example , if Mr Cameron comes abroad . &quot;
&quot; he has also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues draw the word occasionally , and that he spoke John Ber@@ s@@ cow , the speaker of the house , I discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cameron , when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he was often linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s style in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le The@@ aters . &quot; but several years later he sp@@ ake that he failed . &quot;
&quot; as she was first sent on television in 1990 , the leader with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer and his leadership , held in the House of Commons and his position among his parliamentary groups , even though critics have argued , it became a caric@@ ature and warrant further reforms . &quot;

Po@@ unds rises through accelerated wage growth in the UK
&quot; the Po@@ und increased dramatically to the data that has an increase in the pay@@ age of the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE was 100 by the team of SA@@ BM@@ iller . &quot;
between May and July the result without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage was the fastest and experienced ass@@ ess@@ ments at the time of an interest rate .
&quot; the pound rose by over 1 % compared to the dollar on $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro at 1,@@ 37@@ 30 € . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % on 6.@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share of the market and made a jump of 20 % after the acquisition of the ri@@ val AB launched .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest brewery in the world and bring together marks as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were looking for encouraging news from the competition for luxury goods F@@ M@@ ont &apos;s 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts &apos;s newest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry and again growth .
&quot; cash stock rose by 5 % , after the mining party said that he took 2.5 billion $ through stock sale as part of its strategy of debt management . &quot;
&quot; the shares of the packaging and paper company MON@@ DI were the largest los@@ ers in the index , and with a decline compared to 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had already set its assessment for the company R@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; J@@ D Sports increased by 3.@@ 1 % , after a pre @-@ tax earnings of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million had been reported for the half @-@ year . &quot;
the leader of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages end@@ anger the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers would be &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this transaction will compens@@ ate the higher labour for his company , says he . &quot;
&quot; the cost could take the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean it will be less additional jobs . &quot;

PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster illustr@@ ates Lebanese - Pot@@ el@@ d@@ ön@@ er idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
&quot; it is both - and in the restaurant of the potato , which the Ol@@ denburg patron saint Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y has developed . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the sp@@ ru@@ ch &quot; &quot; potato &quot; &quot; on a poster of the PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A movement , Al@@ ha@@ y potato and meat was put together at a jav@@ elin . &quot;
the idea brought him a poster with a PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; potatoes rather than D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; which he had seen by chance on TV . &quot;
&quot; since then , it has been a bar@@ be@@ que in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is mul@@ ticultural for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y . &quot;
the idea has now been introduced to the Leb@@ an@@ ese in Munich in the meantime .
&quot; meanwhile , the data has been protected as a utility model for a short period of time . &quot;
&quot; how much meat and how much potatoes of the sk@@ e@@ wer contains , Al@@ ha@@ y does not want to betra@@ y something . &quot;
&quot; just as much : &quot; it tastes much better &quot; , &quot; he finds . &quot;

Met@@ cash starts floor orientation campaign to fight al@@ arms
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the Ig@@ A branch in front of an Al@@ di @-@ march in South Australia and Western Australia .
&quot; food wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ a@@ quired has started a ground level campaign to defend the market share of Ig@@ A retailer in South Australia and Western Australia in advance to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion . &quot;
&quot; while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and Ig@@ A @-@ supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build up the brand Ig@@ A through mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing over the social media , as well as events such as Adelaide @-@ show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A @-@ dealers and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands such as Eis@@ berg S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ rück , who distributed in Ig@@ A @-@ shops samples and shop owner , the authorised tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; the cash of further details of its defence strategy will be published on September 29 if the wholesale distributor for food , alcohol and equipment will carry out its annual investors strategic strategy . &quot;
&quot; it is a lot about the game , since South Australia and Western Australia span almost 30 percent of Met@@ e@@ ash@@ s Ig@@ A @-@ frei@@ ghter and generate higher profits than Met@@ e@@ ash@@ s Ig@@ A @-@ Network in the East . &quot;
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally par@@ o@@ zi@@ ell and Ig@@ A retailer have a much stronger market share as in New South Wales and Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to some 14 per cent in East Australia .
&quot; however , an@@ alysts like Morgan Stanley , that Al@@ di has twelve months after opening its first markets around five percent of the food market in these two states and take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers sales . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published in this week , the Analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stanley , that Ig@@ A @-@ retailer 360 $ million revenues a year and Met@@ o@@ cash will lose $ 250 million until the end of 2016 . &quot;
the progn@@ osis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens to WA in the next year in SA and 30 in WA and will generate sales of 500 million $ and 600 million in every market .
&quot; the amount of food and gro@@ c@@ eries , and the quantities at Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high Fi@@ x@@ cost @-@ based cas@@ cash , cash of approximately 13 million $ earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time Met@@ cash will lose market share in the East @-@ states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ eman , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan , found that Ig@@ A @-@ shop@@ pers are the tre@@ u@@ est . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stanley assumed that Met@@ e@@ ash@@ s revenue grew by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.6 percent in 2017 and will decrease the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week &apos;s leading fund managers Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , reported at a business in Melbourne that Met@@ cash probably will disappear within a decade . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ a@@ leh@@ rejected it , publicly responding to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass . &quot;
&quot; however , it is considered that a member of the Council of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass last week has made contact . &quot;
&quot; IG@@ A &apos;s market share has increased from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ e@@ ash@@ s Supp@@ lements , which has roughly 1,@@ 200 percent , which represents the operating debt degra@@ dation to turnover and mar@@ gins since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; but wholes@@ al@@ ers try to invest more than 150 million $ , about selling prices with col@@ es and week@@ lies in hundreds of products every week , and Ig@@ A @-@ retailers in order to improve their stores by more rapidly growing fresh foods and to provide a better selection of private label foods . &quot;
Met@@ e@@ ash@@ s main managing Director Ian Mor@@ rice says that pricing and store @-@ application programs are to be put on El@@ an and hopes that the wholesale distributor in 2017 will return to profitability for the first time in four years .
Tan@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis is supported by President of the Australian tennis ship Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis deserves more praise than criticism of his behaviour .
&quot; Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis was one of the &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; in the recent temp@@ est by his friend Nick Cro@@ gios and worthy of view of the President of the Australian tennis club Steve E@@ aly and deserves praise as criticism of his own behaviour . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ akis , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who repeatedly referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; by the in@@ famous meditation of Arn@@ gios to Stan Wa@@ br@@ ka in the Montreal Masters in the spotlight . &quot;
&quot; in a fiery qualification game , Kok@@ kin@@ akis said and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice had to be separated by the refer@@ ee , and Harrison , had to knock , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; finally , while he was last seen , how he cr@@ ushed a tennis r@@ ack@@ et after a cr@@ amp was faced with a potential US Open @-@ win by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ akis was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is now in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth , in order to finish the second place in the single @-@ quarter behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup finals . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I am quite en@@ vious of is the fact that after my view Tan@@ asi , a little bit drawn into the dispute , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a r@@ ack@@ et when he lost a p@@ endant in US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a r@@ ust from frustration of himself , and I know Than@@ asi &apos;s good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the fairly voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of appreciation . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around himself , and I believe that he was a little too strictly treated . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 year old , he works very hard , and he fits in the team and so on , he has never been a problem with the other players he is working hard , he is well in shape , he is a very sturdy and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision , which does not take into consideration when the important preliminary decision will not be taken into account when Friday begins , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he believes the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term integral part of the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is fully focused on the competition and not to all the controversi@@ es of the Masters , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; and I believe that Nick felt very quickly made Ascension , what people like fe@@ ather s and Murray have pointed out . he is rising in the eyes of the public and he deserves to assist him . some time outside the li@@ mel@@ ight , in which he can only think about it , I consider it appropriate for the team and it is the best for him . &quot;
&quot; refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency resistance , closes the border , holds refugees back &quot;
&quot; Hungary explains the ma@@ d@@ ment and ri@@ p@@ pled the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and kept all the firm , who tried to get illeg@@ ally into the land . everything with the goal to stop the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
chaos followed at the border as hundreds of migrants in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land was re@@ acted and Serbian officials with rebellion .
the people who fled from violence were were hidden for an unknown time in a ro@@ am of the street between the two control points of the lands and set up tents and settled down there .
&quot; however , frustr@@ ations rose on . &quot;
&quot; when a police helicopter ride over them , the migrants &quot; Op@@ ens the limit ! &quot; and sm@@ elled ins@@ ults against the Hungarian self @-@ feeding . &quot;
some meadows from protest food and water back .
Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister explained it is &quot; unacceptable that migrants would be returned from Hungary while more and more from Macedonia and Greece are arriving .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a colleague .
&quot; over the coming days there will be talks with Brussels and other countries , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence at the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came to an agreement that a day after the 28 @-@ nations bloc in Brussels could not agree a common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the ministers promised to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the over@@ arch@@ ed Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that in the next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would pick up additional 120@@ ,000 refugees among them , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
Hungary however did not put his hopes on a timely action of Brussels or from its neighbours .
&quot; the emergency booth divided into two southern regions was more of the powers to cope with the crisis , so they could block roads and accelerate roads and asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire at its border with Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country , having finished a fence at the Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even Pr@@ ison Affairs was getting used in the race , the bar@@ bed wire , between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a considerable cru@@ ises in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a considerable cru@@ de to the European Union . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban had insisted that most incoming business leaders are on the search for a better life and not the people @-@ refugees who are entitled to protection - a view which is strongly contrary to other EU countries , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which occurred around midnight in Hungary , make the crossing the border or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall in front of crossing the government on the southern border with Serbia , led to a crime . these laws also set higher pen@@ alties for convic@@ ted traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian Government declares the state of emergency , &quot; said government of Zol@@ tan Kov@@ á@@ cs re@@ porters in the southern city Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the parliament must comp@@ ressing the processing of the military even the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have over@@ looked at the border of armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs already on day @-@ to @-@ day basis . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities have lost 45 people when trying to cross the border , 15 others had already moved deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come from , by damage the fence , they are now in police custody and are charged to acc@@ use criminal off@@ ences for the new laws . &quot;
authorities are trying to fix the fence quickly .
&quot; on Tuesday morning joined two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon was joined with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos killed the most important border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to edit the data of people and put an crowd to settle down there . &quot;
&quot; some 20 managed to come into , but thousands stayed outside . &quot;

&quot; the former Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a two @-@ dig@@ it lead over the democratic race for nom@@ ination at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in contrast to the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton receives the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the elections ( 58 percent previous ) , while S@@ anders was second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den who has not yet announced , whether he will be president of the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters in the election elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is what candidates will support them . &quot;
but Cl@@ int@@ ons Sup@@ porters are in their choice as those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS @-@ news pol@@ l , Clinton had lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups while S@@ anders achieved some profits . &quot;
Clinton holds a major lead in women and moder@@ ates but these projections have less@@ ened .
&quot; your support in the men is decreased significantly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; cl@@ int@@ ons benefit in democratic constitu@@ ents less than 50 years ago , and they and movements are now on the same level . &quot;
but Clinton still has a big advantage with the older voters .
&quot; but last month Clinton was a five @-@ point lead at the Liber@@ als two weeks ago , but S@@ anders has a 5 point lead at this group . &quot;
&quot; half of the democratic values of the elections nation@@ wide say nation@@ wide , that they would support the Clinton that it was nominated by the Party . &quot;
&quot; one quarter would support it with some reservations , and further 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate . &quot;
six percent would not support them .
maybe not surprising that Cl@@ int@@ ons &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her .
the views are more intense on those who currently not support Clinton - only about one quarter would it support it .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic values of the elections pro@@ sel@@ ections that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less Republican voters say this about their top @-@ class data Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 per cent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Cl@@ ou@@ &apos;s supporters may be asked in an open question why they want to have the candidate , is the most common answer that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the fact that it &apos;s time is that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; by Cl@@ ou@@ &apos;s supporters , her connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned . &quot;
consent to dealing with the problems and the elec@@ tor@@ tures are also cited .
&quot; as the Vice President receives a potential for the presidential office in the orph@@ an@@ ages , 57 per cent of the democratic voters of the elections will see him in the race - even though a third believes that he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked to elections , who for the party were her second election , Bi@@ den is at the head . &quot;
&quot; with Cl@@ ou@@ ons &apos;s followers , more than half , that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far in front of him . &quot;
&quot; as a result , Bi@@ den , does not decide for the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , Hill@@ ary Clinton lifted a jump in front of S@@ anders , of 20 points with bi@@ des in the race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate to win the best opportunities to win , but that &apos;s decreased by 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ den is by far a second with this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; still , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ torate . &quot;
&quot; similarly as in the last month , not a single democratic candidate or potential candidate for the voters of the US elections is as unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results in some important characteristics with the elec@@ torate of the elec@@ torate of their party .
&quot; maj@@ orities are viewing , Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong guidance . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ den cuts the top three candidates at the best in honesty , while Cl@@ int@@ ons &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is truly and trustworthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinion of it . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters of the elections also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , roughly a quarter of democratic voters has no opinion of His own . &quot;
&quot; questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton need to use a personal email address and a server during the term as an aux@@ ili@@ ary minister , most of the Democratic voters are pleased with their statement of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public altogether .
&quot; half of the Americans now are dis@@ satisfied with their declaration , while only one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion about this occurred in March , shortly after the problem came to the light they split . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no effect on the general opinions of Clinton , although 36 per cent said that their opinion might still deterior@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly Re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of 10 , who say that their views from Clinton have become bad . &quot;
&quot; although in spite of the voters of their party as honest and trustworthy , this is a problem for them among voters elec@@ torate . only 32 percent watch them as honest and trustworthy , eight percent less than last month , and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of the elec@@ torate entitled them not for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time 55 percent of the elec@@ torate @-@ nation@@ ally nation@@ ally also look at Tru@@ mp as not honest and not trustworthy .
&quot; however , Clinton and Tru@@ mp are good notes of the leaders . &quot;
&quot; from the six tested candidates Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best were cut in honesty . &quot;
&quot; a majority also looks more likely to be fran@@ k , but just as Car@@ son did not have any opinions of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 vessels in the pre @-@ elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves forward with country@@ wide survey near Donald Tru@@ mp
Ben Car@@ son is present at the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times correctly behind Donald Tru@@ mp
&quot; on the two candidates , half of the elec@@ torate dis@@ es in the new survey , and others lose dramatically . &quot;
&quot; republi@@ can voters support nation@@ ally nation@@ ally in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % in recent C@@ BS survey , which was conducted by Fox News debate last month , about 27 % in the survey conducted by Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son hit the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son meets demo@@ graphic groups very well and Tru@@ mp among republi@@ can voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , except Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ ou@@ sel , is named with Wiscons@@ ins , governor Scott Walker , who fell on the deepest pass of 10 % support last month . &quot;
&quot; the former Florida Gover@@ nor Je@@ b Bush , the former governor of Arkan@@ sas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are located at 6 % in the third place . &quot;
the bug fixes on the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republican voters in this recent pol@@ l is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week shows that Car@@ son falls in the pol@@ ls - he lands with 19 % support among the re@@ public@@ ans , behind the tur@@ f with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent survey by ABC news / Washington Post revealed Tru@@ mp distinc@@ tly before Car@@ son .
&quot; looking at one in the last week of Car@@ son An@@ son found Tru@@ mp a few side drives for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ologi@@ zed for it to question Tru@@ mp@@ s belief . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp on last Saturday during a campaign show in Iowa . &quot;
comfortable bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even though peak values are measured only in the distance , sufficient for bath@@ tu@@ bers have a trip to the Mediterranean in order to find still warm water . &quot;
a bath in the North or the Baltic Sea is likely to be a somewhat short enjoyment of a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some more points out of the sea : maximum 18 degrees , the water in the North and Baltic Sea is divided this week , the German Weather Service ( D@@ W@@ D ) shares . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , bathing temperatures still offers the Mediterranean : in the East it is even up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; the Adriatic Sea is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt is coming to 28 degrees .
five members of the Con@@ fratern@@ ity stressed with the death of a Bar@@ uch College no@@ vice
&quot; almost two years after a student during a hard @-@ we@@ ave ritual at a student service in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , cap closures were ordered against five people . &quot;
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College Pi @-@ Delta @-@ PS@@ I @-@ Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a introduc@@ tory positions in September 2013 and prevented his transp@@ orts to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police shared with them . &quot;
&quot; officials said that he had been charged with associated eyes with a 30 pound ru@@ ck@@ sack full of sand , and repeatedly att@@ ack@@ ened , while trying to walk over a frozen field on a goal . &quot;
Mr. Den@@ g finally sang about headaches but then he fell unconscious .
&quot; the members of the Pi @-@ Delta @-@ PS@@ I @-@ Brotherhood did not give the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ fully restored and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to switch to Den@@ g clothing , his symptoms to goo@@ gling and Andy Men@@ g to contact national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , told police said Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at that point the members of Uz@@ ziah began to hide and set the welfare of the Brotherhood basically about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ tic@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not revi@@ ved , and he died in the following morning at his wounds . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ pen@@ wei@@ gh@@ er , Den@@ g repeatedly fell to shoulder @-@ mut@@ ed forces of injury to head , torso and thi@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the har@@ ass@@ ists of the Brotherhood . at least one student perc@@ ei@@ ves every year at the Schi@@ kan@@ en , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer , the Den@@ g family representative , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and its members must be held to account , and this step by the authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury from Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment due to Mor@@ a Third degree for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also indic@@ ted for a criminal attacks and the formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not just want to take responsibility for the persons involved , but if there is an organization which - officially or un@@ officially - this is sanc@@ tioned , we will also hold it to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; our Gu@@ est@@ book College has forbidden the Brotherhood , and the national fratern@@ ity has contradic@@ ted its affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; a tax @-@ loss comes from , and the house shall come to tot@@ ter , and ren@@ ditions for bonds will rise , and the economy will slip into a recession . &quot;
this is what we know .
&quot; what we don &apos;t know is how long it all take , and how long it will hold it . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the story of the economy offers only a small guide to the procedure . &quot;
a recession came to the first savings within just 11 months and took up to 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ siveness of the Federal Reserve on the rise of interest rates is often , although not always , a factor inside , such as the economy and the financial systems react . &quot;
&quot; therefore representatives of the US bank of Central Bank stressed so severely , that investors should not focus on what it begins to increase interest rates , but rather the time period that is needed for norm@@ alisation . &quot;
in fact multiple variables are playing a role .
&quot; in the end , market participants could notice that the whole excitement was exagger@@ ated because of interest loss . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inevitably interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Che@@ fö@@ con@@ om near Capital Economics , in a communication to the customer . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal levels , but still at a low level in order to fear for se@@ is@@ mic upheav@@ al that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean there will be no re@@ percus@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; here , one of the historical trends of art could be based on how some areas of the economy might respond : &quot;
&quot; as the market has been seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest pay@@ outs can make things a little more volati@@ le . &quot;
&quot; once the increase occurred , the influence is not that dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that Ver@@ ses from 12 to 24 months after the first increase was postpon@@ ed , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank observers in a recent study to what happens after confirming the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more precisely , the market during the past 35 years is mostly in the upward trend - roughly 14 per cent along the road to tax @-@ mining , fairly flat during the last six days ( average profit of 2.@@ 6 percent ) , then back to normal analysis , the Bob Dol@@ l , Chief Investment Re@@ strateg@@ ist in Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s Asset Management . &quot;
Deutsche Bank says that the impact on the shares tend to occur later in the Hei@@ ghtened Cycle and the return will begin to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest groups are promoting them often . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that could not exist before and could accelerate the recession . &quot;
very remarkable is that in its gross domestic product will be close to its lowest mark on savings of the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , 118 bri@@ des took place against 118 bri@@ ties since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP at 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3,@@ 6 per cent , only a few expect this to last and expect the third quarter to receive information from Atlanta F@@ ed to 1.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; the interests of interest in such a fragile economic backdrop could pose risky and throw the question , &quot; &quot; whether this time is different &quot; , &quot; says the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants have made the whole year to a stand@@ ardis@@ ation of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were put to the session of the Federal Open Market Committee during this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could have an increase in this session , the Fut@@ ures trading only gives a chance of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study all decrease @-@ cycles from 1950 to date have taken place in a super cycle with increasing heat at the B@@ IP and on pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ers very quickly after the beginning of recovery in the shadows , &quot; said the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is an absolutely slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months and these have been 74 months .
&quot; fixed in@@ comes was also volati@@ le in the market as the market takes place in place , and the pattern is quite similar as in the capital market . &quot;
&quot; the main difference is that the effect at bonds is faster than with shares , if they change their strategic course . &quot;
bonds seem to change the ren@@ ditions for the first increase / reduction in the cycle .
at the end of the cre@@ asing cycle the attachment will fall immediately and said the Deutsche Bank .
the strateg@@ ist by Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in the interest rates will result in bringing together ren@@ ces between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a down@@ turn of the curve .
&quot; bonds often result in such a climate better income , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yiel@@ ds , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st with Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interesting is , Jones means that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the star@@ tion of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adapted to more str@@ ingent policy views . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest has increased , the earnings is more fl@@ atter , cre@@ dit@@ ches have increased and the volati@@ lity is increased - all characteristics of the market , if the F@@ ed reinfor@@ ces its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and entire companies , companies that get involved in the greater part of their business activities in the USA , can benefit from interest rates and become more attractive . &quot;
multinational companies with high debts are becoming worse since a rising dollar made its products more expensive on the global market and also financing their debts .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; will tend to react very positively three months after an initial grade , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s an@@ alysts in a report for the Client . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded companies with a strong balance sheet after each of the income deposits in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points . &quot;
companies with high capital sales and low volumes in their shares also met their counter@@ parts by an average 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates are losing the most , &quot; said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside of pure stock festivals , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollars . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Depos@@ itors could see gains through higher yiel@@ ds , even if experts are of different opinion , how fast it will take place . &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM &quot; says a member of the Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; the conserv@@ atives member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the radio station because of its &quot; &quot; du@@ v@@ ature &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly difficult to distinguish between commercial ri@@ vals .
he also pointed out the BBC Music Awards and he said that only The Br@@ its has been im@@ itated .
Dam@@ ien Collins &apos; Con@@ duc@@ ts &apos; and said The Voice &apos; and said that this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , claiming a leading member of the board and it increases new pressure on the transmitter , to prove that he does not do something that does not . &quot;
&quot; the conserv@@ atives of Andrew B@@ ingham was also saying the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses , that the public @-@ legal radio receiver &quot; &quot; silly &quot; &quot; and is no longer distingu@@ is@@ hable from its commercial competition . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t use the word &quot; &quot; silly &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot;
&quot; he also worked on the BBC Music Awards , which started in December . &quot;
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , The Br@@ its seem to be just under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples , with which you only im@@ itate the im@@ itate what is already on the market &quot; , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
&quot; BBC @-@ General Director rejected the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is ahead of its commercial ri@@ vals , when it comes to live music and to the public . &quot;
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , that &apos;s what I will learn from classical music anywhere else . &quot;
&quot; and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is really uns@@ ur@@ passed . &quot;
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to put new works on behalf , I also consider important . &quot;
at the beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey said to be harder to work with the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed of classical music .
&quot; radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , while having consul@@ ted the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sports for taking it under fire to tre@@ ad commercial ri@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ory Euro MP Dam@@ ien Collins With The Voice on - The musical talent show , by the BBC , produced by the Dutch manufacturer Tal@@ pa Media for estimated cost of 22 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; see why this program is often discussed , because it isn &apos;t original and not especially distinctive ? &quot;
&quot; Lord Hall consisted of the fact that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - &quot; &quot; was produced in a special BBC &quot; way . &quot;
&quot; he added that he wishes to find the company &quot; a hit from our in @-@ house barn , &quot; when the next time it came to a series of entertainment . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from further rows of The Voice in the future or to give money of the agent for other entertainment formats . &quot;
internet revenue went up in August at the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for this purpose .
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online selling .
last month there was the lowest result since the start of records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using cell@@ phones for shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has checked the expenditure .
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shop has dri@@ lled , and many of Great Britain &apos;s main shopping mile have turned into gh@@ ost towns . &quot;
&quot; experts say that there are signs now that the on @-@ line changes are stagn@@ ant , after new numbers had only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
the total expenditure on August represents the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the year 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ant after new numbers had to be only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the years and see up to 2000 , it has always been developing in the course of time , &quot; Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sale . &quot;
&quot; he explained that the on @-@ line sales increased by three years ago , as a buyer , with their mobile phone purchases . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , for example at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now this ac@@ ri@@ ms down , and we might possibly experience that growth decreases . &quot;
&quot; the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America , is quoted as a reason for the coming paragrap@@ hs . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that buyers have their purchases in advance of this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers to get their computer to their bar@@ gains , and some dealers turn off . &quot;
&quot; experts think that Black Friday , in which the buyers were opposed to bar@@ gains , which could hold buyers from it to sh@@ opp@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium , found that from £ 5 spending a little over 1 £ online was spent . &quot;
in some products such as TV and washing machines are more than one third of the purchases now available on web @-@ shops .
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online rather than in the indoor cities . &quot;
Muslims buried the in Mecca at crane accident driving - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims , among the first funer@@ als in Mecca . &quot;
Saudi Arabia put the breakdown in part of the huge su@@ dic bin Laden @-@ group
&quot; Ministry of Health said that in total 3@@ 94 people were injured , after the crane over@@ threw &quot;
&quot; hundreds of Muslims were gathered together , when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the depths that were killed , as a crane to Mek@@ kas Grand mo@@ g . &quot;
&quot; crowded , mostly in white dressed , the circuit , in order to gain its respect , as the first of the dead came up their last trip to Al @-@ Mo@@ ga@@ la@@ isse@@ &apos;s cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the funer@@ al proc@@ ession passed by the sacred site , where only days before a tree crown was passed through the veil of the mosque and then on the beds . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for burial , when the Saudi King over the construction company of the Bin Laden was due to the catastrophe , which struck also 3@@ 94 injured , a punishment . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 Be@@ ans who were killed as a crane were killed by the Great Central @-@ mosque Mek@@ kas , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead there was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who had been on his first pilgrimage to the crane . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officers have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch continues to Mecca with thousands who continue to come to the city . &quot;
&quot; today , King Salman , the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group would not have had the arm of the crane , as he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arabic version of the decre@@ e that was published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said Bin Laden @-@ Laden was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency reported this detail , but said that the company &apos;s leadership must travel abroad . &quot;
&quot; Salman moved to Salman of what the overthrow of the Cran@@ e caused the fall into a patio of the Groß@@ o@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Moslems were taking place in front of the H@@ add@@ ling who will later participate in this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ Group has not published any statements about the collapse of the Cran@@ e , and their representatives were not available for an opinion . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree was also bl@@ amed for the group because of not current security measures and because it does not co@@ operates with meteor@@ ologist .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ kas Grand mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction run by the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ Group .
the bin Laden has been linked to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over larger projects .
&quot; al Qaeda , the late guide of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a back@@ sliding son which was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in 1990 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , just a few days before arrival of millions in the kingdom for pilgrimage , who is at least once required in the life of every healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said that 158 people are staying in the hospital .
&quot; government representatives signi@@ fy that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to pay for the members of the ghetto and the same sum is permanent . &quot;
others received the amount of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European arti@@ sans is over
&quot; British increasingly occupied arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot;
the number of qualified professionals from Eastern Europe has rise behind them
&quot; this means that 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which aim to deal with tra@@ des@@ men , will be opened up &quot;
King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q out@@ lets are joined country@@ wide at the same time
&quot; Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chief @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail &quot;
&quot; it is alleged that British carry out their hammer and brush in favour of the deployment of qualified Eastern European tra@@ des@@ men who carry out working in their homes , &quot;
if you are sk@@ ill@@ fully able to get around with a hammer or a brush for the range of walls . these days you appear to be a minority .
&quot; as British increasingly employ craftsmen , to carry down jobs in their homes , according to the leader of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Véronique De ry , new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the construction markets , said that a big increase in the number of qualified professionals from Eastern Europe who offer services to over@@ pass is now over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ fis@@ her , 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix shops have plans to open up , which are aimed at craftsmen and 60 out@@ lets of B &amp; Q . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q @-@ Shops ; because eight out of ten purchase orders in the store are met by women .
at the moment he out@@ weigh the men .
&quot; she said , it was necessary to face the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single households that carry more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men in our stores .
we have to shift this stronger into balance .
&quot; in principle , half of our customers come from women with 80 percent of decisions on buying products by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry who is one of only five women at the head of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index and has also struc@@ ted her top team to reflect the equal number of men and women in executive positions .
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial centre . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervis@@ ory board .
King@@ fis@@ her posted a fall in the half @-@ year profit and the sales volume after the Group deb@@ ited the costs of the closing of the shops .
&quot; because of the trend of King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q has to open up to 200 new stores . &quot;
function@@ aries from A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity at the court
&quot; on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball , Vice @-@ magazine A@@ ich / D@@ ob must have had responsibility for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and disp@@ ense . &quot;
the Acc@@ used were not known to blame .
one of them was also charged with his colleagues .
he has been spoken in May right from this accus@@ ation .
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to Col@@ onel General Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary investigation , the def@@ endants had used in 2006 until 2011 funds of club accounts , which they could use in their functions for private purpose , for private purpose . &quot;
&quot; the damage conver@@ ters with about 400@@ ,000 Euros . &quot;
the athletes are also charged with financial regulation .
&quot; this fact divided the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ ler , judge in Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it is said to be a later date .
the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity placed the defense that the club was created at no time a wealth .
&quot; the sport@@ sc@@ ars should have been calculated and took the sports club for which it had worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money in the year 2001 - the Passi@@ va em@@ ru@@ gen in 2001 about 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( rd . 4@@ 4,000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; back then , we stood in front of the situation : do we carry out the club or do we shut up ? &quot; , &quot; said one of the accused , in the language of the language of the financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants , he then decided to take on this task . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; we have money advanced to our livel@@ ih@@ oods as security at the bench , &quot; &quot; he said in receiving . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed upon : you can manage the money freely , it can only be done by debts . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it was brought up by 1991 with the financial and financial success being brought back after 1991 . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , one first took a part of the mut@@ ations up only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus had been on the bank account . &quot;
&quot; thus also l@@ ump and not detail @-@ bookings , even the former Ob@@ man explained the occur@@ ren@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and sub@@ routines managed by the two def@@ endants in common , said the second def@@ endant . &quot;
why the pay@@ outs of the association were not dis@@ closed in detail asked the judge .
&quot; the association has not been interested in detail for financial expenditure , especially if the freedom of school was important , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; as a year 2011 against the one function@@ ary investig@@ ator started , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros has been paid to the association account . &quot;
that had been res@@ tra@@ ded , said the accused . &quot;
&quot; this securities run were upon the name of the second def@@ endants , and according to whose statement the association did not know . &quot;
&quot; why ? , &quot; wanted to know the judge . &quot;
&quot; there@@ for , the respon@@ dent knew no answer . &quot;
&quot; then , he said , he believed that this was the best thing for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something happened to him , no one would have known anything from that money , the pro@@ secutor introduced into the room . &quot;
the accused was informed of been fully @-@ directed by the function@@ aries .
this transfer was formulated as &quot; compensation . &quot;
&quot; claims to harm ? , wanted to know judge and pro@@ secutor . &quot;
&quot; the first accused , he did not agree with this wording as if the association had never been a defect . &quot;
&quot; but what shall I do if the Ad@@ voc@@ ate says , &quot; &quot; You are all from the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the Func@@ tion@@ er , he never referred to a cent salary , it merely calcul@@ ates o@@ dom@@ eter and diets . &quot;
&quot; but it was charged with the society 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort has been much higher however , he added . &quot;
exact documents for the early years were not able to demonstrate the accused .
&quot; these were according to a operation , in which everything had been judged as correctly , were no longer preserved , and they declared . &quot;
o@@ dom@@ eter also referred to the second def@@ endant .
&quot; should all be made in cash , from his residence to the bank at Blei@@ burg , he declared in his statement . &quot;
the main trial will be continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard st@@ alls additional 30.000 jobs
&quot; additionally , for three years of current human resource extraction , the Compu@@ terri@@ ese becomes replaced in the division of the company further jobs . &quot;
the Stell@@ str@@ ations at the US @-@ Compu@@ te He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) will not find an end .
&quot; the US technology company plans to reduce the mining of 25,000 to 30,000 locations in its company . &quot;
&quot; this means that the company should be saved to USD 2,@@ 7 billion ( USD 2,@@ 4 billion ) , the company divided on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special load of around 2,@@ 7 billion dollars , which will fall from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the mining of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed . &quot;
&quot; HP used the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 still around 30@@ 2,000 employees . &quot;
follow @-@ stock was 2.3 percent to the He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ shares 2.3 percent .
&quot; with a large @-@ scale production company from the California Palo Alto , the computer and printing business will be bund@@ led again in a new society - apart from the future advanced areas with computer servers and data store for companies as well as other services . &quot;
both sub@@ missions are to be noted on the stock market .
a further disappointing PC paragraph as well as a weaker demand of corporate clients according to his services set the world &apos;s largest PC @-@ manufacturer after Len@@ ovo at last .
in the third quarter of July the sales volume of PC and printers rose by 11.@@ 5 percent in the third quarter of July .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
the proceeds will be returned in 15 of 16 quarters .
HP answers with an up@@ scale and massive foot@@ age to change in the industry .
&quot; the 76 year old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has re@@ acted shortly afterwards , that customers will buy smart phones and tablets instead of conventional computers and have more and more business done online . &quot;
&quot; Whit@@ mans Rest@@ ruc@@ turing will see a total reduction of around 5@@ 5,000 jobs . &quot;
conflicts : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; but a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would mainly come up with rejection : 54 per cent , in contrast , 35 percent were clearly concerned . &quot;
&quot; that other states plan air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent are positive . &quot;
24 percent are against conflict in the conflict .
&quot; a collaboration with Syria &apos;s Mach@@ th@@ om@@ al Bashar al @-@ Assad rests as per cent of the respon@@ dents , 20 per cent of it . &quot;

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : non@@ violence at the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police held the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and sa@@ vers for several hundred twenty @-@ established refugees .
Eur@@ one@@ ws @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of the border controversial point .
he told us :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it a police force was formed and behind the polic@@ emen was a water light ready .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees were started with stones , sticks and plastic bottles according to the officials . &quot;
the officials were initially un@@ interrupted &quot; &quot; pepper &quot; . &quot; &quot;
then the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
much Tr@@ än@@ sen was praised in the direction of the refugees .
&quot; thus , the group was dis@@ b@@ anded . &quot;
the refugees have now withdrawn a little bit away .
a pregnant and apparently the last woman was carried away from the zone .
&quot; children , who met the trou@@ gh , scre@@ amed . &quot;

time of decision on interest rates for the US @-@ emergency bank
&quot; the world has been observed if the U.S. Department is coming together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time a decade of interest is raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by 80 econom@@ ists who were asked of Reu@@ ters found out that a little over half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will continue to last a little longer and exc@@ eeds the interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot;
it is a historical event because it is seven years since the F@@ ed Price on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a big central bank may leave the zero @-@ branch and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Head of Staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is based on a relatively good power level , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ sive views of global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to act on an increase , but the signs point out that the chances of having such a step are good . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 AM CE@@ T on Thursday
de@@ ple@@ ting at the Delta State University made exc@@ uses exc@@ itation
&quot; after the shoot and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on the Monday morning - and before he fired his colleagues on the day - Sh@@ annon Lamb &apos;s a note in order to say that he was sorry &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; in the first murder and wanted it , &quot; &quot; he could make it happen &quot; , &quot; gave authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that Lamb , lectur@@ er for Ge@@ ography and Social education at the Delta State University , announced the emergency number at 10 : 00 am Monday morning . &quot;
and said he had shot on someone and killed someone .
Lamb said to the staff at the emergency centre that police officers must be issu@@ ing at his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I enjoyed my wife yesterday evening , &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , but no one will distur@@ b &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not deliver him . &quot;
Lamb was not an explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police came to the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry I could . &quot;
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me .
&quot; after writing the note he was 300 miles to Delta State University , where he won E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killed before he finally took his own life on Monday , when poli@@ cem@@ an experienced him . &quot;
&quot; university President William La@@ For@@ ge said , he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot;
&quot; despite reports written on Monday , he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; of a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ inde@@ er was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who chan@@ ts that they were married about seven years , as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but they remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have had one daughter , which is 19 , and they should be destroyed . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were his daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , after statement of L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said , he had sum@@ mon@@ ed it to a certain point on Monday in order to say to them &quot; &quot; he &apos;s not in prison . &quot;
&quot; police officers took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville in that night , he drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the woods and sle@@ w himself with a shot . &quot;
Lamb was held in early 2015 by the Delta State University a doctoral position like his life at the University of University .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
the Lufthansa is planning a large concert structure .
half a billion euros a year that the Lufthansa company is saving alone with a better organization .
&quot; 150 of the worldwide around 1,000 executives will cost firms working at the workplace . &quot;
&quot; with the pilot &apos;s trade union , there will be negotiations for the new negotiation . &quot;
the Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and values the cheap price of Euro@@ wings .
&quot; the goal of the real@@ ign@@ ment was a result of about 500 million Euros per year from cost @-@ sol@@ vent , divided the airline on Wednesday . &quot;
among other things the Lufthansa is not a member of the board for the passenger business in the future .
the current g@@ hi@@ g@@ uni@@ y Euro@@ wings should invest in an independent way as possible .
in the preliminary team CEO Carsten Masch@@ hr will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in the future .
&quot; the resolution also under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and easy@@ Jet . &quot;
&quot; so far , the organisation of the 120 1,000 employees has been complex . &quot;
the airlines are situated below the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group that represents three quarters of an annual turnover of 30 billion euros .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can not play for months due to double @-@ performance
&quot; Luke Sha@@ w suffered from the Champions League &apos;s defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven a double , correction of his right one . &quot;
&quot; while this brought the left foreign defence to wines and exclude him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al won &apos;t hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
the injury was created by a consider@@ ate attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was broken in the PS@@ V region .
he was treated for nine minutes in the field and needed oxygen before he was transferred to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double bass player and is located in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; he will be moved by tomorrow or maybe one day later , and then has operated in Manchester . &quot;
&quot; it is terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United in the age of 18 , it is very difficult and then fantastic , and then that happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had a level of oxygen .
he cried .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double correction , then it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
&quot; Moreno seems to be happy , a Red card and the im@@ position of a El@@ f@@ meter . &quot;
&quot; Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ er , has not punished the Mex@@ icans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al affirmed that the Italian arbitr@@ ators had not mistaken .
&quot; you can judge for yourself , when I say that a El@@ f@@ meter and a red card was charged . &quot;
it was a very bad attack on both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et on Sha@@ w account was : &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how kap@@ ut my way to recovery begins now , I come back stronger . &quot;
here related : Manchester United facilit@@ ates the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at the PS@@ V
the England advocate has an additional incentive to recover in France with the European Soccer Championship .
&quot; Philli@@ p Co@@ cu , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very aw@@ ful injury . &quot; &quot;
if a player leaves the place with this kind of injury all are very sad about that .
it &apos;s never the intention of any player to viol@@ ate an opponent .
&quot; Moreno suffered a break in , when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al Holland team at the World Cup 2014 . &quot;
&quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and when you hear that it is a very bad injury , is that not good , &quot; said Co@@ cu . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball who was travelling in another direction was , so it looked , as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Moreno &quot; &quot; I know how it feels like it feels I know how hard it could be . &quot;
I feel very badly with me . I am so tired .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a fin@@ oul@@ ame of Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron met The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is a thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child does a book , it will not take long until you know it almost pro@@ dig@@ al . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favorite children &apos;s book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax was decided by Dr. Se@@ uss in 1971 . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; fun , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , because it always seems to have missed a picture or a message that we have so far missed . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron already describes the action of the book , instead reminis@@ cent of the movie release of 2012 that added new characters and details to expand the fairly short origin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Au@@ dre@@ y , to see the girl of his dreams , accompl@@ ishing the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss @-@ Geis@@ el and the 1991 died , however completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if this were not too suspect enough : the text presented by Cameron presented itself partially like the summary of the player &apos;s Lor@@ ax film , which is produced on the website of the Internet Movie Database , and so begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where it is artificial and even the air is a commodity , to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; even though He resi@@ des to be a prag@@ matic Father , it seems impro@@ bable that Cameron does not trust the action of the book so little . here is an un@@ named boy , as the local environment speaks through the yel@@ low@@ ly , trees fold , th@@ ru@@ sive , snor@@ ing beings who speak in the name of the trees . &quot;
possibly such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to an hel@@ per who did not have read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times a child .
&quot; a down@@ ing Street @-@ spokes@@ woman said , that the text was probably come from Cam@@ er@@ on elec@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text of Cam@@ er@@ on &apos;s employees has been delivered , but were no further direct comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened from the exclusion from England , but it is still hard &quot;
&quot; across Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but if you chose the Ka@@ der , the England for the tour , is a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series , not on my map . &quot;
I would not exclude an upward victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page is possibly less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Batt@@ ing of the Batt@@ ing and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; the ball developed to move Mo@@ een Ali as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it is an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
application @-@ related news : Adam Ly@@ th consists of the England @-@ Test Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to go to Adam Ly@@ th is of course to be seen as his principal trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyze . &quot;
&quot; at its seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ e@@ player are oriented on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark by Joe Root , for example , and this led to nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players have their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , one had extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
if he hopefully fails to visit Yor@@ k@@ shire has another chance .
&quot; the England trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not make such good performances , and that was not surprising . he &apos;s above all a team @-@ man . &quot;
&quot; the question of how much time will get a test percus@@ sion@@ mann , in order to place his character is difficult . &quot;
&quot; Ly@@ th has got seven opportunities - like Sam Rob@@ son before him , while Nick was then nine . &quot;
&quot; only Comp@@ ton , there was a chance for home and down@@ ward . &quot;
the only repro@@ ach that can be raised that England first came Jonathan in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a hammer that I treasure high .
he is an X @-@ Factor @-@ cri@@ ck@@ et@@ player that we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he reached 2@@ 36 votes against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge .
&quot; it must obtain at least the same chances as those before him , but of course it depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; let the idea to strike Mo@@ een besides Cook , which at an extra @-@ spin @-@ bow@@ ler could furn@@ ish and four qu@@ icks are preserved , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
I don &apos;t see why a b@@ ats@@ man cannot beat there ; and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a devil @-@ sk@@ er@@ l of cri@@ cket players .
&quot; Mo@@ een might have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
&quot; my earlier te@@ amm@@ ate Justin Lan@@ ger has played on his first 38 tests in the first drop , before it was opening as an op@@ ener . &quot;
he gave three hundred chari@@ ots away and looked back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes to the Ka@@ der as Back @-@ up Sp@@ inner and in my limited way of dealing with him he has impressed me as a young man .
&quot; guys may see themselves his st@@ ats - on average 31 with the r@@ ack@@ et and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a st@@ unt , but there is no large numbers of backup layers who raise their hands and the trainers have decided on youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made a few wise additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Mat@@ awar@@ ding , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; it is one of the nicest guys in the game , which will bring an abundance of experiences since it has played under all conditions and against all the attacks . &quot;
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and powerful deployment into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket contest , as a player or as a coach , and as Mah@@ ela did he insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices in the locker room could bring fresh air , even if the news is in line with the previously predicted . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ l@@ ys team @-@ mates at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , Root received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and te@@ amm@@ ate do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as in the players depend on their jobs on the results .
such decisions are made not made light .
the Bre@@ xit ( Bre@@ xit = Aus@@ l@@ ure of Britain from the EU ) could be gained in grants when the economy is up to 2017 through a thread
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s in@@ action strategy to hold Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with each day , even without the voting of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is there yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C to viol@@ ently against Europe for Europe . &quot;
foreigners also have their i@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .

&quot; in Brighton , the TU@@ C chose the TU@@ C at its annual meeting to risk the social protection against the social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister are climbing on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , making a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they allies and reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wishes a coming @-@ looking UK outside of the EU &apos;s tent - &quot; &quot; let us know not alone with France &quot; , &quot; says Berlin - and I can see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials came up to the point on which it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel has allies , but she has been in power for 10 years now and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her as it looks at the exagger@@ ation of events such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande looks back on his re@@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading power .
&quot; Poland possibly quickly have a nationalist right government , Spain a left @-@ wing one . &quot;
it is difficult to imagine that they will tear the leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British whose energy should be better employed in Scotland &apos;s withdrawal from the UK - something that they do not want because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
&quot; therefore , some such ministers are even deliberately not helpful comments , quite in the SN@@ P style , during the SN@@ P @-@ style in 2017 , to speed up the Bre@@ xit process , expect my boyfriend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a ple@@ th@@ ite , and &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Europeans know how predat@@ ory Street is at its expense , and which EU scep@@ tics has been the oligar@@ chy of the press bar@@ one , as they were not supported by Tony Ben@@ n @-@ inspired referendum in 1975 but did not support our entry to 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ euro opportun@@ ists , who made themselves a name as an &quot; EU straight &quot; Ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; with all his cra@@ z@@ iness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; these also include the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ stran@@ g@@ ents , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ acking agents and the pseudo @-@ lands , who own most of our major newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought similar over her , but found that if you sit with a hot Gor@@ illa on a cage , it was distributed better ban@@ anas to distr@@ act him instead of being at lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band used more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans as Bla@@ ir himself as he refused to dism@@ iss Cam@@ er@@ ons referendum , because Bla@@ ir had rejected the principle of the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened him an backdoor . &quot;
the press has never tried it away .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ bi@@ n that gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on his back on Monday - I said to him that he doesn &apos;t have time to repeat for me - seems at risk the Neil Kin@@ no@@ ck Boy@@ k@@ ott Mur@@ a strategy of the 80 @-@ s years to repeat a mistake at that time and nowadays .
&quot; it may take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy in order to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC &apos;s sofa has left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ling &apos;s official position for Europe is - I just press it out nicely - in the development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff Tenden@@ cy and wild beasts of Tor@@ ry Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can certainly say yes to everyone . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ es &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week , said than the path@@ finder in him , did not admit that Cor@@ bi@@ ns appointment of the prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Don@@ nell as a sha@@ d@@ gun is a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s , as his old father wanted to show himself on TV to go loyal towards his Labour Party , without going too far and losing his cabinet time . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was still more attractive .
&quot; but to fight in &quot; &quot; to stay under any circumstances &quot; &quot; - B@@ enn@@ s term - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , nor was J@@ C included his comrades @-@ arms and MEPs according to all reports on the Monday evening . &quot;
whatever the touching Bot@@ tom @-@ Up image of Cor@@ by@@ n - remember that he even stir@@ red me - News Dis@@ cipl@@ ine remains important in the age of television around the clock and above all in the Stru@@ ctu@@ le of Social Media , a breeding ground of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is correct to give Cameron any free ticket for Europe who allows him to keep lab@@ ours assistance in the dum@@ my campaign for a matter of course , such as Mc@@ Don@@ nell said it . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks that .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ bi@@ ns &apos;s fundamental relationship on EU membership - in line with its state @-@ level discussion , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic dispute . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C will not start a campaign for res@@ ign@@ ation , foreign diplom@@ ats will be oblig@@ ated to try , in all a sense of their superi@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; why should Paris or Berlin apply political capital , they also have mis@@ fuels - to make conc@@ essions to the British when all of this can be meaning@@ less ? &quot;
&quot; the US has already been quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even having an under@@ steering of the T@@ ory government in power , which was reminded on Monday of Monday which was mentioned by British Influ@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts cri@@ tici@@ ze report by Public Health England via e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partially with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , introduces the Lanc@@ et to critic@@ ise the evidence by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes . &quot;
he published the &quot; Annual Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , some researchers have ques@@ tioned the tough@@ ness of the data and instruc@@ ted to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
a editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month was attacked by the &quot; extremely wind@@ y basis &quot; on the p@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
two more researchers write for BM@@ I and asked whether the claims &quot; on stone or sand &quot; has been raised .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Works Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public is expected that the claim of p@@ he that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less damaging are based as smoking &quot; on a detailed review of succession and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 persons who were called to develop a model for a multi @-@ line decision @-@ making analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - M@@ C@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage caused by different nicotine to produce a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that one of the meeting &apos;s sponsors was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose general manager was previously received by British American Tob@@ acco Use ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
he also wrote the references from BA@@ T to Public Health in a Sustainability Report ; they said .
&quot; one of the 12 participants in the meeting declared that funding from an e @-@ smoking maker , but not the financing that he should have received according to reports previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the Gre@@ um are not delivered , but also include several known e @-@ cigarettes champi@@ ons , some of which also specify a branch of industry financing in paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in the tobacco control .
at the session also took part in the tobacco direction of p@@ he .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; considers &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of hard evidence of most of the products among most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or limitations in the p@@ he report will be discussed . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers are &quot; &quot; premature . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director for Health and Wellness at P@@ he said , said that the declaration of BM@@ I was previously respon@@ sive to the claims of BM@@ I . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that health risks of e @-@ cigarettes compared to low are low , but that we continue to study the long term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has no requirement to inform the public about what is proof of and not , particularly when there is so much public confusion about the relative danger compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 8@@ 0.000 people die annually at a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health system two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; the clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC was to give up East@@ der , says the former Director of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC would stop giving programmes like East@@ man and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals &quot; would give their right arm &quot; for hit @-@ shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the round@@ trip should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent through other UK channels .
&quot; he cri@@ tici@@ zed the BBC that they will be seen public @-@ legal programs which probably are seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ disputed time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and from the stations such as BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; as the BBC @-@ General Manager , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said that he tried to join us in channel 4 without success for six years . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes were in order or sends , which were clearly shown by not substantial ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus @-@ IT @-@ Committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to hold the round plan , which I do not hold for a good idea in the medium or long term , one should at least set up its production at least on programs that others do not have or commissioned . &quot;
&quot; they send The Voice in a first class window , because they want to achieve a wide range of support for their future as possible . &quot;
&quot; the idea that anyone else would show this is a joke , it is ridiculous , it is of course nonsense . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is being funded and which could also be financed without subsidies .
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ on is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both pro@@ productions . &quot;
be honest the other channels would give their right arm to it .
I ende@@ avor to see how this should be public @-@ right TV .
I don &apos;t think that it would not at all decrease the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , an entre@@ preneur , a businessman , who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC is to blame for reviews , &quot; because of the ambitions of people who work there and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular shows of the BBC announced that , what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , suggested that the BBC shows how East@@ man should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the more public @-@ related N@@ IC programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , but they do not meet their tasks , but they can argue that if they go to their hypo@@ critical missions for the justification of 4 billion £ broad@@ cast@@ ers , &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
&quot; put them in a window window , in which no one ever wanted to see it ever . &quot;
&quot; Mr Johnson said to the committee , &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system with regard to conditions on which to obtain the best value below . &quot;
&quot; of course , remember all , we all think that you get a great value for 150 £ a year , but for people who &apos;s up for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if this is true , because they consume not much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former sky@@ line and channel 5 @-@ chief David El@@ stein , who also asked before the Committee on Tuesday , challenged the BBC to review their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to educate and to enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said that little from BBC &apos;s production would be officially classified as education - he said that it should be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in radio - and it should be taken to the publicly legal television programmes in Australia and Canada .
&quot; to issue the partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC would do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , from which he said that only a handful of television were shown to make alliances all available online . &quot;
&apos; Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells through sound @-@ waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ on change the direction in the moment when broadcast with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have cultivated the worms with gene@@ tically modified nerv@@ ousness systems . they can be controlled by long@@ itu@@ dinal @-@ waves .
&quot; the tiny ne@@ mat@@ odes change the direction in the moment when they with sound impul@@ ses , that have too high frequencies for human hearing , in order to be heard . &quot;
&quot; the impul@@ ses are working through the switching of Mot@@ one@@ ur@@ on cells , which can be gene@@ tically modified in order to bear the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound . &quot;
another topic of topic : researchers read and write brain @-@ activity with light
&quot; researchers said the worms expressed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ genetics , where an ultrasound is used to enable a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside of the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ bren@@ an@@ th Chal@@ de@@ ani , researchers at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could stimulation the depths of brain drug , an invasive procedure , the electrical conduc@@ tivity in the brain of human symptoms to treat Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; f@@ lim@@ mer@@ worms are usually not responding to ultrasound , but Chal@@ de@@ ani notes that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scop@@ ic bubbles . &quot;
&quot; b@@ lowjob , he found out , strengthen the ultrasound @-@ waves , that penetr@@ ate into the worms . &quot;
&quot; the reinforced ultras@@ onic waves work on structures , called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and can be found in the membran@@ es from some of the dig@@ nit@@ ary cells . &quot;
&quot; the acousti@@ cs effect the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells in which they are associated , so a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultrasound @-@ controlled ne@@ ato@@ genic , Chal@@ de@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the worms so many of their Mot@@ one@@ ur@@ one TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when it turns ultrasound to the changed creatures , the wave @-@ waves are enhanced by the micro@@ blo@@ ws and transferred to the worms , where they turn the altered Mot@@ one@@ ur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the process has some similarities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a tra@@ il@@ bla@@ zing tool that enables researchers to come up and switch the neur@@ ons with stimul@@ i of the light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ bi@@ genetics could have some advantages compared to this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which needs to be revealed in a optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , low @-@ rate ultrasound sub@@ types can happen un@@ inhi@@ bited and so can be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make evidence temporarily to the ultras@@ onic signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student dormit@@ ories
&quot; eleven years ago I began as a self @-@ for@@ got@@ ten@@ ant 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student dormit@@ ory , still remember faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vism , but only now I remember the tense c@@ iles , which I have been angry - and to the numerous , long @-@ voice complaints about others . &quot;
most of the things I &apos;ve learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the train in school residen@@ ces ranges from slightly nerve wre@@ cking up to absolutely scary .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to tie people : people tell where you come from whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ches , where you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you are going to be honest Mar@@ mite , because in my room , guys , it is just a He@@ fe@@ ather &apos;s ha@@ haha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Make questions and show interest .
&quot; it distr@@ acts the conversation and helps you to find out the people that you like in opposition to those with which you would not speak , even when your lashes on fire gro@@ etes and this fire ext@@ ingu@@ ishers . &quot;
allow people .
&quot; the rooms of people are often transformed into beverages , film @-@ night venues and local meetings , but they are also places where people attract and their underwear . &quot;
related to this : do not think about it at the university with one relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted obtained a rough treatment at the University .
&quot; their room should be a sanctuary , but many student dormit@@ ories form a room @-@ to @-@ room @-@ stroll culture that is friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
&quot; this can be hell for someone , trying to relax . &quot;
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship forward , but you have to go away so that I get the energy back I used to interact with you . &quot;
try to feel when a pe@@ ers of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted - and send it an SMS instead of a knock .
A@@ pro@@ pos drop : do it .
another guy in my students had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close through baking .
&quot; since you start the university at the height of the back @-@ mania , the clo@@ cking at the doors of people to imagine traveling with a plate full of brow@@ nies is less awkward as the welcome of 1950 &apos;s years &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have put you a little n@@ elling . so , and now please smile as I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
your roomm@@ ates feel committed to enter@@ tain themselves and will end up your face with a delicious surprise in the end .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent bakery . &quot;
&quot; l@@ umps in flour , sugar and fat will make people sleep sleeping when you drop . &quot;
food to steal is an old crime in student dormit@@ ories .
&quot; of course , the clut@@ ches of chicken is a theft , but is it the take of a drop of milk for your tea also ? &quot;
check it with the Mil@@ ky owner .
&quot; the chances are good that they say to use themselves , even when they cook inside . &quot;
&quot; if anyone ste@@ aling your bel@@ ong@@ ings , this is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as my ten@@ ant who added her milk a pur@@ ge , in order to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es . &quot;
it is now in prison .
they should not make a noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not just about being a decent human being , but that you should belong to the people in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb that sit in the Glass House . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my corridor asked her neighbors , whether it makes them something that makes me drum &apos;n bass somewhat qui@@ eter because it was three in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
it responded with even lou@@ der music .
&quot; when they finally heard at 5 o &apos;clock , they kindly agreed to sleep for two hours before they moved their own music , closed their door and ended up at their three @-@ hour examination . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would enter the same student dormit@@ ory ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , it would not be aby@@ sm@@ al embarrassing if you hold a roomm@@ ate for your future marriage arrangements , to run down again and then experience it every day and maybe along with them , how they put all our common friends around them ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart is his own paths - but if a hot roomm@@ ate is definitely not your future spouse @-@ partner , try at least to conc@@ eive within your abdom@@ en . &quot;
&quot; in the thrilling moment in which you notice that somebody has lost his key in his not locked room , the border between an Ul@@ k and mo@@ bbing occurs when it appears . &quot;
&quot; a good sc@@ oop is fun , but it only takes a moment until it is bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
do not get a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but never miss someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
&quot; close their door , and place their keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but stap@@ ler keep your possessions on the ceiling at no more than twice . &quot;
&quot; town@@ houses for refugees , single travelers , bar@@ ing@@ ear@@ ners &quot;
&quot; the real estate of Markus G@@ ild@@ ner is building in the mid @-@ eastern part of the town@@ houses for people who do not have much money . &quot;
&quot; thus , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need space , but also the only mother and the head of the head . &quot;
&quot; I am showing how one can still build cheap and well @-@ build today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushing for the housing market .
entrepreneurs Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes how quickly a lot of living space can be created : he builds in a project terr@@ aced houses for refugees .
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner : many refugees are waiting for the housing market .
which solution offer you addressed ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because people are staying at a great extent here .
&quot; in view of the refugee zone , we also need sufficient housing in the next decades . &quot;
a completely four @-@ story terr@@ aced house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a town@@ house needs the least place .
it facilit@@ ates integration .
it is different if people are under@@ lining the people of habit@@ ation .
&quot; each of the six houses built especially in the pilot department , consists of three residential units for each four asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a living room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees are saying , it is again peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be easily changed according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is built on 18@@ 4 000 Euro , without plot . &quot;
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
six months before the construction took place .
this is reasonable .
do the construction provisions turn out their plans &quot; complicated ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : I am legally responsible for my project .
particularly complicated it is always the lo@@ oming D@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ he@@ e special building and the stand@@ ardis@@ ation order .
cre@@ epy .
&quot; it will still be under@@ estimated , who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in cities is lacking in the towns .
and refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars .
how did the inhabitants react to their line @-@ up project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who have been accused of creating lux@@ uries for asylum seekers .
what definitely not correct .
but would you not exac@@ erb@@ ated the competitive struggle for paid homes ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : true : the last five years we have built a building boom in Germany , but built luxury apartments that can hardly afford more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the ordinary people need a living space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the alone od@@ ors or the sp@@ ear@@ head . &quot;
I am showing how one can still build it cheap and well in a good way .
this is why it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple @-@ Update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the adju@@ sting app , to &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install it . &quot;
&quot; some are encountered problems after the installation , as they get an error message that fet@@ ched that the &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; is mis@@ placed . &quot;
&quot; to deal with the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the rush is back or trying to update via iTunes . &quot;
the telephone will guides you through the rest of the process .

Dr. Frank Müller to take on practice and is investing € 3@@ 10000
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ting ausen .
&quot; Sam@@ es@@ car@@ meister also deals with Bernd Bor@@ mann , business @-@ promoting in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and As@@ endor@@ sement Mayor Hein@@ berg Kab@@ bert . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country of Doc@@ tors - A@@ endorf on the other hand , however , Dr. Frank Müller to take over practice on 1 October . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ting started reti@@ ring in retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is about to post his successor in the next few months with a half spot . &quot;
&quot; after a re@@ building phase , Müller opens the practice on 12 October until then he is investing € 3@@ 000@@ EUR into the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy for the first sight , when the time standing was met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ at@@ oll , who currently completed their expert knowledge in the &quot; &quot; hospital &quot; &quot; and come into practice as well . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the m@@ iller would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ gh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was ready , I just ph@@ oned it . &quot;
the couple of Müller ar@@ ded the idea to be one of our own practices in future in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years , &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also see his own boss soon . &quot;
and so one was agreed that m@@ iller also bought the house with practice .
they will continue to reside in ten@@ hausen .
&quot; the twin family @-@ owner Frank Müller has also grown up , has followed his medical studies in Hanover as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ k and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he worked as a su@@ preme graduate in Sul@@ ingen , and he was appointed to the leading medical specialist in Di@@ ep@@ wood in 2009 and is involved in the DR@@ K @-@ read@@ ed car@@ bure@@ au . &quot;
&quot; from September 19th , the practice will be prepared for the new boss . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ b@@ inger , he worked as a specialist team , has specialized his wife Ur@@ sel ( boarding ) in the gastro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the m@@ iller , both dormit@@ ists , want to settle down as home doctors . &quot;
&quot; the End@@ os@@ copy is therefore performed , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
after the reconstruction the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultrasound exam@@ inations as well as long @-@ term and loading @-@ EK@@ GS .
&quot; furthermore , the ED@@ V will be completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a grant from a total of 50@@ 000 Euro , the m@@ iller as part of a funding program ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and reli@@ ably we are that practice is continuing to continue &quot; , &quot; emphasises Sam@@ t@@ lement hand@@ y@@ man Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; about 2000 patients come to practice rock @-@ G@@ ong@@ at@@ oll during each quarter at the practice of Fel@@ ting ausen , in the North German average practice , there are about 500 . &quot;
in As@@ endorf there is another general practition@@ er .
a positive side @-@ effect of the practice @-@ work is by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ting ausen in As@@ endorf .
&quot; if no replacement would have found , then it would have gone . &quot;
&quot; the Mü@@ llers Sp@@ ess@@ an visited , by the way he continues to look in intimate faces : to take over the seven medical experts and the cleaning of the rock . &quot;
&quot; with their departure end in As@@ endorf , a era after all , the medical doctors have worked there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lows also rec@@ alls . &quot;
a little sadness appreci@@ able them after the long time .
&quot; but we stay further in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will many patients see it often , &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot;
your husband will be lau@@ ghing : &quot; we have a 6000 m square meter . &quot;
&quot; so far I have always pushed me out of gardening , now it could be different . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the couple has two grandchildren and travels to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees by :
&quot; now the border controls will also be driven on our southern border , &quot; &quot; said Minister of Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain erect .
&quot; still it is clear that everyone who wants to make an asylum , this can also &quot; &quot; of course &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the safety and safety of people are par@@ amount .
&quot; but it is clear that there must be clear signals , &quot; the government said . &quot;
people have to know that we do not accept limit@@ less migration flows but also not over the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia indic@@ ted &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to travel loyal refugees toward Austria and Germany and under certain circumstances continue to establish cor@@ ridors for the refugees .
&quot; this was the Minister of Culture in Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ ridors is absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia is rather the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary - intensi@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the border with Croatia is considered to be the outside of the Schengen area , however already strongly controlled . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister of Agriculture said , Slovenia wants to do its borders for refugees but not . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; he stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government was postpon@@ ed , the first refugees had already tried to go to the night in the night @-@ hours , in East Croatian at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to pass to the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could resort it in the near corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik was continually meeting police vehicles with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it was primarily about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross have already been implemented in action .
&quot; in the years to come , his country with approximately 4000 refugees , said the Minister of Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , buses from Pres@@ evo would be transferred to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border to Croatia that far has brought migrants to the Hungarian border , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the government in Belgrade , however , that it may be the people to suggest certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do it , &quot; name meant . &quot;
&quot; according to the media report , the first bus was expected to arrive at the Serbian border with around 50 refugees in the Serbian border town S@@ id where other buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; from Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the passengers were on the way around the entire night from the approximately 500 kilometres away to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border by Serbia .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has added , so the police said that we are supposed to drive there , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
thus it could actually move into a somewhat further west side by observers already as a result of the former Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west located .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive ways to limit control &quot;
&quot; Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country was prepared for the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees , appropriate plans for possible conditions . &quot;
&quot; he did not call him , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member states : &quot;
we conduct strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of the EU member since 2007 , and the EU has since gone through a good testimony to the standard of border inspec@@ tions . &quot;
on the bass side behind the Hungarian border @-@ fence it continues to be about 300 refugees .
&quot; according to the report of the media report , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , who will lead to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities the two border crossing , Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remains completely blocked . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees would now wish to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
&quot; the Serbian &quot; Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to rest on Wednesday morning at a local branch in Hor@@ gos : in order to stop the debate on altern@@ ate routes from refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature . &quot;
it would not be at present a very high level of refugees .
&quot; it could not be said whether they would continue their journey to Hungary , Croatia or any other country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants on - dangerous and alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee camps has already begun to distribute the refugees maps that offer alternative routes to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border region there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian Parliament not yet cleared min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police reported that a team of mine clear@@ ance was sent to the border region .

&quot; with the exploited information , in@@ sider @-@ shops are meant to be made on the financial markets . &quot;
in this way the investig@@ ators were reported to have received more than 100 million dollars .

the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ ic@@ os responded to their 20 @-@ year anniversary with this action and is quite faced with mixed reactions .
&quot; it &apos;s all about life , so we talked with the action in the middle of the city and among men , &quot; says Jose@@ fine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ it@@ ri supports the pas@@ sers @-@ by as well as questions and discussions at hand as the volunteer staff .
&quot; while some fits spontaneously to the chal@@ k and watched the sentence around &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; to stop &quot; &quot; stopping the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; not long &quot; , &quot; let them read , say propositions like &quot; &quot; I am not yet &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again on the ver@@ ge there are small discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying . &quot;
Peter Hü@@ b@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; only if I make clear to me that one day comes to the end of this world , I can embrace master@@ fully , &quot; says the director of the Diak@@ onischen Werkes Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ sion@@ ists of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ ic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public awareness campaign is good for 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; but that not everyone knows it publicly available in the tablets , it is understandable , after all it was a very personal matter . &quot;
&quot; death and death was still hairy , as the experience of Jose@@ fo@@ e Lam@@ mer , although the Hosp@@ ice &apos; movement in recent years contributed a lot to the fact that people open up . &quot;

the eu@@ than@@ ised and funer@@ al companion is one of the volunteers &apos; hon@@ orary staff of the first hour .
&quot; through personal experience with the theme faced , they read a lot of literature and decided to engage in eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; as the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ ic@@ ep@@ ics requested by the call , they immediately reported and was part of it in the year 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ li@@ roid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and families in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and hosp@@ ice hosp@@ it@@ aria . &quot;
all are they carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ li@@ roid can handle well with her job and experience about experience and experiences .
&quot; I see life from another war@@ te , hold it for precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; says it . &quot;
the offer of out@@ patient E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ ice is free and denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insur@@ ers and donations of relatives and associations enables training as well as training and skills of mortal and funer@@ al purposes .
all two years of training are offered training courses for new employees .

F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed with finance @-@ prospects for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appointments for the last quarter and the song @-@ gi@@ li@@ ant lower@@ ed his prize @-@ looking at a whole year because of the weak@@ est demand for freight services and higher costs in their bo@@ d@@ owing service .
&quot; the company also said that she is planning to earn around 5,@@ 5,000 off the season for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; this time last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set up 50,000 employees for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell more than 2.5 per cent in the pre@@ market @-@ trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. An@@ no@@ un@@ ces Trans@@ action to earn a win between 10,@@ 40 and 10,@@ 90 for the financial year that ends in the next May , 20 cents less than in the previous forecast . &quot;
an@@ alysts expected according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; the lower view is expected in spite of the price increases , which will rise by 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and despite greater exposure to Bod@@ men from heavy and large packages , which will be charged from November onwards . &quot;
&quot; the company said that it would also expect the result compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher income and due to growth in online retail . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will generate solid revenue even when it is weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than that of the Rival U@@ PS , who plans to stop 9@@ ,000 to 9@@ ,000 extra workforce , such as the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the first quarter of August which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million earned a total of $ , 6 percent more than last year . &quot;
&quot; the result per share stood at $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research spec@@ alysts . &quot;

F@@ ed@@ Ex has left a decline in international Pri@@ ority shipping in recent years that has launched its sales in its unity at express delivery .
but the boom in online @-@ shopping has increased the results with F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; the sales increased in the last quarter increased by 29 percent in the last quarter , but the operational result was basically flat due to higher cost of greater packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express @-@ Unit made higher revenue due to higher prices , whereas the result fell due to higher labour costs in the cargo business . &quot;
&quot; in the pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares rose by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ . &quot;

&quot; and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too close to them to pre@@ dict them . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned by the unprecedented stimul@@ ant , ending to zero @-@ short term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most of the data on the economy pres@@ upp@@ oses that it grows solid , the recent turmo@@ il in the global financial markets make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to strengthen these volati@@ lity because of the lifting of the interest to federal loans - and be it just a quarter of the percentage . &quot;
&quot; obviously the employment market and inflation must first be the most important thing to observe , &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief Econom@@ ist in the Mak@@ ler@@ y Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think when looking for an excuse to increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is getting enough right to keep , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do is secur@@ es itself on the financial market itself .
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists who have recently been asked by Bloom@@ berg , have predicted this week . &quot;
&quot; markets , however , are expecting a with@@ ering of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator which indicates a 30 % chance of raising an increase . &quot;
&quot; this points to a decline in the stock market in case the F@@ ed raises the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ist ab@@ ide the blow by promising a further increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage score was 22@@ 8.@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed politics kept the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief United Nations with Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would withdraw the sets at that time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does so , she would have to go very far in their statement to re@@ assure the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic into panic . &quot;
other experts argued that a tax evasion would appe@@ ase the financial markets because they would eliminate in@@ security when the F@@ ed will act .
&quot; prior to a month the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to raise the sentence around 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow shar@@ pen@@ ing of mon@@ ary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; in spring and early summer , Y@@ elles had said that this year it would be necessary despite the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required , an increase of the proposition . &quot;
&quot; though the creation of jobs in August has slow@@ ed , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate dropped to 5,@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the levels which the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage @-@ boo@@ sts have seen signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly au@@ ded under the annual goal of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of much lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and it needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian She@@ pher@@ dson , Con@@ feder@@ ations with Pan@@ theon Macro@@ economics . &quot;
&quot; but the financial markets around the world ended up late last month , after exporting their currency . &quot;
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage fell more than 16 % below its peak , when investors were afraid that the slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would weak@@ en the global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered in this month , the Dow is now at almost 10 % below the high rate of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market upheav@@ als affect the complex calcul@@ ating , when the interest should be increased . &quot;
&quot; if the events in the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy has not appeared in the last few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the US Not@@ en@@ bench . &quot;
&quot; now he predic@@ ts that they are waiting at least a month to get the effect better into the handle .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on U.S. economy , and there is almost no reliable data that will describe developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is none of the major centres of the F@@ ed , so they should not be involved in their decision @-@ making process . &quot;
but in the end effect the F@@ ed Monetary Office has become the world .
the central bank of the central bank was enormous over the last few years .
&quot; the mere reference of the former Leit@@ ers Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could be confined to its monetary policy &quot; &quot; narrow &quot; &quot; con@@ fu@@ sions around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to not only monitor the developments in other sites but also with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; its decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noticed this month , that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of superi@@ ority on financial market movements that apparently cannot be linked with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; L@@ acker , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , committed to a promotion of interests , organised decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its benchmark interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite limiting its effects on growth in the U.S. , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representatives were presenting these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should set out aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the quar@@ ry in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the interest of the Bank of England . &quot;
the recent turmo@@ il do not come close to this level ; he said .
&quot; you certainly don &apos;t want to get into the situation in which they fear a hole , because the markets are upright , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act continues to include a double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is altered , I do not think it should take time . &quot;

Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tries to clear up women how important good nutrition during the breastfeeding period is . this is done with the presentation of images of babies who are painted on br@@ ist@@ ling acid with representations of un@@ healthy foods .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that provide babies to all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; because of the extra energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that healthy diet fluctu@@ ations in fact affects the genetics of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ors . &quot;
unfortunately an unhealthy diet of the child can influence the immune system negative .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ wars of the Spor@@ ts@@ hall
the district of Bern@@ ried approved the building request for the 2.3 million Euros in the expensive sport hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar panels .
the plans for the long @-@ awa@@ ited intervals at the Bern@@ rie@@ der sport@@ scar are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent EU session it was taken up by a large discussion disp@@ ens@@ ed without great discussions .
&quot; above all , the panel was also decided on a request for the &quot; &quot; legal &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion , including valid &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; from current cultures . &quot;
&quot; with the &quot; exception , &quot; it was the permission for a special form on the attic . &quot;
&quot; therefore a &quot; &quot; saddle @-@ roof &quot; &quot; is designed to be built with non @-@ leading first and roof @-@ placed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; background of the planning is the planned use of the surface area for solar panels : &quot; &quot; this way we get a wonderfully large south , &quot; &quot; declared Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; release &quot; again , it was for the man@@ a@@ version that is for energetic reasons - other than in the Beb@@ ob Plan - below ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is therefore significantly reduced .
&quot; a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because of the building plan of the umbrella plan , no &quot; exceptions &quot; per@@ missible - in general the breakdown of liber@@ alisation is usually more restric@@ tive to liber@@ ating orders . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ence &quot; , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gym at the sports centre is a community project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2,3 million euros have to be calculated .
grants are expected by the training and board development .
in the next proceedings it will be submitted to the launch for the 18 x 36 meters high hall now to the reserve @-@ office to the exam .
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is said to be completed earlier than planned - i.e. 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new surgeon &apos;s director at the hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
the station and the majority of the employees pull together from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg with to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this will see the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , the governor of Andrea Jo@@ chner @-@ White . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on this will not meet the Supervis@@ ory Board and the meeting will take place on Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans should be put into action , all of the nearly 50 employees were working in the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority was to deal with fishermen and the further existing inside station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
&quot; employees , who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , then Jo@@ chner @-@ White . &quot;
the employees are informed of their plans .
&quot; the change has been triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer hospital at the beginning of the year and now he is out of a private practice in direct vicinity of the hospital . &quot;
&quot; the question of who is to follow up the follow@@ er , came out according to Jo@@ chner @-@ White , the name &quot; fishermen &quot; in the game , who declared himself willing to take over the lead and change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; this is a &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , in any case a &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; and an broad@@ ening of the proposal for &quot; &quot; internal medicine , &quot; &quot; says Jo@@ chner @-@ White . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for p@@ ac@@ emaker and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; col@@ lo@@ qui@@ ties for the next two years shall fishermen with his team , if the Supervis@@ ory Board agre@@ es to meet both houses , until then next year the former hospital of the pop@@ lars , which has over 35 beds , should be closed down to almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; until now the land was planned for 2018 , as the current renovation at the hospital Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed . &quot;
&quot; it is the land of the Munich @-@ white , which is also the chairman of the Supervis@@ ory Board , after which the house , which is owned by the federal government , is in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; I close it . as it goes on with the property , Jo@@ vica / White could not tell you , there were several reflections . &quot;
&quot; currently , there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ ch@@ sy@@ chi@@ atri@@ cs . &quot;
&quot; what Bes@@ ser@@ es could not happen , such an opportunity does not come back &quot; , &quot; as fishermen about the Qu@@ asi reloc@@ ation to Le@@ ch , received by the staff &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , which Fischer has been working as a che@@ ap@@ sack for over 30 years , did not exist . &quot;
he had been asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer Members to take over the post of medical director .
&quot; in the past decades the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened with closure in the past decades , departments have been closed , for example the surgery and Obst@@ etri@@ cs . &quot;
the hand@@ rails of the Rhine @-@ N@@ eck@@ ar Lion are required this evening ( 20.@@ 3 pm ) at the Berg@@ ischen HC .
&quot; the Bundes@@ liga of Bundes@@ liga is in Wupper@@ tal , although the clear favorite , occasion for arrogan@@ ce exists , however no one . &quot;

a crime no@@ od@@ ger has led the police to the body of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
&quot; there was the 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who killed young people and cast their cor@@ pse into a channel in Rock@@ h@@ ausen . &quot;
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate is neglected to violence .
&quot; the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ dog ausen in Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , where the pro@@ secutor &apos;s office and police were closed on Wednesday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; as tat@@ too , a recorded 20 @-@ year @-@ old is also regarded as a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , which was indeed resolved by stating and investig@@ ators to the discovery of the cor@@ pse . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old missed the Sunday morning was announced after the evening after a fall of a autumn day in Rock@@ h@@ ausen , didn &apos;t come home again . &quot;

the festival approved the authorities in the police of the police to have killed 16 @-@ year @-@ old and the bodies were put into the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be taken on Wednesday at the harbour , and investig@@ ators put it down to his load . &quot;

refugees need accommodations : a study war@@ ns against housing .
the location on the German housing market is tense .
more and more refugees are seeking a p@@ alle@@ able stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the battles on the German housing market have long since started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the coming refugees and work seek@@ er in the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is now over@@ bur@@ dened in many large cities . &quot;
they compete with strong citizens in their last affordable housing .
&quot; to cover the demand for affordable housing , there must be 400@@ ,000 new units built by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; in this result , one study enters on behalf of the verb@@ ose &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by comparison , this year there are 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units finished in Germany . &quot;
&quot; this will contain 14@@ 0@@ ,000 apartments . &quot;
&quot; refugees are no longer required after the first three months of their stay , as asylum seekers in a first accommodation accommodation . &quot;
many come up into the housing market and lined up in the long sn@@ akes in front of the flats .
&quot; according to statistics in the latter , less than half of all asylum seekers have stayed for rent in the last year . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising refugee figures . &quot;
the study also encourages considerable om@@ issions relating to housing policies over the past few years .
Germany ent@@ ails an housing defic@@ it coming by year to year bigger .
&quot; currently there were some 77@@ ,000 dwelling units in the metropolitan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many professional artists thus lived in large cities not@@ ated in WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; young adults were un@@ inten@@ tionally stayed longer in the &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; because of the flu@@ kes in the housing market . &quot;
in large cities the number of square meter per head over the past few years has fallen down again .
&quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; social housing &quot; &quot; presents a rest@@ art . &quot;
&quot; in this process , new incentives to stimulate the social housing construction again . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it could be abandoned on the under@@ line tax and the tax funds for subsidi@@ zed homes will be exposed . &quot;
&quot; moreover , according to an alliance , attractive tax breaks need be necessary . &quot;
the funding programme for the refugee population of the K@@ f@@ W has been working well in cities and communities .
&quot; a good week after the start was opened on Monday evening , with 18@@ 4 million euros , more than half of the accounts available around 300 million euros . &quot;
now the project could even be extended .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia are hall@@ ways
&quot; after Hungary , there is practically no enforcement of more , as more refugees choose the way to Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb An@@ no@@ un@@ ces to provide transit through Slovenia to north without hur@@ d@@ les .
&quot; however , the route is dangerous . &quot;
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I have spoken with the Sloven@@ ian Minister , and if it is necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian interior Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU @-@ country Croatia is not yet a Schengen area .
&quot; after the shut@@ down of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees returned to Croatia to move from there to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people were gone over the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV station &quot;
Hungary had shut up its border to refugees on the day before .
&quot; new laws , which occurred on the same day , do superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary is practically superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
Croatia wants to make the refugees happen .
&quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic said , &quot; You can go through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
however people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police had attacked the first refugees at the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia .
&quot; most of the specimens of the media are reported in Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they arrived by bus as well as with taxis in the Serbian border town S@@ id .
immediately after her arrival she tried to walk on foot over the green border to Croatia .
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border , the refugees are not confined to limit . &quot;
&quot; now , the border dot@@ es contains other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian Civil War in the 1990s . &quot;
mine clear@@ ers must quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; after Hungary , near the closure of the border there are hardly more refugees . &quot;
on Tuesday the police counted 3@@ 66 .
shortly before Tor@@ p on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws regul@@ ates the over@@ coming and damage of the border separ@@ atism as offen@@ se .
in the south @-@ Hungarian border town Sz@@ eg@@ ed then 35 criminal proceedings were introduced .
the sanctions declined for up to five years and the deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authorities , you have received a total of 94 asylum in the new on Tuesday in the new on the &quot; &quot; transit sessions &quot; &quot; in a total of 94 asylum - almost all - 93 - at the most important transition ride . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants , 13 families with small children and two elderly people . &quot;
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees to be stopped .
&quot; however , there is no longer a view to granted asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; safe country &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the ex@@ pi@@ red asylum seekers have to be de@@ ported .
&quot; ahead of the &quot; &quot; transit @-@ zone &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees gathered . &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers have begun to deal with it .
&quot; they gathered the garbage , leaving the tenth of thousands of people in the last weeks at the road@@ side . &quot;
pl@@ ural gate have been ab@@ assembled and one of the top models in the border area was rebuilt .
&quot; finally , no one wanted to express . &quot;
Austria reach the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary only a few more refugees .
the land also has its border checks .
&quot; around the 20,000 migrants were still facing the country , but still in the country . &quot;
in Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for the trip to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the German authorities .

Mayor drove &quot; over the border
&quot; after the bridge was busy on Sunday with the ti@@ dying , when suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot;
tourists wanted to get there by train to Pas@@ sau .
&quot; because Germany was surprisingly forced on Sunday because of the refugee flow with Austria , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein closure , &quot; as Stad@@ ler who immediately offered his help and the bases disappeared together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border to the river Na@@ he Pas@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; before , we did not wish to shor@@ ten the undes@@ ired guests at once , with ro@@ d@@ break and drinks . &quot;
we said immediately we got them by car to Pas@@ sau .
&quot; this goes without saying , &quot; &quot; Stad@@ ler in O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let it take a generous donation - 100 euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; we were very happy , &quot; &quot; says city . &quot;
&quot; the passengers arriving on Sunday evenings held in Wels from the ICE in a regional direction to Pas@@ sau , in order to un@@ successfully took it after the short term , that the railway traffic was dis@@ continued to Germany , but still to try over the border . &quot;
the regional train was turned off before the border into W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border @-@ border is generally high in the course .
the bridge @-@ firm association with the Bav@@ arian neighbours on Sunday was a soci@@ able day - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now send tens of tens of thousands to us , is a logical result of a pseudo @-@ holy policy : &quot;
&quot; instead of helping camp R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately in the establishment of structures to help humanity , our Chancellor hosted an official and publicly co @-@ operation of the Hungarian government in the government of National Socialism . &quot;
sorry of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now faced in the border @-@ areas with chaotic states .
&quot; the refugee camps must also be seen that the &quot; &quot; praised Land &quot; &quot; must be shown to be invited and welcome nothing but a further refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will become a great challenge , in the face of the continued refugee flows and the next winter , to create decent conditions for protection seekers . &quot;
and it will be even more to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad in search of 3@@ 5.000 winter@@ ing quar@@ es &quot;
Konrad has full of hands with the tre@@ p@@ est provision of all hands .
&quot; Christian Konrad , it is usual , that his word has weight . &quot;
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to initiate proceedings for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first state of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already managed to get a grip on .
&quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he told his first success . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday remains without great turmo@@ il said Konrad , and praised the organizational &quot; master@@ performance . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of the Interior , however , spoke of a &quot; &quot; serious situation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; altogether , Konrad , is counting on a total of 8@@ ,000 quart@@ z in the he@@ ur@@ ly year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , they must still be found 35@@ ,000 accommodations in the next weeks - 20,000 will make the countries deplo@@ y , 15@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; should it be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s not a bot@@ tom@@ less pit , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already held talks with the cent@@ uri@@ ons .
&quot; these would have secured him , also for the coming refugees of Qu@@ arti@@ ere . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; said Ferry Ma@@ ier . &quot;
the former VP Av@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born in the morning , to be clari@@ fied how the church will help . &quot;
&quot; high expectations demands the asylum coordin@@ ator also in the OR@@ F action &quot; &quot; helping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the platform , individuals can be able to offer complete accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you will be hoping for hotels that will be empty during the winter . &quot;
&quot; Conrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of schedule , it could not be that quot@@ ations will have to deliver a certain height of the tu@@ ch@@ craft or size of the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary time , &quot; &quot; standards &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot;
&quot; he was successful in opposition to the Ministry of Interior , founded by Konrad with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gentleman , who cannot really face the un@@ truth without any further . &quot;
belief power is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier the Republic do not cause any costs as they themselves said .
your co @-@ workers want to increase their number to three to four .
your own Qu@@ arti@@ facts has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to place a container at Stephan@@ splatz .
nevertheless there are apparently problems with the permission .
Linz calls for better distribution
&quot; for the first time , no opening of municipal sports centres and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design centre for accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary for the case , as one could not support those affected without these measures at the moment , &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; however , for emergen@@ cies , more sites will be tested for their fitness . &quot;
the chief of the boss is committed to the division of refugees inside the Bundes@@ land .
also other districts must make their contribution here .
&quot; seal , &quot; borders are not turned off &quot;
in a longer telephone calls with the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) the Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ech@@ inger ( VP ) was accepted on Monday for further action in the refugee question .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer has assured me that the German borders are not locked .
further development of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany is further possible .
however there should now be the corresponding limit control .
spezi@@ al excerpts with refugees from Germany there will be no more .
the prot@@ ector would however were brought with regular trains to Germany .
&quot; with the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ s called for greater solidarity in the refugee question . &quot;
Austria once again leads to its borders and passes for &quot; a logical consequence &quot; from the action of the Germans .
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a question of time
the re@@ @-@ re@@ positioning of the &quot; New Wor@@ ker &quot; in the Lin@@ zer O@@ line is officially completed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T moved out , the rest ( 2@@ 700 square meters ) should be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area . &quot;
&quot; in IT , the clever heads are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Dut@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he could imagine to invest in startup companies of the New ad and later on to act .
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - even though the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a matter of time : &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million Euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3 million euros from the Tech@@ center , the one to two thirds of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Con@@ federation ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is run by the Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and Tech@@ center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 2@@ 700 square meters of resi@@ dual area in the building are rented , for more than 40 percent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ Car@@ lo@@ ader opened second business in the Arctic
in the new shop Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are in the centre .
&quot; actually , J@@ utta is going to serve a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to move the 49 year old daughter of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt - Fin@@ ade : after all , it has got its awakening in the form of another business center . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the business , in which it sells amongst other bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of different manufacturers , all about the ladies pockets of the brand Fur@@ la , pur@@ ses are available from 75 Euro . &quot;
bigger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
previously several weeks has been updated .
&quot; but I have long over@@ lays , if I want to open a store , &quot; said bro@@ adly . &quot;
&quot; determining for the decision was , among other things , that also the Fur@@ la producers who are at home from the idea of an own location , where only their hand@@ bags had been sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz that sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has even Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has gained wide from her mother in the cradle .
&quot; for me , most of them have developed and I can show new trends at affordable prices . &quot;
why so some woman is looking to have a nice pur@@ se in sol@@ ec@@ stasy is also to answer the house@@ wife with last security .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag is upgraded for each out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ maker of K@@ all@@ city
&quot; the Pf@@ al@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a location , whose inhabitants are called &quot;
this property also combines some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for exciting .
&quot; whether he is manifest@@ ed as xen@@ opho@@ bic , journalist , or devoted of knowledge in the international crisis policy - the applic@@ ant of the US presidential campaign will give the election campaign power@@ fully . &quot;
and cuts out well .
this is also recorded in the pf@@ alz region where the grandparents of the property milli@@ ard originate .
the New Yorker with the hair @-@ hair @-@ hair@@ style is a term in the wine @-@ village in many wine .
man@@ ure in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ place is related to it by -@@ y no@@ o@@ ks with it .
&quot; his grandfather came out of K@@ all@@ stadt in Pal@@ atine : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in the election mode . &quot;
the Conc@@ ern@@ ess Simone Wen@@ del directed a film about Tru@@ mp .
&quot; and what do the vill@@ agers think about their goal , become a most powerful man in the world ? &quot;
&quot; I think that will find it exciting , but are not so deeply impressed by their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
native Croatian city has filmed a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous pet@@ s@@ lings dedicated to the addition of Tru@@ mp and also the Ket@@ ch@@ up Family Heinz .
&quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mod@@ esty , comes in the &quot; kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would be safe even if he would live in K@@ all@@ city . &quot;
at the king of the hearts he did not bring it there .
&quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to give the opinion that Tru@@ mp &quot; is already a bit of a Greater mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; accidentally , the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the radius covered &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; &quot; - too high in German : the cover , says it . &quot;
&quot; thus , Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the show @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the later grandfather was emig@@ rated and in the USA opened a pub for Gold@@ mines . &quot;
cornerst@@ one of the real estate group were the first properties in New York .
&quot; the life of the grandparents was not free of animal rights : their desire to return at the duration to the homeland , failed to return to the Bav@@ arian State to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was then belonged . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tru@@ mp because he was once hardened without a permit , the director of the Institute for pf@@ alz History and Folklore , Roland Paul , at the film start . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
&quot; at contrast , this is contrast to the sometimes marked statements by the offspring . &quot;
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and called the construction of a border wall to prevent illegal immigrants .
&quot; just as the pol@@ ling , this is not so sympathetic &quot; , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , there was a kne@@ aded m@@ mp ( &quot; &quot; The O@@ ma was a born ch@@ mp , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &apos; ) . &quot;
&quot; the v@@ int@@ ners in retirement the Americans are more dist@@ ancing the Americans , &quot; &quot; he is always so short @-@ temper@@ ed . &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp comes ?
&quot; I cannot imagine it , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never car@@ es about K@@ all@@ city , too . &quot;
&quot; the Pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ r@@ amm is mentioned as some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz turned into a visit to the church of the church , which was generally well announced . &quot;
&quot; this can &apos;t be present to me of Donald , &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it gets better if he did not know the choice , because &quot; &quot; he did not know such a radical view . I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had in the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like him , he would never have arrived there at all . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ land@@ son Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my president is not it , &quot; she says . &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the president of Tru@@ mp .

&quot; this down@@ side of the resistance seemed to be not a role for Australian TV audience , as Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators on the five main cities , compared to that Today : 33@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; today a slight increase in comparison with the ratings of Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and the last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today in the last months there has been a gap for Sun@@ rise .

the big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former mass @-@ ar of packed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thomson .
&quot; the new drama about a recently wit@@ ted father , who exclu@@ des himself with his two children at the New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators . &quot;
critics had asked herself if she could present a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening said this with a clear &quot; Yes . &quot;
&quot; the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and hit the cluster ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ B@@ L ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had bl@@ ended results in the evening two of The Chase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show was hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe , on average 44@@ 6,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;

the final three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably do not know who The Bachelor is gaining . &quot;
&quot; finally the wife , at which Sam Wood eventually landed in The bach@@ elor , was wrapped in the greatest mystery . &quot;
none of the three left @-@ loved girls will certainly not show if they are the one who has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we dealt with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , Sne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows the day before three become two , you may have accidentally given an indication of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood continues his lips to the finale on Thursday .
&quot; all three women have been om@@ itted in ly@@ rical fashion , why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humour , ambition , family values , and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should be the last rose ? &quot; &quot; could their answers about the per@@ is@@ ance who won the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s or . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called out both quickly - except itself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies stopped , I felt that they were pretty compatible and I did it throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Ev@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands on Earth with both feet on Earth , it is so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood were well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the first visit to last week her made it clear that Wood continues to be &quot; the One . &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ compromising to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked to whom Wood had to vote , if not for her , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I do not know if I can tell that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - there is a tie between Sne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 p.m. , on Ten . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the United States - and there were many other teams following his impressive open workout day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainers Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise choice .
&quot; some coach would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank , when he lost an angel , as it did the Aussie Rug@@ by @-@ league &apos;s Guide at his first P@@ unt @-@ return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota . &quot;
&quot; but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ es the next opportunity to return to a pop@@ unt , and even to the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to show its true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of gr@@ ro@@ am the rest of the team thanks to the gr@@ inder he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne also in his press conference after the match .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams @-@ coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ g@@ he@@ y , who advised him to forget his seduc@@ ed catch and take care of the next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne is pat@@ ched in a p@@ unt , which was located in the first quarter of the Minnesota State rank@@ ings . &quot;
it was certainly not the start I had hoped to Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian geography for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left on the F@@ um@@ ble cur@@ sing the playing field and later told the Australian radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not have had a worse start to his N@@ FL career ?
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne caught up the car@@ vers with his Ori@@ gin Deb@@ ir at that time in 2007 when a pass on his own in @-@ go@@ al area led to a Tr@@ y for Queensland .
&quot; still , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

&quot; leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger war@@ med up at the beginning of the F@@ W @-@ Aut@@ umn to a serious crisis in Bavaria , when it comes to new teacher for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to preserve the schools before the collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get wor@@ ship@@ ments in the Bav@@ arian education system . &quot;
the ple@@ th@@ ment of the free voters continued till Friday in the fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
&quot; actually , all other main subjects were planned . &quot;
&quot; but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free voters . &quot;
&quot; obviously the subject of asylum will over@@ lay the clo@@ ister , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN @-@ zones for refugees in Syria , just as they were in the 1930@@ s during the 1930@@ s . &quot;
&quot; so it goes on , we must go to the causes , &quot; said the Free voters chief . &quot;
long @-@ standing asylum seekers want to push the free voters off as soon as possible .
&quot; that &apos;s why ai@@ wan@@ ger also called for more staff for the administration , which are responsible for asylum and we also need at least 50 new asylum system , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
the F@@ W boss cri@@ tici@@ zed that several states were not consistent with the nation@@ wide standards of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; Bavaria sho@@ ves , others not . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we need to act sc@@ u@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , the provincial government should not fall under the table . &quot;
a long @-@ lasting endurance stay on the agenda : the education policy .

but this is not far enough .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot;
we demand freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ ums they want .
free ride at the G@@ 9 everywhere where it is desired .

4 people killed after police officer stopped in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 year old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police arrested in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said an officer on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday night in Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital city of Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Colum@@ nis@@ ts District , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside of a police station , with some of you throwing stones and fire@@ bombs . &quot;
&quot; Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police have used Tr@@ än@@ sen , and then shot in the air before it res@@ or@@ ted to Gum@@ mi@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the used rubber @-@ stories , from which it is known that they can kill as traditional as less deadly alternative , obviously produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal as southern planes , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ ri@@ i say that new provinces , which were formed within the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence . &quot;
&quot; there were also protests in the western Nepal , from the ethnic group of the neo@@ conserv@@ atives , who want to create their own state . &quot;
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officials , were arrested in violent conflicts since the 10 . &quot;
&quot; killed in August when the four major political parties under@@ signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution but a very controversial issue in Nepal , the centuries ago was central . &quot;
&quot; working on a new constitution since 2008 has been on its way , but the legisl@@ ator accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legisl@@ ator have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;

Google starts re@@ doubled commitment campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ based campaign to raise the 11 million $ for humanitarian organisations covering thousands of refugees , who are overwhelmed by the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach in posting the donations in his blog .
&quot; instead of leaving for an manager , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google collabor@@ ator , who was flying with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our trip included many dark types and bus trips , as well hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants were grown in Europe , a lot of people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; the donations are made available to four charitable organisations attempting to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first global wealth of donations collected up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ der@@ .com / loan up to 11 million will be doubled .
&quot; Europe has been faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , and largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has sold more than 4 million people this year . &quot;

coverage by Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; adaptation of Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
for easily obes@@ e diabe@@ tics can be helpful with weight @-@ pleas@@ urable surgery .
the advantages of weight los@@ sy for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
&quot; it is still too early to say whether easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight los@@ s@@ surgery longer live as those who get non @-@ surgical treatments . &quot;
&quot; the death data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of the weight loss surgery , which wrote an editorial supporting the new study in J@@ ama Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity operations have been proven effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who have an illness @-@ obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) by 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is obes@@ e and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can charge your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng general hospital data that they have been collected since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - gast@@ ric b@@ ypass and gast@@ ric cancer for type 2 @-@ diabetes in people who were slightly overweight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I under those , under@@ goes this operation , sank from 31 on 24.@@ 5 until the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical Diabetes treatments , approximately with 29 . &quot;
&quot; in those who have subjected to a surgical procedure , 36 % dis@@ solved by 36 % of the diabetes disease and a total of 28 % . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with diabetes , the medical @-@ treated group can be found completely only by one percent and partly by only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L Cholester@@ ols &quot; were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the writers found themselves . &quot;
&quot; researchers also monitoring the patient &apos;s blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best held under 7 per cent by means of the researchers .
&quot; after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in in A@@ 1@@ c levels fell from around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , in medical therapy group however , it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but these better &quot; &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; &quot; - as it reflects in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease the mortality rate in five years , so the guiding researchers Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also offers average results for the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ re@@ frac@@ tom@@ y group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , slightly decl@@ ines in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3,@@ 1 % vs. 2.4 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.4 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in have a complete over@@ supply of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show any survival for the surgery five years after surgery , there are references from a study of more serious people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was a obesity factor in obesity , about 29 percent less likely to die within 15 years , compared to a group , more conventional methods tried . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery , Black@@ stone said it was re@@ ass@@ uring for people with a BM@@ I under 35 , which are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I Group , without the risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I , between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we wait too long until we take people to take it seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have made these genetic changes , the body associated with obesity and diabetes is a revers@@ al of really hard . &quot;

&quot; it &apos;s impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; Europe cannot take up all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist leader also urged to end the violence in the homeless countries of refugees .
&quot; the Dalai Lama promised the issue of the continued refugee crisis at the beginning of its ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to Eth@@ ic studies . &quot;
&quot; under the given circumstances , he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents . &quot;
&quot; he stressed that the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama visited Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to get out of the crisis , he stressed that there is only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; taking care of several thousands of refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you have to think about long term solutions , such as real peace and genuine development , mainly due to education , for these Muslim countries &quot; , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
ultimately we have to think about how killing in their countries is reduced .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s actions following the terrorist attack on 11 September and turned out that the violent response from the US moved a chain of un@@ contro@@ llable events .
&quot; after the 11th September I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I said to him the way to resol@@ ving this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence and that has prov@@ oked turmo@@ il &quot; , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of in@@ gestion of hand san@@ iti@@ zer by children in the last 4 years
&quot; Po@@ ison centers in the US are reporting an almost 400 @-@ percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , taking heavily on non @-@ alcoholic beverages , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under the age of 12 came down to Po@@ iti@@ sed Centers , from 3.@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; kids always come more frequently to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children could have a dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant , while some it do to impres@@ s their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media . &quot;
YouTube video on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants can only drink because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have said to be reck@@ oned with dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with non @-@ alcoholic fats in order to obtain a tough@@ er drink .
younger children can be filled with attractive scents of the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child doesn &apos;t think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are par@@ ted .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange , which are very pleasing for children . &quot;
hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially children can already lead to few squir@@ ts to alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the attack centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Transm@@ utation Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would not let slip whis@@ ky tiles , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come on it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently taken four sy@@ ringe from him to straw@@ berry sc@@ ented hand@@ san@@ iti@@ zer at school , was taken into a note of emergency treatment . &quot;
&quot; its blood @-@ concentration was in 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is by law at law as dr@@ unken , &quot; said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency physician , who examined them at the G@@ win@@ nett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah gave their words and was not able to walk as she came to an emergency .
&quot; she grab@@ bed her overnight in a separate child hospital with signs of Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen by the alcohol and hit the head , said k@@ ak@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; it was very wor@@ ris@@ ome , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs Mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal to my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ories outside the reach of the child .
over alcohol pois@@ oning also uses a few dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with deaths .
&quot; in 2013 two women in Ontario women died after the swal@@ lowing of Hän@@ del @-@ infectious agents , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities suspect that the product Me@@ than@@ ol contained the product of meth@@ anol , a mortal solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol that has been recorded as a active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January the three students of the fourth class in the State of New York sought to pois@@ oning their &quot; teacher &quot; teacher , putting them anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom &quot; , &quot; says a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to res@@ tra@@ des@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and to the appointed ones in their area .
the police regarded the eit@@ ed plan as &quot; g@@ ossi@@ p &quot; and trans@@ disciplinary policies to the debt .

rum@@ ors about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow in what &apos;s been rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . insisted that he and his team mates are not under total control since they are preparing to the confrontation with the Dutch table leader .
&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel that under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of competition competition in the Scottish soccer player - de Bo@@ er
former ranked ancest@@ or and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch soccer fans have lost interest in Celtic unless there is no title of rival@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
&quot; said an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Netherlands they show no highlights from Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the ranking is not there .
people here are not just talking about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
you speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and this is what they are interested .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ fir@@ s games and there are not just the people in Scotland that want to see these games .
I will push the things swe@@ ar and swe@@ ar .
Ron@@ ny D@@ ei@@ la accepts that Celtic people have to fight but the Norwegian boss sw@@ or to turn things around .
&quot; after the defeat of Malmö and the subsequent retirement from the Champions League followed the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who now stand at the head of the table with five points lead . &quot;
&quot; D@@ ei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will be back . &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happened . &quot;
we feel this exactly like this - but we need to go further .
&quot; we really need support from Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot;
&quot; now together , it is so important . &quot;

the ex @-@ chief of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer @-@ window . &quot;
players who come in the summer have this pre @-@ season to integrate themselves what you &apos;ve seen with our own group in this season .
the team is really good .
&quot; sometimes , more damage is caused by adding up unnecessary players to the one you really need . &quot;

&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; There is no crew who won everything in poker play or le@@ agues , the games of this kind have not been won at once . &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while in the UK as a whole increases .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland stayed in the period May to July remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 , whereas the number of people without work for the United Kingdom has risen from 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate at 5.@@ 9 percent was about 5.5 per cent of the UK@@ s of 5.5 per cent in the figures of the Bureau for National Statisti@@ cs ( ON@@ S ) .
&quot; in the meantime employment in Scotland fell by 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12.@@ 000 . &quot;
the employment rate for Scotland occurred in the course of the quarter at 7@@ 4.3 percent - a figure above the UK level of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ el commented the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost a year ago that Scotland has made historical decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months , we have seen further improvements on the sc@@ ot@@ tish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;

why I will be witn@@ essing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; somewhat later today , except in a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is put to death . &quot;

he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
&quot; the invitation was first mentioned in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; as the day came closer , I began to fear . &quot;
&quot; so , why should I do it ? &quot;
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists should be allowed to see in the United States , and as many times more applications are available , a larger Lot@@ tery will take place to decide who is elected . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
&quot; who is chosen , it will be full of emotion . &quot;
I cannot do that .
&quot; next to Richard Sig@@ si@@ ps , I will have a nice friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone conversations and a two and a half hours . &quot;
I like the guy .
we laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the e@@ dic@@ le authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be permitted to see a notebook and a pen , to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it , and you will get access . &quot;
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; they pointed out that they &quot; &quot; it could have better formulated , &quot; &quot; but she is still thinking that it is wrong with what I do . &quot;
Richard Sig@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he does not tell me what to write , and I would not do it myself , even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
&quot; however , he wants an international news@@ man to be present in order to write there . &quot;
&quot; if he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help the movement against capital punishment . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please feel the series of pod@@ casts that I have made . &quot;
I want not to mention here again all the details .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ a p is inno@@ cent .
his acts after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would blame him to be the benefici@@ ary of act .
&quot; however , I believe that a strong lik@@ el@@ ihood is that he is not guilty of killing . &quot;
&quot; I believe , that there is not enough evidence to justify a person of deaths . &quot;
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I shall see him dying .
I cannot claim to be truly objective .
there will be other re@@ porters who you can apply for this .
&quot; what you will get from me , is what it means to see a man of unnecessary death die . &quot;

&quot; he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do that which is best for the racing and he himself has found himself under difficult conditions than it was about the positive cob@@ alt Tu@@ horse during Li@@ dar@@ is that he cannot explain .
he had kept back 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ onage &apos;s accus@@ ations and it didn &apos;t want it to see it as much hanging from the grapes .
&quot; I had nothing to say about this and I have long forgotten , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
they know there are far @-@ reaching .
&quot; sometimes you are responding , and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with that which I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to raise my head up , and I want my owners think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; when they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be a coach . &quot;
&quot; then I must think , what I do with my license . &quot;
&quot; previously , Moo@@ dy was able to commit the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department tried to send out his stable . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ teen months , Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - I will call if I was asked - and offered him a job in my stables for providing information about what I do within my stables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they are obvious that I am a fraud .
&quot; if that is the case , they should surely touch their n@@ oses because they have an attempt to put me into action . &quot;
&quot; Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ dy &apos;s CEO of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today . &quot;
should I bring that to the mind that it will personally ?
&quot; does the R@@ V@@ L cow@@ ard@@ ly behave and maybe makes people outside of coaches , responsible for what is going on in the industry ? &quot;
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps people are thinking out there that I &apos;m there .
&quot; maybe they must take my license and rep@@ el me , and I have no doubt that what I say to think about it now . &quot;
&quot; but I am now at the point where this does not matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
it makes me really sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have got support from my family and I can go .
&quot; trainers &apos; levels of trainer have built themselves up with long @-@ long cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching resulted in that he could throw &quot; his license above the table . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy is best known for his preparation of the un@@ written master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , the race treatment is &quot; laugh@@ able &quot; &quot; after a pack of mud or sound on the horse @-@ deb@@ ated had been applied to the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is opposed to the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees has mistak@@ enly called mud on the leg . &quot;
it could have been yesterday evening so .
it could have been yesterday the whole day so it was .
but it had also that on the race day .
Moo@@ dy might be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the packing on the race day . an examination of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
&quot; people who impose these rules , know nothing about the horse . &quot;
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have to go too far &quot; , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
man arrested in Cur@@ rent Cur@@ sed
the police arrested a man after a collision with a cycl@@ ist and followed up in Cob@@ ram .
the cycl@@ ist was supplied with the helicopter in the Royal Melbourne Hospital to serious injury after it was hit by a car on the Saturday morning on the Murray @-@ Valley highway .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Bell@@ amy proposes to fight ri@@ vals for cont@@ ends
Melbourne @-@ Storm , Bell@@ amy has also expressed criticism of the Tac@@ kling of its players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favorites of the NR@@ L . &quot;
Sydney Roo@@ ster coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said the arbitr@@ ator will be w@@ rest@@ led with his team during the high storm victory in the Sydney Final in Sydney on Friday night .
&quot; Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer , Wayne Ben@@ nett made a little disgu@@ ised note about the Storm Team , after his team had the final victory against North Queensland cow@@ boys on the Saturday night . he called the two from Queensland to be &quot; good &quot; in w@@ rest@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of its crew , and said they were only concentrated in their &quot; contact &quot; during the tac@@ kling . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy also added that the criticism of two leading trainers and his team would confi@@ dently agree , since it means that they were worried about the Storm team struck . &quot;
&quot; that appears over and over again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring @-@ fight , as she took us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy in Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that in the whole year we have changed nothing to our defensive system or the techniques . yet , in the past six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles as a real focus , and that provided us with the trend . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to exercise . it is therefore probably not being accu@@ stom@@ ed to losing , so it was a bit a shock for him . &quot;
it &apos;s just com@@ edic as it appears over and over again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked the idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his mentor that Ben@@ net@@ ts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday evening with our evening on Fri@@ day@@ night and how it was exciting their game was &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was cri@@ tici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wayne said that he would take care of a shit . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team to play and that is exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
&quot; that is the ball game , you want to play when you have these kinds of players . &quot;
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his ways to play football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt , giving them how to play them . &quot;
&quot; I have strengthened confidence on because they are saying these things , because they are a bit worried about having to play against us . &quot;
six weeks ago they probably didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ ster had a higher result than the game Bron@@ co to its cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game , but is this an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks @-@ breaks and do not have any points any tension ?
for me it is the maps .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we are going to meet in one phase after them . &quot;
the Storm team is free on this weekend as they have the right to receive either North Queensland cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sale begins on next Tuesday morning .
&quot; beer with 200,000 $ deposit after drug @-@ turn &quot;
&quot; a man who could potentially face a lifel@@ ong sentence for his attempt to come in the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine that were imported to Queensland , in a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Marko Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who have been arrested last month after the federal police took 100 kg of the drug to the Yacht Sol@@ ay , who arrived from South America to Vanuatu in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed , as he received his co @-@ def@@ endants in the J@@ ach@@ work , during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a viable penalty for trying to possess a commercial deal of co@@ ca@@ ine , argued the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , there is no evidence that he tried to own the whole lot and that in the coffee shop might have been out of any harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the death of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often moves to Serbia . &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .
in the case of the law he wei@@ gh@@ ed the police about his position .
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together , to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; following reading the aff@@ id@@ av@@ its explanations of the two persons , it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Richter flan@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; however , that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from being out , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he returns to his Australian and Serbian passport , consecr@@ ated to the police and pays off to a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident at A@@ 5 at Karlsruhe : coverage apart
at a dri@@ ve@@ way with three trucks on the motorway 5 at Karlsruhe is very hard injured on Tuesday night .
two of the three participating trucks had a continuous position in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver marked it too late and in vain , to do@@ dge in the last moment to the left , as the police hur@@ ried . &quot;
the dri@@ &apos;s House of the accident @-@ judgment is completely contradic@@ ted .
the driver was heavily damaged in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed over six hours to 2 pm .
&quot; the result was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 Euro . &quot;
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone from girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es employed the phone of a 11 year old girl to request images of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl when this was asleep and logged into an on @-@ line mess@@ aging service that he received a number of un@@ important pictures of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping h@@ og@@ g .
she saw it through her found the be@@ wil@@ dering messages and al@@ armed immediately her mother .
&quot; the police took care of it and looked at the five pictures , and then analysed the computers , which were found under the address and found &quot; &quot; web @-@ resear@@ ches &quot; , &quot; which I used for un@@ inde@@ xed pictures of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g pointed out to the officials that he did it , since it would lead to &quot; &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le on the internet , &quot; and he then &quot; predicted to be a poli@@ cem@@ an in order to fri@@ ghten them . &quot;
&quot; pro@@ secutor , N@@ ili@@ dh Robert@@ son said to the Dun@@ dee sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be an addiction that he is addic@@ ted to fri@@ ghten people . &quot;
&quot; he adm@@ its that the searches on the computer were performed by him , but he said it had to happen because he claimed to be a poli@@ cem@@ an , to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le . &quot;
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked them to send even more photos .
he said he did it to enti@@ ce them .
&quot; he said he was sick in his head , when he has drink , and he said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
MS Robert@@ son said : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on the trem@@ bling and the crying .
she then saw the final pictures on the phone and confron@@ ting the accused .
&quot; the girl was inter@@ viewed and said , that the accused computer and Play@@ station used to talk to girls who saw much younger than he . &quot;

tow soft to small border crossing to Germany
&quot; increasingly , more refugees are taken up from the big monitoring points at the Franco @-@ Austrian border . &quot;
many tro@@ users were born out of fear of discovery and capture people from smaller border crossing events
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man said to the federal police . &quot;
&quot; along the border river , Pas@@ sau and Rot@@ a @-@ Inn has been taken up more than 1,000 refugees from the highway . &quot;
they were walking over bridges and dirt on the German side .
there they are taken in reception by federal police and passed on to the registration .
at the Munich main train station met for federal police @-@ data compared to the weekend at the end of Wednesday last year again a lot more refugees .
&quot; at 8 : 00 a.m. , around 700 people were in the provincial capital , said a spokes@@ man in the morning . &quot;
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the Franco @-@ Austrian border the town was reached on Tuesday 17@@ 59 refugees .
Stuttgart : for@@ erun@@ ner of Tro@@ l@@ storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the south @-@ west
meteor@@ ologists warn against am@@ mb@@ groves in the southwest of mid @-@ day afternoon .
&quot; due to a low @-@ pressure zone of Western Europe , the German Weather Service ( D@@ W@@ D ) shared with the German Weather Service ( D@@ W@@ D ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the vigor@@ ous th@@ ief is the for@@ erun@@ ner of the Tro@@ pen@@ di@@ ms &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; , &quot; which had gone from the Atlantic in the past few days . &quot;
fierce storms and storms are expected primarily in Baden .
&quot; according to D@@ W@@ D , until Thursday morning the Black Forest and Lake Constance , at the Sw@@ ab@@ seek@@ er and the Lake seek@@ er , he is expected to climb over 60 to 90 km / h . &quot;
Friday can be back no longer the sun again .
the mass makes it : every two years the car@@ makers show off their new products .
2015 is especially the move to the compact car cars who are currently particularly well being sold .
cars from the compact class are currently particularly asked : around 2@@ 8.1 percent of new appro@@ vals were allocated according to the federal government ( KBA ) alone in August and this segment .
this is also reflected at the IA@@ A ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new upper class and luxury cars are presented this year mainly with many new comp@@ act@@ ness models .
&quot; one of the biggest premi@@ ums for the German high@@ ways is the Opel A@@ stra , which is in the fall of the dealers . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ stra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; said Opel @-@ boss Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann in the exhibition . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; thus , the volume model is also well sold , the new A@@ stra should also not be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel expects an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf in view , which starts at € 17 650 . &quot;
the current A@@ stra costs from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
it is possible with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 horse@@ power .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse also offer another diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 PS to 147 kW / / 200 HP , which for the first time are three cylinder pet@@ rol . &quot;
unlike the most important competitor VW Golf and Ford Focus there is the Opel A@@ stra initially only one @-@ fifth .
&quot; as a second variant , I will follow the Com@@ bi in the spring of the Com@@ bi , who is also visible on the IA@@ A . &quot;
and what is next to the A@@ stra at the IA@@ A still working on new comp@@ actor ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault is the fourth generation of his A@@ stra competition Mé@@ gan@@ e &apos;s race .
on the fair the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively as the fifth in a conventional and an enhanced sporting GT @-@ version .
&quot; in the trade he comes in the beginning of next year , then also as a com@@ bi . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan &apos;s spin@@ ach wants to find its position in the strong growing segment with the new model .
&quot; here , the compact Infin@@ iti is suitable with its curved lines full in the design line of the brand . &quot;
the basic model will get a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 b@@ hp .
but it is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp and 125 kW / 170 HP .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno that is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; this model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.@@ 0 @-@ liter @-@ tur@@ bom@@ ot@@ or and an output of 82 kW / 111 . &quot;
the maximum torque is for producers of 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales start of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is scheduled for spring 2016 .
&quot; Ds 4 : not brand new , but completely renewed is the compact model DS 4 , which is to be seen at the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; outside , the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n deri@@ ves all hand at the front part : here the fridge was re@@ marked and the changed head@@ lights with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , especially the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch@@ screen and the first time the Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play . &quot;
&quot; at the IA@@ A , there is a range of work@@ ings and new versions like the Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 GT@@ I . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are human un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitu@@ tional Court has given an ex @-@ prisoner of the United Nations pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , and the mon@@ t@@ ang lived in one to a small cell . &quot;
&quot; because of the injury of their human dignity , prisoners are essentially entitled to financial compensation if they are contained in too small cells . &quot;
this has decided on the Federal Constitu@@ tional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
those afflic@@ ted by the judges are even hoped to their money if they were locked only a few days in the prison of confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
&quot; as a result , an ex @-@ prisoner starts with his constitutional complaints in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in the outskirts of Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with around five square meters of land ; the toilet was spatial not separate . &quot;
&quot; after this , the man , who has now been moved back to an open cell according to his address , has been moved to a larger cell . &quot;
his official liability for the un@@ worthy defensive conditions for the country of Berlin failed .
but the Constitu@@ tional Court raised the judgment of the chamber of the chamber in Berlin and rejected the case for the renewed study .
they see the man &apos;s human dignity in viol@@ ated .
chamber service now decides over the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons of the questionable period only a few days of exposure to compensation are largely made to compensation , a compensation was given . &quot;
otherwise there would be a res@@ h@@ ed of the legal protection of the personality to fear .
the chamber of the chamber must finally be resolved to the amount of the allowance .
the reform@@ ers have often strengthened the rights of un@@ constitutional reforms in the past .
&quot; thus , they spoke only in April to a prisoner , because he was lying naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; human un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 and also the multip@@ lication of a cell with no separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , furthermore , the Berlin Constitu@@ tional Court held in addition to the Berlin Constitu@@ tional Court , who held a prisoner in a parallel operation in November 2009 . &quot;
&quot; the former K@@ lä@@ ger was held daily between 15 and 21 hours , in a similar cell , such as in the s@@ ary . &quot;
the Berlin pris@@ ons had also come to the head@@ lines in the last weeks because of the missing personnel .
&quot; prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ siveness rise , even to pun@@ ching , it should have already come because of the tense situation . &quot;
&quot; according to all the judicial measures , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the young@@ sters , the 19 shall be put away in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create that &quot;
the immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to embrace her .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; about 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany by forecasts for the Federal Ministry of Commerce this year , according to the statement of Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to take up a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge ? &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we create that .
what is added to Germany gives the following an overview .
&quot; they are needed according to various forecasts between 3@@ 50@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institute ) , for the next five years . &quot;
that is almost twice as much as it has been built up until now ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; dramatic is the lack of living room but above all in affordable rent objects : annually , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ ,000 social apartments come out of rent , and these particularly favourable apartments will also apply to refugees . &quot;
&quot; Prime Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) is therefore intended to double the production , currently 5@@ 18 million at a billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing or a year , and for this reason the federal government should invest in the amount of 6.@@ 4 billion a year . &quot;
scientists and federal states agree that there must be more tax benefits for investments in housing construction .
the Institute for Employment and occupational research is estimated that 55 percent of the poultry in Germany may be made in the long term .
&quot; however , refugees in Germany would not greatly be asked for their qualifications to help them establish , critic@@ ised Claudia Walter , project man@@ ag@@ erial for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
but it is vital for the integration of refugees to find out whether they are working in Germany .
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the esteem in the Ent@@ rance company , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the others , Mig@@ rations to Diet@@ rich Thr@@ es@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ es@@ hardt , it was given a political shift : from working agreement to refugees to recognise the work . &quot;
&quot; while there was formerly a working grounds for asylum seekers from up to five years ago , this was reduced in November 2014 to three months , as well as the residen@@ ces that restrict asylum seekers to a place of residence . &quot;
in society - even because of the lack of qualified labour - it has consistently achieved view that refugees should be able to achieve more access to the labor market faster than because of the lack of qualified labour .
a big hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is lack of German .
&quot; so far , there is still no adequate supply of general and professional @-@ related courses . &quot;
research also shows that jobs are most commonly given by personal contacts .
therefore the development of networks is therefore the point of view of Thr@@ es@@ hardt the Königs@@ weg for labour integration .
&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few escaped parents will give their children to the kids , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the root @-@ rooted parents , it is only important to hold the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ ł@@ yst@@ bar , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Senate department . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , spread the administration hand@@ y@@ line in different languages . &quot;
&quot; should the need for educ@@ ators increase greatly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the apprentic@@ es@@ hips - for example , by per@@ mitting more technical schools . &quot;
in the countries pupils without German knowledge in welcome classes will be prepared in the lessons .
&quot; but they are not always instruc@@ ted by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , are also of teachers who only have one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage , says Be@@ ate St@@ out from the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German Student@@ en@@ werk estimates that some 20 percent of the refugees are planning to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no federal , asylum seekers or re@@ inde@@ ers studied the study - the only exception to so far Berlin , Interior of Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) , has now given up its position . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; learning full refugees could be reli@@ eved of access to the university . &quot;
&quot; for refugees with a period of residence or dem@@ nific@@ ation do not receive any services after asylum seekers , when they begin studying . &quot;
the latter is not a B@@ Af@@ ö@@ G since they are not falling among the circle of b@@ af@@ ly persons .
&quot; tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for up to four years to attend B@@ Af@@ ö@@ G @-@ entitled , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financing of funding must also be concluded ; Steff@@ en Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Student@@ en@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get B@@ Af@@ ö@@ G .
&quot; in future , Islam will play a more important role in the future ; for many refugees are Muslims , and for many more religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should inher@@ it the same rights over the same rights as it forms the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches have the right to develop a new state religions . &quot;
&quot; important would also be the creation of an Islamic welfare , which will professionally take care of the newcom@@ ers . &quot;
the rights belong to the rights as well .
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be willing to work with the state in many areas and to afford certain controls . &quot;
&quot; it is also a willingness , to fight against religious fundament@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced the vote , religious conflicts may also be registered according to Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wish to stra@@ ining such conflicts in Germany , &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he suggested that translate the basic law on Arabic .
&quot; in future , integration will be a lot more still today than the whole of society . &quot;
&quot; this will also change the majority of society , the elimination of discrimination and racism are pressing . &quot;
Germany has indeed - as a result of European decisions - with a decade @-@ discrimination and a general law of equality
&quot; but it lear@@ ns how the NS@@ U @-@ M@@ ord@@ serie showed , in which police and authorities were systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive . &quot;
equal opportunities for all : what mig@@ rat@@ ory organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white German demand for a long time and are committed to international agreements like the anti @-@ racial prevention of Germany until the country is to remain peacefully and to use its new citizens - for the benefit of all .
&quot; in general , Germany was able to supply the previously expected refugees to have medi@@ cally investigated , said physicians &quot; &quot; said Frank Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; regarding almond and capacity , we create it , &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , it had to flow extra money to the system . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid bot@@ t@@ cy , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , to all line @-@ line , is equal to the registration of health cards . &quot;
the services rendered later could be settled in the federal states later .
&quot; and in the long @-@ term , it is highly questionable , so many people can so@@ ak up with the limited performance catalogue that will see the asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors will primarily make the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; as far as previously , the Berlin Health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are worse in regard to their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in medical offices , interpre@@ ters need to be taken and is calling for them . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees were also helped with more general treatment guidelines in the emergency @-@ department . &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; among refugee camps , for instance , there is much more disabled people , and for the young people it is about HIV education . &quot;
&quot; with the partially of the other diseases of the disease , German doctors were partly supported by their education , but clearly writes Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite dy@@ e or tubercul@@ osis are not difficult to detect . &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have developed a highly developed educational system ; several refugees have even doctors .
&quot; in order to be able to practice , however , they would have to dism@@ iss their qualifications and bl@@ ur@@ ly rate tests . &quot;
at least half of the refugees incoming in Germany depends on the estimates of bund@@ le psych@@ otherap@@ ist ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psych@@ ologically . most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic disorder or depression .
&quot; refugee children , especially vulnerable , explains Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study commissioned by TU München shows that every 5 Syrian refugee camp was trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; anyone who is suffering from a post @-@ trau@@ matic disorder is suffering from among other things such as Flash@@ backs with respiratory distress , ver@@ ti@@ go , cardiovascular and suffering . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms are sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ - and concentration @-@ based problems , strong up@@ sur@@ ability and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent that the symptoms were chronic , be an early treatment needed , explained Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; however , only four percent of psych@@ ologically dise@@ ased refugees have received a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; while psych@@ ic cran@@ ial asylum seek@@ er can face a proposal for psych@@ otherapy , but it usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; moreover , in the social centres in case of non @-@ workers or doctors who are not trained in the psych@@ ic diseases , whether treatment is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this frequently lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites to dream
with the new st@@ aging &quot; Passion &quot; the Circus &quot; bst looks back to the traditions of cir@@ cus .
&quot; the aim is to pull all ages in the spell of amazing ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
&quot; now , the Circus &quot; &quot; Out@@ put &quot; &quot; in the ring on the tile to Dre@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can not imagine without living my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ eb@@ orn and Juni@@ or@@ am . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - this motto is the current manager . &quot;
&quot; for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the family . &quot;
the gift to delight is the family in the blood .
&quot; it is important for us to take away the people from their convention and take them out for two hours into a completely different world , &quot; says the 27 @-@ year junior staff . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with world city flair , &quot; therefore Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst is his concept . &quot;
we can now experience 50 cities in the almost 3 000 km long tour .
the programme of cir@@ cus is convinced by talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown draws the audience with w@@ it and charm in their spell . &quot;
&quot; the Castillo Brothers , understand their craft . &quot;
with the heroes of the dum@@ my films the Cuban duo is going to take up .
eas@@ iness and ag@@ ility - identify with these words they identify themselves .
their humor@@ ous art at the mast should be conqu@@ ering women &apos;s heat over the storm .
&quot; besides through numerous lau@@ ghing : the &quot; &quot; rob@@ atics of Circus &quot; &quot; will also be fascinated with finger@@ tips and ar@@ quit@@ eness . &quot;
balanced with the unic@@ ycle on a bul@@ let ?
for He Yuan is no problem .
slim people fascin@@ ate and fri@@ ghten at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of the ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascin@@ ates with their mot@@ ility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer a variety of diversity .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasises the Mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of Circus are too often the subject of various animal welfare organizations .
&quot; Stephanie Pro@@ bst is also taking place : &quot; it is not good for our animals , it is also not good for us . &quot;
&quot; approximately 80 animals from five different continents and enjoy every stro@@ kes , &quot;
&quot; the four @-@ legged Arti@@ sts , as it is lovingly called , is read by the eyes every wish of the eyes . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel good , it does not want to be in the arena . &quot;
the first commandment is : good for the animals .
&quot; especially on their zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y@@ man and a zeb@@ ra @-@ mare , the family pro@@ clamation is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived together eight years in a enclosure and nothing has happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was here , &quot; told Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is still not ready for the ring , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Krone . &quot;
therefore there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Circus &quot; &quot; will take place from 17 to 20 September daily at 17 p.m. and 8 p.m. to your expectations . &quot;
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
&quot; Thursday is the family day , for the presentation at 5 p.m. , prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , African oldest guide , came down from one podium in the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , the video of the case quickly became more widespread about the social media . &quot;
the opening of parliament was also troubled in claims of parliament &apos;s alleg@@ ations that they would have been received in anonymous bi@@ parti@@ ality and warned that they were sum@@ mon@@ ed by Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ ase .
&quot; during the last month they had spread it , and interrupted it during his speech to the situation of the nation in the parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the spokes@@ man for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese told us that seven Op@@ tional politicians have received SMS messages on their mobile phones , they warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ cking calls . &quot;
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists according to Mu@@ ck &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it war@@ ns the members affected by parliament that the immunity in the Parliament ends , and as soon as they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immunity was no longer effective . &quot;
&quot; chief speaker said that from Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , the party &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; is concerned about the dangers facing politicians . &quot;
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30,000 jobs &quot;
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will likely be to accommodate 25.000 to 30,000 jobs in restruc@@ tur@@ ings and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
HP will be split up later this year into two listed companies and split the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and its service business activities .
&quot; the expected job losses leads to a load of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures are to be a competitive , more sustainable cost @-@ effective infrastructure for the new He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair and Chief Executive , which should direct the unit after separation . &quot;
He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger than it &apos;s HP today and we have a wide and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that help companies to transition to a new style of business . &quot;
&quot; as a stand @-@ alone company , we are better placed than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ 2012 and will be focused on delivering un@@ ri@@ ght@@ fully , integrated technology solutions for businesses &quot; , &quot; says a declaration of the company . &quot;
&quot; it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930@@ s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill He@@ w@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard , to produce electro @-@ plants and the Palo Alto Garage man called &quot; the birthplace of the Sili@@ con Valley . &quot; &quot;
HP has gone a massive restructuring process to tackle the desc@@ ending from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s largest PC manufacturer and one of the biggest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field based on the belief that closely focused on focused on achieving better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ate must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere .
&quot; he stressed more to Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it is until September and when his rehabilitation after the plan goes there , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas . &quot;
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history it will be uncertain of its participation in the next summer at the European Championships .
the great shame on this current issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere has finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le falls and then recovered again to its old cur@@ v@@ ature during the off @-@ season .
&quot; this sort of injury is not threatened the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; it is a bone , who is not good . &quot;
this is no longer a matter .
that was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his K@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries that he had previously had .
&quot; this may be true from purely medical point of view , but like Wen@@ ger also recognized , there are related risk of other injury , always when a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the study conducted by Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has had 23 different illnesses of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut in six years ago .
&quot; he also played in more than 15@@ 7 Lig@@ per &apos;s more than 15@@ 7 Lig@@ per , in the last five times . &quot;
&quot; the wider picture of arsen@@ al is that it has been in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs , who have to record most of the vulner@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability ratio is spread during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a back@@ sli@@ t period , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and gain fight power , &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , and I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of some kind he deserves . &quot;
arsen@@ al begins his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before the Games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ track on Wednesday Wednesday and Wen@@ ger on Wednesday night .
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not come to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta would start to start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the equilibrium and to the players it need@@ ing to get a little break @-@ up , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although Arsenal is a clear favourite , the Mak@@ si@@ mir al stadium in Zagreb is one of the most intimid@@ ations in Europe . &quot;
dynam@@ o is un@@ beaten as well after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has been launched in the last season .
the stadium was shaken to the Tuesday evening by an earthquake that was measured in the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is in the opinion , that arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League of capit@@ ulation and continues to be driven from the distant future with its management to lead the society to its first European apo@@ calyp@@ tic triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; he said . &quot;
it has never worked with arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m far enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not a dre@@ amer . &quot;
Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest : the Com@@ edy show who has made us serious lessons for men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar lay@@ outs in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up now still more desper@@ ate than ever before , such as suicide rates amongst young men could prove to a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ xes ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a ab@@ ject life ) 2015 is the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to ask for help if they need it . &quot;
friendship is the c@@ enter@@ piece in the struggle to resolve this challenge .
&quot; a recent study on more than 2,000 High @-@ School students with depressive symptoms realised that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of indul@@ gence has doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not depressed , a circle of mental healthy friends hal@@ ved the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to have friends only so that a friendship can work .
&quot; in the age of more than social media , communication with its focus on substance on substance is often more important than an un@@ important contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life have doubled the need to be strong , vital and successful , even when in reality the isolation dominates . &quot;
&quot; superf@@ icial success is dominated by the dominates that psych@@ ologists describe ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic value - our inner desire for personal development and friendship which affects our mental health more deeply . &quot;
&quot; and like a video player and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy . &quot;
beautiful with Friends was that this foc@@ ussing on the head has been asked .
&quot; each character was not defined by his work , but defined by his personality , which g@@ lowed through the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; humor from Jo@@ ey and Chand@@ ler Mul@@ ler hu@@ gs , Mom@@ ages at soccer fans in cozy arm@@ chairs and the nostal@@ gia of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowing that men can definitely get back , even if they often stop back to explore their emotions . &quot;
&quot; as a staff of the phone pra@@ ises to me : ... &quot; &quot; my audience &apos;s role for people who feel depressed and su@@ ic@@ iled , has really shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
&quot; the men who contact us , often don &apos;t feel able to talk with friends . &quot;
&quot; the old all@@ usion &quot; &quot; I come along with &quot; &quot; has a tremendous effect as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems openly . &quot;
&quot; friends is one of the shows that come to mind , when I try to offer long @-@ term moving across . &quot;
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ sider status on the phone will also help people in eye @-@ looking face , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you come to Com@@ edy Central Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest with the backdrop to the celebration of the day completely new scenery , why do not take your friends to have a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better , if you can see someone alone in Star@@ bucks you give him a smile and tell him hello . &quot;
you never know what makes your friendship possible .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - all 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Fri@@ end@@ s@@ festival
&quot; di Maria meets to help PS@@ G , Malmö . &quot;
angel Di Maria is celebrating her hits with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and sor@@ son Cav@@ ani following his results on Mal@@ mo@@ e .
&quot; Maria di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G , on Malmö . &quot;
&quot; here are the annual report , and the reaction to the game . &quot;
angel Di Maria and Fran@@ son Cav@@ ani kept the course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 win against Malmö at the Prin@@ par@@ k@@ stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; he met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League dé@@ ties than PS@@ G players who reached the French master the way , but afterwards put a series of opportunities before they finally increased its Vor@@ sprung durch Technik , as Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st Minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A requires a strong start against the Swedish masters , as they not only asp@@ ire the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out laps , but an improvement on the way to the quar@@ ks during each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
but while they got the points it was not a class of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ ya &apos;s odds in front of the gate . he became later in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with which he started his illustr@@ ative career as early as 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or go out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to cause 2 : 0 to cause our opponents to cause problems and relaxed , even if there are certain things that we have still perf@@ ected during the season , &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t yet reached one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; according to his injury , I returned to the Paris team for his injury , which was a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided on the weekend to hold its own place against Bordeaux in the first League , but he was out@@ stretched in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an &apos; guard was designated as the man who continues to take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , when he ran into the last month by Manchester United in the last month before completing his place in Marco Wil@@ and by beautiful in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; however , if anyone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory that was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malmö that struck the lead in a play @-@ off to reach that level joined with nine national champi@@ ons on the field and was a five @-@ man @-@ defense and two deep in the middle @-@ field inter@@ cep@@ ted a heavy opponent . &quot;
&quot; but apart from a shot by Nikola D@@ jur@@ on@@ ics , who went far to Kevin Tr@@ alongside &apos;s P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes gave itself up on , with some mis@@ ses and bad connections , not least of I@@ bra@@ in@@ movi@@ c , who was abandoned at no less than five attempts alone in the first half of p@@ atz@@ inger , then after Cav@@ our did after the rest@@ art . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he proved a lot more skill , when he brought his fellow @-@ players into the game and it was a pass of I@@ bra@@ in@@ movi@@ c , transformed the Di Maria into a set @-@ ray , written by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the P@@ fo@@ sten . &quot;
&quot; the second gate finally fell short after the hours brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . in the Uruguay , he made his sixth wat@@ cher after I@@ bra@@ a got a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; so all the thoughts stop that Malmö can go back to the game and only an excellent intervention of po@@ ke out of the shortest distance to David Lu@@ iz chips to stop David Lu@@ iz chips in order to know the end result , before spare players ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi , recognised the gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G has played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish league , which did not have the same level . &quot;
the Quali@@ fications does not range from . &quot;
hats off for Paris !
there was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi plays for summer 2015 for the al @-@ S@@ add sport Club in Qatar
&quot; the FC Bayern stood obviously just a few years ago just before the commitment of Spain super@@ star X@@ avi , who then played for FC Barcelona at the time . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times Po@@ k@@ si@@ eger , four times champion League Champion , two time champion @-@ champion , two times European champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is stunning . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the now 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi now tells us that he was already standing before departure from Barcelona in June 2008 . &quot;
I told me that Bar@@ ça do not want to sell me .
&quot; Madrid then won everything , we told nothing &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
and the registered association of FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was a offer of Bavaria .
&quot; Rum@@ I , wanted me to have me . &quot;
&quot; to remember : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi does not change
the change did not come about .
and the determining man for this now works for the German record rider : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken under contract , and I have played a great EM . &quot;
&quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change , that he could not imagine the team without me . &quot;
&quot; there@@ with he has master@@ ed me . &quot;

Matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film
Matt Dam@@ on confronted the af@@ ro@@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said they are not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday night from HB@@ OS &apos;s Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown broke out Brown , when the need for alternative prospects prev@@ ailed , in relation to a black protagon@@ ists in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; when we talk about diversity , then do it with the cast of the film and not the cast of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; Brown responded shocked , with abu@@ sive un@@ belief and called &quot; hoo ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian was getting his . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer &apos;s wings Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ic brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask for people to think about - who will always be the director , how to deal with the character of Harmony , &quot; said Brown initially . &quot;
&quot; the single black person , and she is a groove , which is beaten by her white be@@ holding . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People picked up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kr@@ isten Bran@@ c@@ accio for direct rights at the film ; Dam@@ on be@@ ware that their direc@@ ting &quot; &quot; might give something to us , what we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion has been broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded from dis@@ approval via dam@@ on comments . &quot;
&quot; Mr Po@@ oni expressed his rage about the clip , saying &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their variety - this is SO MU@@ I that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; Twe@@ et possessed with over 5,000 re@@ ets and 4,000 sq@@ kes since its publication . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the accurate rac@@ ist representation is in the media at the top of the social dialogue .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white poli@@ cem@@ an , the movement of Black Li@@ ves joined nation@@ wide and crow@@ ned leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to face any forms of discrimination against colour @-@ oriented law . &quot;
in February the vo@@ cal@@ ist Prince made an all@@ usion to the movement during the introduction of the nom@@ inees of the year at Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album quiet Zermatt , &quot; ( albums are still their meaning ) said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black lives , they still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in more recent times , leaders of the Movement of Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter have published an explanation and in response to the question of the Fox @-@ News @-@ personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be viewed as a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of entertainment , producers and media groups , who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the portra@@ yal of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he took the invitation or met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Ninja Warrior &apos; crow@@ ned first Champion
professional sports@@ man and operator assistant Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior in the Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of 1 million Euros .
&quot; the contest show , which had just completed her 7th season , had never experienced a competition winner who could complete all stages of its obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season @-@ finals , there are two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten to the finals . &quot;
the Cli@@ mb@@ ing part of the last task was on a 75 @-@ hour walk @-@ in for 30 second .
&quot; Brit@@ ten ended the task within the time , with which he was the first athlete and finished the first ath@@ let phase 4 of the American Ninja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero concluded that challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero speaking with E ! messages after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under shock above the profit of the big prize of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about this , I have never earned more than 10,000 $ or about life , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap money . &quot;
so all sudden .. as I can not even imagine how that is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood re@@ porters to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first ended the course , not just any prize money . &quot;
&quot; however , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alists , one gets the fastest time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
how much the money is a wonderful price and the life changed ; he receives the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he has any res@@ ent@@ ment about it .
he is just so fortunate to have done what he has done .
masses of awards he received from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family @-@ father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I was to be beaten by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot;
&quot; and I think Isaac would have just felt the same , if they were exchanged the roles . &quot;
&quot; America Ninja Warrior was extended to an A@@ bo@@ ay season , the filming will begin in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers past Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ POL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; formerly they once were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers have been reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but these part played a perfect place on Tuesday to discuss the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 target @-@ target . &quot;
the T@@ wins launched a chance to climb within a half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card @-@ Platz .
&quot; Detroit , though only for one evening , was it a return of the three letter F word which was so difficult to sum up over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories will be fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers , Brad Bo@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; tiger Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon held its early offensive support , when it dot@@ ted three times in the first two tracks , once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) suggested 6 times to the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and made three runs .
it was his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year seriously , &quot; said Simon . &quot;
it is hard to throw in the Bull@@ ring of any game and so I want to fully concentrate in the game .
&quot; the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ us , his first R@@ IS since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first triple hit play by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he held four hits by the Seattle nav@@ ers last July . &quot;
&quot; it has the drums , well curved , &quot; &quot; said precip@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the bull@@ ring and he saw it straight out in the bull@@ ring , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ uns at the back@@ yard end of the seventh race , T@@ wins had the best chance to come back into play . &quot;
in the Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton concluded the inning with a double in the left field .
&quot; Right Fiel@@ ding Aaron H@@ icks arrived a B@@ unt , and Simon produced his second bas@@ eman Brian Du@@ cian to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the Link@@ sh@@ ing Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; har@@ dy ran like wall , the only man to face with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated R@@ ookie R@@ ookie , Miguel S@@ ano , who has caught a two @-@ Run of the right @-@ handed . &quot;
with a pair of runners and the finale @-@ run of the second brought Ver@@ hagen to the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double Play .
&quot; it was the major second time this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe suggested a double play . &quot;
&quot; after Detroit added a Insurance Run at the end of the ninth , there were a R@@ BI guy against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don , and achieved the state of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the Ri@@ gi@@ ver Dam viol@@ ates S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for its fifth mark . &quot;
Detroit wei@@ gh@@ ed to the start of the game by an even not moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the tiger achieved three runs in the first two Inn@@ es against the right @-@ handed piano that was cancelled in front of the game of the vulner@@ ability list , having been missing more than a month ago . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I have wished for , &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; but I felt better than I wanted to release and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches out there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after they got in the first off the Le@@ ad@@ ow @-@ Bat@@ ter , H@@ ushes made a single to second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
a two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to the game who won a single &quot; up the abs@@ middle . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 track series with the r@@ une in the sc@@ oring position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman of Nick Castell@@ are followed with a single on the right side , managed to run a further run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game than he tried to go to third what the threat was finished . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers laid on the second to be an One @-@ Out double of Cat@@ cher James McC@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ osis for 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; it was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul mol@@ itor . &quot;
he was not very well beaten but he caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was located in a Pit@@ ch @-@ Count which had no points in the third inning before it was replaced by the Rel@@ ever spelling @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ ad .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es we came up to three R@@ uns in six hits and one walk with four k@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ chez provided that there were a violation of the throw @-@ f@@ ow@@ ter .
&quot; he is studied by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who has operated the S@@ án@@ chez in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; San@@ chez , since the middle of August on the vulner@@ ability list , should be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is removed from the vulner@@ ability list to start the T@@ wins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at 4 starters with the Tig@@ ers since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he was missing from 20 August because of a de@@ x@@ tion in the right @-@ wing wr@@ ist .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games on target field on Wednesday .
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4@@ 43 ER@@ A ) is to be played against min@@ ut@@ ana R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) . &quot;
hundreds of refugees are supposed to come up in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on their way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected on Wednesday night on Wednesday .
&quot; the disabled people in this case are to be accommod@@ ated in emergency accommodation in Wiesbaden , as the City of Wiesbaden on Tuesday night . &quot;
you reck@@ oned with 450 up to 750 to 750 to incoming refugees .
several gy@@ ms of the H@@ ess@@ ische Landes@@ Capital were well prepared in recent days for this case .
up to 1000 refugees can come temporarily there .
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
&quot; alone in the past ten days , according to the initial government of the government , G@@ ießen 7@@ 500 people had already arrived in H@@ esse . &quot;
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have set up a large number of refugees with refugees in sports facilities for the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
&quot; the head of Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German participation in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe the resol@@ ute thinking about military options in action must not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he threw out the European states &quot; collective over@@ look . &quot;
four years ago we were glad that the cup of military participation in Germany has been passing .
&quot; now the conflict landed in front of our front door , &quot; he said in the Deutsch@@ land@@ funk . &quot;
the former German Ambassador in Washington also called for massive increase of international aid to refugees .
Austria controlled at the southern and eastern borders
Austria once again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders .
&quot; the Austrian Minister of Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner stated on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station OR@@ F , but no one will be sent back . &quot;
Germany did not send any refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , that is agreed , &quot; she stated . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question about an agreement , after which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria every day , &quot; &quot; said Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , I have already provided the discussions between the Director General for Public Safety and representatives of Germany . &quot;
concrete figures did not mention them and referred to discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
in the past few days tens of thousands of refugees came across the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ ian from Hungary to Austria .
your goal is mostly Germany .
chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann applied for a discussion with several other EU heads of state and government on a special summit next week .
Germany had started on Sunday with a temporary border control .
the EU Member States have not yet to agree to a common course in the crisis .
the EU ministers want to take on a special schedule to the binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees on the next Tuesday ( 22nd September ) .
&quot; given the strong refugee population in Germany , the federal government wants to support the federal government and the distribution of people more strongly . &quot;
&quot; together with the Coun@@ tries , this was announced in the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultation with the Prime Minister in the law office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel stressed , for those people who need protection , proclaim this too . &quot;
&quot; but who doesn &apos;t have a lead , could not stay in Germany too . &quot;
this idea had been expressed in the hand in the hand .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now face a &quot; huge power exer@@ tion . &quot;
thousands of desper@@ ate refugees are now stuck in the Baltic Sea route .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia on the night of Tuesday .
a few hours later the government was announced in Budapest also the border to Romania with a fence .
this neighboring land is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent any tu@@ g ev@@ ils about Romania and said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to to the planned new border .
the Romanian government convic@@ ted the Plan immediately .
there were the first ar@@ rests of people having the fence .
because in Turkey the eyes of the e@@ ye@@ asts were reported to offer thousands of migrants on their way to the Greek border .
&quot; fighters &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds the ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
the E@@ disp@@ an@@ zer of Satur@@ nia Ex@@ cel@@ ad@@ us was a global ocean .
this researchers from observations by the &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; Cass@@ ini .
&quot; therefore , the moon is easily ten@@ sion@@ ed upon its ring around the ring pl@@ anners . &quot;
&quot; this diving movement is only small , but it is too great for a permanent celestial body , in a communication of the Cor@@ nell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US @-@ State New York ) . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; journal .
even longer was known that it has to be under the ice @-@ ceiling of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us liquid water .
&quot; so , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; already discovered ice @-@ hurri@@ can@@ es in 2006 by the South Pole of Saturn , the water vap@@ or and ice @-@ particles and therefore feed the so @-@ called e @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the south pole it had to give an underground sea , we closed the astronom@@ ers at that time . &quot;
the expansion of the hidden ocean was not yet clear .
Rama is missing for a number of weeks in Munich
the day in Munich is without having to give up a month in the German artist Val@@ ves .
an investigation has resulted in an ad@@ duc@@ tion of the 27 @-@ year @-@ old and shared the association .
Rama had already compl@@ ained about pain in the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to the Munich Lion , the diagnosis &quot; is expected to break four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; that is hard for us , Rama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot;
&quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; said Sport@@ SEC@@ U@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper with a view of the possible obligation of un@@ true professionals . &quot;
&quot; however , as training surface the six@@ ties did first create a defensive . &quot;
the 30 year old H@@ r@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was recently active in Belgium and was also responsible for the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg under contract .
the Kro@@ ate currently has the ability to test his ability .
Tor@@ j@@ äger Ru@@ bin Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return into the team training after its bra@@ ins .
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian nation @-@ player should step into the training . &quot;
Ok@@ ot@@ ie has viol@@ ated his head on the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) .
&quot; contrary to the very first fears , however , it remained without a serious bl@@ ur . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
&quot; but he who wants to pay attention to their slender line , is often discour@@ aged by them . &quot;
because man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar - above all su@@ cro@@ se .
&quot; healthy , the exotic fruits are nevertheless : in them they contain B vitamins , as well as the vitamins E and C. In particular , Man@@ gos but many vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor is beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; he who e@@ ats the fruit , thus supports visual force , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ goes do not go too soft or too strong and be comfortable . &quot;
the form@@ work color alone tells nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so you can taste green man@@ gos delicious .
they are available to store at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
then they taste of course pure or in sweet foods .
&quot; however , a man@@ go also gives heart @-@ loving dishes a special touch . &quot;
they allevi@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of man@@ tle like chi@@ or@@ ee and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
&quot; a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney is well suited to fish , poultry , lamb and ven@@ ison . &quot;

&quot; on Thursday morning until Thursday morning he will bring us a marked cold @-@ front , which brings heavy rains , wind @-@ bows and a temperature drop . &quot;
&quot; like Met@@ e@@ o@@ News , Switzerland is currently writing on the front of a broad low @-@ pressure field over the British Is@@ les in a strong south @-@ west . &quot;
on the nightmare side the night will break through the valleys .
as a result the hair @-@ hair th@@ eh@@ n until Thursday morning in the F@@ öh@@ n@@ onic hills with bucks of 60 to 100 km / h ; isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partially also with over 100 km / h .

&quot; here , rain is taking one , until Thursday night . &quot;
&quot; in sum , south of the Alps must be calculated in the next 48 hours with some 100 liters of rain per square meter , which have fallen large rain sets over the last few days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning F@@ öh@@ ler goes on the air and then rolls out a cold @-@ front with a vigor@@ ous , partial cl@@ ed rain from west to east via Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; together with the cold weather the wind pic@@ ks heavily up to stor@@ my , and the temperatures rise clearly . &quot;
&quot; the following days are in the north end of autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south on the other hand it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther Square
just 500 years after the Reformation there is now a Martin @-@ Luther place in Rome .
in the presence of the President Ig@@ na@@ zio Marino was born on Wednesday another well @-@ known place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill on the name of the German Re@@ former Re@@ former .
at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now honored as a &quot; German The@@ ologist of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the ancient Rome right next to the Colos@@ seum .
the nam@@ ing had been sought by the work of evangel@@ ical Chur@@ ches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often live only in conce@@ aled their faith . &quot;
&quot; in symbo@@ lically , the place of the Christian faith in Rome is visible . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was held as a young August@@ inian monk at the end of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 some months in Rome .
he felt the city at that time as a comm@@ union ba@@ bel .
his negative impressions were encouraged to have emp@@ ow@@ ered him with the view of historians in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then directed his thes@@ es against the di@@ as@@ sh@@ an@@ del the split in the Church of the Church .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ pl@@ ated ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main pieces that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post has updated the introduction and Bible texts updated .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible that is now released with signature pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the image of Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 motives has formulated his quite personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means equivalent to &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
&quot; on the contrary , according to the respective subjects , that may quite be quite gri@@ m . &quot;
&quot; over three years Ot@@ mar Alt has been working on his Bible project , for which he has met a subjective and artistic selection from the many themes of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these are cycles that dedic@@ ate topics such as cru@@ cis , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or father@@ land . &quot;
he was also fascinated by several partners : this is valid for the Luther Verlag with his the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his focus on art books .
&quot; and here is especially the author Klaus Al@@ te@@ post , who has concerns itself on the basis of the painting with the respective Bible locations . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the scriptures from Ot@@ mar Alt selected Bible study , and thus translated into today &apos;s current relations . &quot;
these texts are as verbal mirror of al@@ ts painting .
&quot; nestled among the original Bible quote , Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who wrote his personal thoughts in the respective situation here . &quot;
the neck@@ lace has golden letters .
so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allowed us to gain twice a deep insight into his soul and his emotions .
this is a high degree of intimacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately caused for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode , and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Moravian Herr@@ n@@ hate Dec@@ or@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; since the education has happened again with the pipe , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I tried to work up , so that we might return to the Lord with the Lord . &quot;
&quot; his second purpose is to get back more significance to art in the shortest time : &quot; &quot; the perception of image moti@@ fs is shaped by complaint today , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being pushed out there .
artists have a different desire and desire to show things .
images always have something secre@@ tive and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a dinosau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt would like to reveal the viewer into the pictures &quot; &quot; into them &quot; , &quot; to discover and feel the power they have : &quot; &quot; the picture looks for his counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Al@@ te@@ post stolen in Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar Alt @-@ Alt , in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Oth@@ mar Al@@ ts &quot; art : &quot; I like how he understands his life with his paintings . &quot;
&quot; neither consider the Bible to fully capture the Bible , but those selected for him important and mysterious . &quot;
&quot; this was not working on the eye level , &quot; says Al@@ te@@ post : &quot; here it is all the pictures , the text explained only . &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler , Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to immer@@ se his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for car@@ rots both ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas knowledge - is presented for the first time in an exhibition which will be opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar Alt @-@ Foundation .
commen@@ cement for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
&quot; made plans , place was commissioned , the be@@ a@@ ws for an excursion mod@@ eled : a year later was almost all done - but still before the official opening of the BM@@ X track was already close . &quot;
om@@ issions in politics and administration provided for exp@@ uss but especially in residents who do not toler@@ ate the railway .
&quot; so hill de@@ ported , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building license . &quot;
the approval will enter in October and was able to inform the first @-@ group of Sabine Mo@@ se@@ bach @-@ Bo@@ ck at the Children &apos;s and youth committee now .
&quot; I hope this year has happened to be more visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; no &quot; &quot; pillar &quot; &quot; with the work of the former co@@ coa . &quot;
DF@@ B intensified commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ D also extends its commitment to refugees from 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga continues on the weekend as a clear sign . &quot;
the football respon@@ ds to the state in Germany and secur@@ es politics his aid in addressing the upcoming problems .
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country , since the reunion . &quot;
&quot; there can be no one in principle that nothing goes to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; you will need to get any interest you get involved in the handle , &quot; said DF@@ B @-@ boss Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at 23 September in Berlin he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am next Wednesday at the law office and meet the Secretary of State in Ms E@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football could and wants to help .
but the crucial cros@@ sover must be politics .
the German soccer league therefore has step@@ ped up its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; four years .
&quot; we have ensured that the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation is ensured that this program runs until 2019 , &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach , on the edge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
even some Bundes@@ liga support this program .
already at this weekend the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ ages are placing an important sign when they are on the left tri@@ cot@@ ics instead of the otherwise usual sponsor@@ ers ( Her@@ mes ) - the imprint &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should and how they can only , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen @-@ chef Ru@@ di Fi@@ ghter the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) , and illustrated the project as &quot; self @-@ comprehen@@ sion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee @-@ drama goes every day , no one must take away . &quot;
&quot; we can state football , no , we must use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ ash@@ hei@@ ms Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of an &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot;
Euro 2016 quali@@ fier against Hungary on this Friday the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
Ni@@ ers@@ bach described support for refugees as &quot; a large joint work of German football . &quot;
&quot; that all of the 36 licens@@ ing projects have started in their location , be magnificent . &quot;
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; the message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; which we spent will live in football . &quot;
&quot; it is of immense importance , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; this and the next year the association , together with the DF@@ B and Government , represents 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the associations have already called for the whole sum of 2015 , &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;

&quot; during an accident at the staircase in the house of his brother in the USA , he had fallen into a water glass after midnight that he was carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; economic &quot; week &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost ble@@ ached , it was power@@ less , then dropped off onto the road - he told us last week , &quot; cited as the &quot; Wi@@ ck &apos;s &quot; SAP @-@ founder H@@ asso Platt@@ ner . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could pursue his work .
&quot; in early October we meet before the board direc@@ ting at Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the 54 year old manager was in the meeting and &quot; &quot; full of work &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday morning ) and he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to develop the software group .
&quot; I &apos;m full of SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in a regular contact with the Supervis@@ ory Board and its chairman H@@ asso Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually runs between Germany and the US , since the summer he was not anymore in the German SAP Head@@ quarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important for him to go to the public with such a personal story , said the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everyone can happen as something like that . &quot;
&quot; important is to be found again , if you have gone up . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot opus beyond skir@@ mish ...
&quot; left an appropriate photo and said , he suffered this injury , as he was over@@ thrown by wheel . &quot;
&quot; he therefore arrives in Singapore at the weekend as little as a reserve for the two St@@ am@@ mp@@ il@@ ot Fernando Al@@ onso and J@@ enson Button , just like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
football : B@@ VB without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : gra@@ den@@ cy in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ us@@ sia , everybody hopes to finally hit a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group of the Europe League . &quot;
the national player will be missing the Tab@@ ular leader of the soccer league in Du@@ eling with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 h / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately , we can no longer attack on him , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be back in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , but the B@@ NB would be open : &quot; we reck@@ on with a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ cum@@ ber will not only change its ancest@@ or position only on the prec@@ inct . &quot;
he announced a change on the door@@ keepers .
&quot; therefore , Roman Wei@@ den@@ cy takes the place of the art@@ ender Roman brushes . &quot;
&quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; praised the football teacher to the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; Wei@@ den@@ trust in future has been used in all Europe league games , however , has been open to Tu@@ chel . &quot;
he will also move the second game with a high amount of probability .
&quot; the expl@@ orer statement of fellow @-@ players rep@@ us that the final one for the B@@ VB in the Europe League must be the target , holding intermediate @-@ fel@@ b@@ player Julian W@@ eig@@ l for understandable : &quot; therefore , Marco is not that wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to take the title . &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants the for@@ erun@@ ner for Germany
Germany should be the only pioneer in the change of the car in the course of the action of the federal government in the course of the action of the car .
&quot; the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strateg@@ ical paper from the house of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things fores@@ aw the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the N@@ esse IA@@ A by a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
automated driving and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less stress - Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said .
he wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries to come together with representatives of the industry .
the strategic paper of the Federal Ministry of Commerce also emphasises the importance of the mobile broad@@ band construction and a rapid decline to digital radio .
there is currently a test line on the motorway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; in order to allow the driver to &quot; no additional liability risks , &quot; the federal government wants to review the legal framework conditions and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Germany is about to use internationally recognised that the permitted maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is up@@ lifted from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government also wants to actively promote a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only seen the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; automated driving takes over increasingly the car the leadership , the driver will get more and more a passenger . &quot;
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that record the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs ( automated driving will be possible technically possible by 2020 ) .
&quot; nevertheless , cars are expected to be expected on public roads &quot; only far after 2020 . &quot;
the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the high @-@ automation capabilities at the location of Germany appreciate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to approximately 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the CH@@ P can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; said the SPD @-@ policy poster S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in incidents and security of personal data of the drivers must be un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clari@@ fied . &quot;
but the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still skep@@ tical - much more than the French or Americans .
&quot; an on Wednesday at the AA remaining pol@@ l of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the audit of the DE@@ K@@ RA will believe that only 8 percent of Germans believe that self @-@ prop@@ elled cars will continue to en@@ force in the next ten years , 32 percent do not count at all in 20 years , 31 per cent did not believe at all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of the respon@@ dents up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous cars , the US 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a collecting of the digital unit , only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the entire route on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway , that can be seen in the flowing traffic after at least 15 per cent , at the St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
good anyone interested in the car would not be left to the car under any circumstances .
bol@@ l says team and double @-@ start at table tennis @-@ EM
Düssel@@ dor@@ fer wants to present at the front stand with the title from 25 September to 4 October only in the single .
the final decision will be handed down at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough , even without Timo for fetch the title , &quot; said Bund@@ est@@ ra@@ iner Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the EM @-@ year in Düsseldorf . &quot;
Bol@@ l was at that point on the flight to a long @-@ term pension appointment in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; without Timo it is a draw@@ back , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; said single @-@ European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; Ham@@ el@@ ner who performs the S@@ etz@@ als in Ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , but also remembered the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; well , Timo was also missing , and we have become European champion . &quot;
&quot; this is why we should be oriented , &quot; explained the world leader . &quot;
the English football @-@ player Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United has added a serious injury to the right leg .
&quot; in the Champions League play at the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven , the defen@@ ders was taken with a tac@@ kling of H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Moreno and replaced after a long treatment . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant
it is a mix of quite large fashion show and a wa@@ x@@ works cab@@ al : designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich on Wednesday .
the highlights : window man@@ nequ@@ ins who can look terri@@ bly even due to video@@ projection .
&quot; you can take the spectacular creations from the French designer , who among others with Mad@@ onn@@ ese stages has been the big star of the fashion scene - and that he puts men in the tube . &quot;
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant at the Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; it used to be so easy , in the meantime it &apos;s real , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk to The Cat@@ walk &quot; &quot; ( From the pav@@ ement to the drive ) , which has been seen from 18 September to the Kuns@@ thalle at the Hyp@@ o Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a bit of luck that the fashion designer himself has changed its first lesson in a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; but actually he was against it , because : &quot; for me , an exhibition was a bit &apos; death &apos; , &quot; he said . &quot;
when you die comes into the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made the Montreal and Paris station in Canada .
&quot; it &apos;s all about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the Director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ alp . &quot;
&quot; it is a question of tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into this barely at the present work of the man , the world &apos;s history , without ever an education completed . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ological the vision is not constructed , but it is a great chore@@ ographer T@@ art@@ works , designed for the great deal of work : to fr@@ ze the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was committed . &quot;
&quot; 14 tons of material , the makers of the cur@@ ator according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot moved to Munich . &quot;
shortly before the start of the October it was still a special treat : a le@@ der@@ h@@ osen @-@ out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
he is always interested in strong women ( women are smar@@ ter than men ) and for people who are a bit different - said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
fo@@ unds of old Teddy is also visible in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , timi@@ d University attempts of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he has attracted to his Teddy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; playing a doll , his parents could not have allowed him . &quot;
t@@ opp@@ ings of fashion he then joined himself later .
he was making fashion magazines and watched the dra@@ fts of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought it as natural .
for his first own fashion show he did not pay the mod@@ els .
&quot; they got nothing , but we were allowed to keep the cl@@ ots . &quot;
Jewel@@ ry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze as fashion @-@ niche
there used to be one of the long sti@@ ckers in and around pl@@ ys to make meters .
the embro@@ i@@ dered fabrics and peaks have ar@@ isen in large quantities for customers that they processed as blankets and she@@ ers .
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the gran@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; instead , the fashion is again important . &quot;
in the beginning times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze has played a larger role and was then pushed away through the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ ter and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : top in jewelry , with accessories like bags and at regional dishes . &quot;
&quot; this is the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which drives themselves to past cost@@ le@@ po@@ chen , an increasing number of order . &quot;
anyone who has no niche in the textile industry in Germany are no longer served on the market .
with us they already have half of all orders .
Mo@@ gran@@ ule Pl@@ auen is a member of the industry @-@ association of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ ckers .
only they are allowed to carry the protected label .
&quot; over the last 15 years , about 80 percent of its sales generated are being de@@ cel@@ ed . &quot;
private stores and also wholesale trade are available almost any more .
&quot; however , our products reach our customers on this path hardly any further . &quot;
mass @-@ produced nowadays is much cheaper in the Asian region and is almost driven out of chains .
&quot; as well , weak@@ est of export , current to Russia and to the USA . &quot;
enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; industry association seeks to score points through environmental awareness , such as Cord@@ ula Bauer was declared by the sti@@ f@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; since then , we conduct a quality force , which shows that we are ec@@ ologically and socially arable . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; it also refers to the used materials .
&quot; designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger out@@ si@@ ders of the West@@ phal@@ ia University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the faculty for applied arts , and is specialized in embro@@ ider@@ ies and tips . &quot;
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region one needs to find high quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the firms that have to think above all economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly different to hold a customer base . &quot;
a couple of years ago re@@ designed textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter re@@ uter the historical snow@@ ball tip .
sti@@ cking the machine on a few places small cows .
&quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold smith &apos;s master@@ ed in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ lets was inspired by this : &quot; &quot; before , I was able to do nothing with traditional pl@@ au@@ ener . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in an elaborate process they shapes the patterns in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify with the theme of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies the USA , Australia and Finland - mainly to customers who have lived in Pl@@ auen and surroundings and want to have a mem@@ ento . &quot;
&quot; in this way , I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador to the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
Disney plan new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
&quot; you should not touch , but Disney still dar@@ es to create a new movie of his classics &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; according to the &quot; Entertainment Weekly , &quot; however , it is not a curiosity , but a kind of continuation , which takes 20 years after the first film with the magical n@@ anny . &quot;
it is about the experience of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks in the times of the global economic crisis in England .
who is more than 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; but the director is already fixed : Rob Marshall , most recently with &quot; In@@ to the Woods &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI far@@ es to open the economy wide for the world
&quot; the economy has to open wide to the outside to promote growth , said President of Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group that was commissioned with the steering of the reform . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; China should aim to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start , &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central leadership group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; to promote new @-@ ups and make reforms forward , new cur@@ v@@ ature and vitality is to bring about new space for economic growth , &quot; said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the leadership @-@ group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative comment on the outcome of the market access , relaxation of the border checks policy , to take in private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the residents of the citizens . &quot;
&quot; according to the statement , a negative list is created to identify the sectors and businesses that do not come into question for investments . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance , since it provides a major role in the healing division of resources , ensuring a constitutional state of business and designed the market open , &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; the government will also lo@@ osen inspec@@ tions to the powers transferred , and make sure that companies decide how to control their business . &quot;
&quot; the statement also said that China will allow China border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border business operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth . &quot;
&quot; open on an offer , state controlled sectors , additional areas will be opened for private investments . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the ri@@ ghtful interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; moreover , it will be easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit , or &quot; Green Card &quot; by facilit@@ ating the requirements and of the application process . &quot;
&quot; the right of pro@@ secut@@ ors guarantee their activity , and professional judges and pro@@ secut@@ ors ; was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
&quot; at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ en@@ ang and became important leaders as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as reported in a statement announced after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double Mercury @-@ limit in carni@@ vor@@ es
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large carni@@ vor@@ es and consumers thus significantly higher dose of nervous .
&quot; consumer F@@ ood@@ watch focuses on an appropriate work@@ paper of the EU , cri@@ tici@@ zed the plans ( &quot; risks and side effects of indu@@ bit@@ ing and inf@@ ant ) , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt believed to have the limit values of the nerve tone for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ ks or s@@ word@@ fish , from an on two milli@@ gram @-@ mer@@ cury per kil@@ os of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , major predat@@ ory fish are now so heavily loaded with mer@@ cury , that on the basis of the current limits , approximately 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches are not allowed to be sold . &quot;
after dou@@ bling the limit values would only be 14.@@ 5 percent in@@ comprehensible .
&quot; in return for this relaxing , the EU wants to get the threshold values of other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ gram of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ood@@ watch recognis@@ es this as &quot; trick &quot; because little cem@@ eter@@ ia , such as car@@ p are usually so low as low as the planned peak values are already made . &quot;
&quot; the lowering in Kl@@ einf@@ o was therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de sequ@@ en@@ ver &quot; that helps the economy of &quot; , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
Mercury is one for the people of high @-@ toxic heavy metals with good attention on the food chain especially in predat@@ ory fish .
&quot; the German government , therefore , is warning that &quot; even small quantities are used especially in the &quot; &quot; natives of the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the federal state Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the current limits , however , that an &quot; health danger to the general population &quot; should not be expected . &quot;
Mercury is mainly caused by coal @-@ burning in the environment .
the German coal @-@ fired power plants de@@ cks according to a written information of the German Federal Ministry for Co@@ oper@@ atives by the Green Bund@@ est@@ ag@@ sab@@ otage Ba@@ er@@ buck more than six tons of mer@@ cury per year from two thirds of the total amount of gold in Germany .
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish is approximately in Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; Perman@@ ently and blan@@ ket , &quot; the &quot; mirror &quot; was quoted in March from the paper . &quot;
last year all @-@ long warnings from mer@@ cury in fish was already one of the most common health risks in the EU war@@ n@@ system R@@ AS@@ FF .
