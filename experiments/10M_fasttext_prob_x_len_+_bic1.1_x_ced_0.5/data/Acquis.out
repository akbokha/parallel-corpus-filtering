&quot; each state , opposite the organization , including its assets , funds and funds , as well as their inspec@@ tors and other officials , the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the pre @-@ tax and exemp@@ tions of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures after this Convention will be terminated in respect to core material , when the community and the organization has been dil@@ uted that the material is consumed or in a way that it has become a nuclear activity , which is not usable or practically non @-@ recur@@ ring . &quot;
the community noti@@ fies the organization according to the implementation of this agreement the transfer of nuclear material from the states that is subjected to the securing measures after this agreement .
&quot; the securing measures after this Convention will end in respect to core materials as soon as the receiving state , as in this agreement , is assumed responsibility . &quot;
&quot; the organization performs documents , from which any data transfer and , if necessary , the re@@ application of the securing measures are highlighted . &quot;
&quot; nuclear materials that are subject to non @-@ nuclear activities , such as production of alloys or ceramic , should be used , so the community with the organization of such as material may be used , under which circumstances the securing measures can be terminated on this material in respect to this material . &quot;
II ) that the corne@@ al material is not used during the non @-@ application of non @-@ application safety according to this agreement for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear forces .
B ) The organization and the Community meet a regulation that the securing measures can only be used in this agreement as long as the core material is used in such an activity .
&quot; in the regulation , as far as possible , how long and under which circumstances these securing measures will not be applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the securing measures will be applied once again , as soon as the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
the organization will be held by the overall amount and composition of this in the state or the state of such materials from this state or the states on the current state .
&quot; this explains their understanding as quickly as possible ; it extends on matters such as time @-@ time and proce@@ dur@@ ations for reporting , but does not include a cheap or secret protection regarding military activity and does not refer to the following use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states contribute to the cost of each of them in their respective obligations under implementation of their respective obligations . &quot;
&quot; the community , the States , or persons , are subject to the organization of their test@@ ament , are re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed , as a result of a special consideration of the organization , the organization will be re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organization contributes to the costs of all additional measurements and sampling schemes , provided by inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states make sure that the liability for nu@@ kle@@ ar damage , including insurance or other financial security , can be taken in accordance with the organisation and their officials to carry out this convention in the same way as the citizens of the United States . &quot;
&quot; each claim that the community or a state is opposite to the organisation or the organization against the community or a state for damages - with the exception of damages from a nuclear inter@@ medi@@ ation - which resulted from the implementation of the securing measures after this agreement , is regulated in line with international law . &quot;
&quot; according to the exam , the Council decides to be submitted by the General Director @-@ General information that the organization has to be con@@ ferred by checking account for nuclear weapons or other nuclear war@@ heads , it can also be transferred to Article X@@ II para C of the stat@@ ute reports and eventually taken to the appropriate measures . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council , in which mass was obtained through the applied securing measures , and provides the community or the state - as far as each of the two contra@@ ctual parties - as far as each of the two contra@@ ctual parties - every representative opportunity to grant the necessary safety . &quot;
&quot; in search of the organization , the community or a state , consultations are held on questions which result from the design or application of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the states are entitled to seek , therefore , because questions that come from the design or application of this agreement will be evaluated . &quot;
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in the relief of such questions by the Council .
&quot; with the exception of disp@@ utes agreed to a conclusion of the Council to Article 19 or one of the Council &apos;s coun@@ ties , which will emerge from the organisation or application of this agreement , which will not be agreed on request by a party of arbit@@ ral tribunal , which consists of five arbit@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the states are ren@@ aming two arbit@@ rators , the organization also names two arbit@@ rators , and the four so @-@ called refer@@ ee chose a fifth , who ch@@ aired the chair@@ manship . &quot;
&quot; have the community and the States , or the organization within three days after the application for an arbit@@ ration request not ever named , the community or the organisation will seek the President of the International Court of Justice to ap@@ point these arbit@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; the same procedure is to be applied , if cancelled within three days after the nam@@ ing or appointment of the fourth arbit@@ rators of the fifth arbit@@ rators have not yet been elected . &quot;
&quot; a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court is ste@@ pless , and all decisions require the consent of at least three arbit@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; decisions of the arbit@@ ral tribunal are binding for the organization , the community and the affected states . &quot;
&quot; a ) This Convention occurs for non @-@ core arm rates , the contra@@ ctual party of the Treaty , and members of the Community , in force , i ) if the state is noti@@ fied by the organization that its procedures are concluded for entry into force of this Convention and &quot;
&quot; II ) When the organisation is noti@@ fied , that it is able to apply their securing measures in relation to these state for the purposes of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organization , the community and the States cons@@ ul@@ ted each other on one of the contra@@ ctual parties over a change of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the consent of the organization , the community and the States . &quot;
C ) The general director teaches all member states of the organization immediately by any change of this agreement .
&quot; a ) This Convention takes place in force , in which the organization of the Community and the States receives the written Noti@@ fication , that its procedures are completed for entry into force . &quot;
B ) This agreement remains as long as strength such as the Treaty of the Treaty .

&quot; the purpose of this part of the Convention is , which , in order to implement the provisions of the partial I on securing measures , as required . &quot;
the goal of securing measures in this agreement is the tim@@ ely discovery of a significant number of nuclear material for the manufacture of nuclear nuclear weapons and other nuclear arsen@@ als for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear arsen@@ ic for the risk of dying from the risk of early discovery .
&quot; to use the target in Article 28 , the material accounting will be used as backup measure of basic meaning , verb@@ al and observation as an important supplem@@ entary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical conclusion of the re@@ iter@@ ation by the organization takes place through an explanation , in which for any material image area which is not listed for a specific period of material amounts under indication of the accuracy limits for the specified me@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; in implementing their test tests , the organization makes an article 3 full use of the community &apos;s security system . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the Community for nuclear materials in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material zones .
&quot; in the use of their securing measures , the Community of de Pro@@ cedure and Meas@@ ures shall make the following kind of use and , as far as required , fore@@ seen how they are getting closer and functional services are : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of frag@@ mented , packed , lost , lost or in other ways from the inventory of core material and inventory ; &quot;
B ) assessment of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and assessment of measurement un@@ certainty ;
&quot; C ) Proce@@ dures for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recei@@ vers ; &quot;
E ) procedures for evaluation of accumulation non @-@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol and reporting system , which shows for each material image zone the core material and the changes of this region including a - and outputs of the material image zone ; &quot;
&quot; g ) Pre@@ ferences , ensure that the book procedures and agreements are done correctly ; &quot;
h ) methods for the refund of reports to the organisation in line with the articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures after this agreement does not extend to material in mining or in the ore processing .
&quot; B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ ori@@ um@@ erable material that has not yet been achieved by letter c ) , the Community of the Organization made the amount and composition of the material , if it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nu@@ kle@@ ar purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) the core material , which is based on composition and purity for the fuel production or the process phase , which is manufactured , or will this core material or other , in a later phase of the core com@@ bu@@ ck @-@ run core material in the States , so it is subject to the other in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; a ) In this agreement , the securing measures shall be terminated for core material below the requirements in Article 11 , however , the community , however , is not possible to control the recovery of nuclear materials that is not possible or desired , such as the organization and the community for each other than the application of suitable safety measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) In this agreement , securing measures are terminated for core material below the requirements specified in Article 13 to determine the organization and the community , that this core material is practically non @-@ recur@@ ring . &quot;
&quot; upon request of the community , the organization liber@@ ates the following core material from the securing measures after this Convention : &quot;
&quot; a ) special sp@@ elling material , if it is used in grams - or smaller quantities as sensor in instruments ; &quot;
&quot; B ) core material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities by Article 13 , if the core material is returned , and &quot;
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ onium with an is@@ ot@@ onic concentration of pl@@ ut@@ onium 238 that is over 80 % .
&quot; for the search of the community , the organization liber@@ ates nuclear materials that would otherwise be liable to this agreement , if the whole , due to this article in the States delivered its kernel amount to no time more than &quot;
&quot; a ) a total of a kilogram of special p@@ alt@@ or material , consisting of one or more of the following materials : &quot;
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of his weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; III ) Ur@@ an with a enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural uran , is calculated by multip@@ lication of his weight with the fifth square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
&quot; B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural uran and de@@ pl@@ eted urine , with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ; &quot;
&quot; C ) twenty metric tons of de@@ pl@@ eted urine , with enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) , or among them ; &quot;
&quot; deliver@@ able core material is to be processed together with core material , which are subject to the securing measures after this agreement , processed or stored for the re@@ use of securing measures on that material . &quot;
&quot; the community meets with the organisation of supplem@@ entary dra@@ g@@ ations , which is necessary to determine the tasks of the organisation according to this agreement , in the individual which determine the procedure specified in the Convention . &quot;
supplem@@ entary ab@@ outs can be changed or changed without change of this agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; supplem@@ entary ab@@ uses occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this convention in force . the organization , the community and the states are all efforts to perform this convention within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of the agreement between the organisation , the community and the States . &quot;
&quot; the organization is based on the basis of the initial data directory of the entire , securing measures of this convention in the states , regardless of its origin , and leads to the following reports and results of its subsequent reports and results . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States , Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxemburg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the other hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; in the European Economic Cooperation Committee , NA@@ CH@@ STE@@ H@@ EN@@ DER Re@@ asons ( a ) The EEC has decided to help meet the special shareholders &apos; conference on the conference for international economic cooperation with low income , whose development is han@@ dicapped accessible by general resource problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the aim of the EEC and the Member States to be bound by the Member States and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do their potential to achieve this goal . &quot;
D ) The EEC and the organisation have cons@@ ul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the Middle bin@@ dings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the context of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the EEC has submitted a table , which is clearly stated in which the criteria intended to apply in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization focuses on a special account under the designation &quot; Special shareholders &apos; , which consists of the funds provided with this agreement to the special shareholders ; this account is specified by the organisation as a car@@ et@@ akers &apos; , and only to that agreement in this agreement , and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the special shareholders will be separate and separated from all other accounts and acti@@ vism of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are as follows : a ) Payment will take place in the form of cash or in@@ tox@@ in debt , which shall be paid upon request in the currency of the organization as the administrator of the organization as the administrator of the organization in the country to be deposited in the country . &quot;
&quot; B ) The payment takes place in two rates , namely i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . of the post within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or another between the EEC and the administrator agreed . &quot;
II ) the second in the amount of the amount of contributions to 1 January 1979 or at another time that agreed between the EEC and the ste@@ ward taking into consideration the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval .
C ) Every member state can afford payments to the above date .
&quot; the car@@ et@@ akers , according to the custom@@ ary procedure of the organization , takes about proportional pulling on cash or the debt to cover the issues for the special account and the special shareholders in a reasonable manner . &quot;
&quot; in the warranty of these loans , the ste@@ wards can be derived according to the conditions of the following factors : &quot;
III ) the extent that the international economic factors contributed to the current and fore@@ se@@ eable economic problems of the country ;
&quot; VI ) The composition , and the trend of the debt service in the country and its further lending capacity for loan conditions without compensation ; and &quot;
VII ) the circum@@ ference in which the problems of the relevant countries can regulate by contributions from other sources .
&quot; any special note serves to finance the financing of a clear and rapid @-@ payment program or fore@@ hab@@ it ( including a se@@ ct@@ oral role program ) , which is ir@@ respective of whether it is to be considered to be the case of the organisation , financed and practices that the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement is the aim of the addition to the Additional Agre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the special shareholders may not be used instead of murder of the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) , or the organization , which have been approved as part of a loan or association , which has been approved by the Director of the Bank or organization . &quot;
&quot; apart from Section 4 , special charges apply to the same return payment , which is generally granted for the organization of developing countries in general ; they are therefore refundable at ten years in 50 years . &quot;
&quot; custom users are granted in one or more currencies on the Member States , and are refundable in these currencies . &quot;
amounts to payment of these prayers are directly to the organization that ret@@ ains it .
&quot; every special licence is due to a separate loan agreements between the receiving country and the ste@@ ward , in which the origin of the means is given . &quot;
&quot; the income from any special interest rate can be used for issues in the currency of the receiving country or for goods or services , the members of the organization , and the members of the organization , which could be defined as the administrator at the time of loan granted , recipient of a special offer . &quot;
&quot; capital out@@ flow of special charges are made to the special shareholders , and the amount paid to this way in the currency of a Member State will return as soon as possible from the administrator to the relevant member state . &quot;
&quot; the administrator is instructed to complete the EEC concerning the audit , subject to the authorized access by the directors of the directors , and the directors approved by the directors approved by the directors . &quot;
&quot; during the time of the withdrawal of the special acceptance , the ste@@ wards has been teaching the EEC four annually on the development of the special interest rate and the expenses . &quot;
the EEC transfers the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the fiscal year of the organisation a detailed analysis of the organisation with an opinion of the organisation of the organisation on this account .
&quot; after full payment of the special interest rates , the administrator of the EEC is transmitted as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects financed by the special shareholders of finance and programs . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ akers created and performs suitable records and invo@@ ices , from which the contributions to the special shareholders , resulting from the account obligations that are issued to the account and intenti@@ onally paid to the Member States . &quot;
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ akers are working closely together with the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator to the complete edition of the funds of the special shareholders of time to time a thought exchange about the status of the special shareholder or projects , and over all other questions related to the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date that agreed to the EEC and the organization , not into force , so the agreement and all of the parties shall fall due to the immediate effect of the parties with immediate effect . &quot;
&quot; according to Article II Section 8 , this agreement is rep@@ aid and transferred to the Member States to rep@@ aid and to the Member States , this agreement and all the parties of the parties are re@@ signed with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC in accordance with the legal provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States rati@@ fy the Secret@@ ariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclusion the procedure .
the Secret@@ ariat direc@@ ts these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication of the EEC concerning the EEC to the organization .
this agreement is effective and occurs in force on the first day of the month that follows on the day of the noti@@ fications of the mentioned Noti@@ fications .
&quot; this agreement is contained in two origin@@ als in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch . &quot;
&quot; in the consideration that the agreement is issued in form a letter to change the Protocol &apos;s A of the Protocol no . 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , &quot;
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled core fusion and Plas@@ map@@ hysi@@ cs
&quot; the EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE Atom@@ ic Community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after , called &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot;
&quot; and the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called the Federal Council , &quot;
&quot; this program covers the creation of a large test system , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation of a Common company according to Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - below &quot; &quot; Common Enterprise J@@ ET &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for several years , Switzerland has been concerned with research work in the field of controlled core fusion and plasma @-@ hysi@@ cs and is highly familiar with the field of care . &quot;
&quot; because of its practical use of controlled core fusion , it is still possible to cooperate in the interests of the present agreement to avoid unnecessary over@@ l@@ apping and to accelerate their respective research , which caused a higher priority level due to the energy crisis . &quot;
&quot; this agreement should be able to move by a dis@@ closure of its research on the field of controlled core fusion , and plasma @-@ physi@@ que from the potential benefits of research , i.e. the cost @-@ competitive electricity production by using the controlled core action reaction , faster . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the target of the present agreement , the contra@@ ctual parties identified their respective in Annex I and II of this agreement , below &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Swiss Program . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to ensure a effective collaboration , the Swiss Program assumes the long @-@ term targets and the forms of cooperation of the Eur@@ atom program ; it will be extended or changed after testing in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement that this may be relevant to the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; every time , if the contract parties accept a new program , this will be taken at the site of the or of App@@ endi@@ x I and II to the present agreement . &quot;
the association of association will be realised through : - An appropriate participation in each of the contra@@ ctual parties during preparation and execution of the programs of the other party .
&quot; - exchange of personnel among the relevant laboratory laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , in Switzerland and third @-@ States , with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratories that work on the Eur@@ atom program ; &quot;
- included right to access to scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
&quot; within the context of the present agreement , Switzerland took part in the J@@ ET project . &quot;
&quot; with regard to implementation of articles 2 Section 1 of this agreement , the association agreement concluded an association agreement , subsequent &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible , the association between the Commission and the States and companies or persons , herein@@ after referred to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is taking care of taking part in the agreement of the present agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the Associate Organ@@ s , &quot; standing &quot; agreement on personnel exchange . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland , with the time of the present agreement of the present agreement , belongs to J@@ ET , whose stat@@ ute is accepted . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Eur@@ atom is to concern that the Swiss contra@@ ctual partner can be concluded in the context of the present agreement , except for association contracts or other similar contracts that will be closed from Eur@@ atom during the validity of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the organs , related to the implementation of the association specified in Article 2 Section 1 of the present agreement , are described in Article 5 to 10 of this agreement and the Association Agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the association agreement applies especially to the en@@ forcement of a steering committee , the representative of the Commission and the Federal Council . &quot;
&quot; - to monitor the development of research work , allowing for the best possible results in line with the objectives of this agreement . &quot;
Switzerland is represented by the most two delegates in the framework of the Eur@@ atom program - in the following &quot; VG &quot; - represented in the following &quot; VG . &quot;
&quot; the VG , which has the exchange of information exchange and cooperation in all questions concerning the current or planned programmes and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom program , deals with regard to all research and development activities related to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and aimed at the interests of both parties in the Eur@@ atom program and in the Swiss programme , as well as in Article 1 of the present agreement , the common scientific and technological developments will be considered in the world . &quot;
&quot; according to its Rules of Rules , VG will host one or more Swiss representatives in the framework of the Eur@@ atom program , whenever the responsible Swiss authorities are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the consultants , which provides the VG research proposal with regard to the best possible scientific results , take this task with regard to all research and development work , as regards the agreement with regard to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of the Eur@@ atom program , Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the involved laboratories in the framework of the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; the director of directors that have the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and responsible for this is that the capacity of the laboratories which are involved in the framework of the program are optim@@ ally used , fu@@ tile this task in terms of research and development which fall under the present agreement . &quot;
he especially cares for the best use of the staff and for the exchange of the same between the laboratories which are involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and the Swiss programme .

&quot; in the accession of new Member States , the community will change in consultation with New Zealand , in clause 2 , according to the volume of New Zealand trade , with each new member state . &quot;
import charges for these new Member States will be established in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; here is the case mentioned in clause 5 of the exhau@@ st@@ ion calculation .
&quot; in clause 2 , the total amount of Greece is fixed to the community &apos;s accession to the community with a total weight of 245 tons . &quot;
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid a market development , which could affect the normal paragraph of New Zealand and L@@ amm@@ atic on the common market within the agreed amounts . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the community applies to the inter@@ vention@@ ist conditions of frozen meat in frozen flesh due to the implementation of this objective . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the two contra@@ ctual parties under@@ take everything to promote the consumption of Schaff@@ hausen in the community without threat to market stability . &quot;
&quot; taking into account of the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community is to agree that any actual application of funds or other promotion measures are carried out in line with the existing international obligations and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and to comply with the traditional share of the commun@@ ion with these products . &quot;
&quot; in New Zealand , the compliance with the 2 @-@ mentioned amounts in clause 2 guarantees that there is no compensation for the quantities of this amounts . &quot;
&quot; the community is oblig@@ ated to meet all necessary precau@@ tions for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned products , so that the issu@@ ance of inclusion in New Zealand is dependent on the presentation of an exclusion license which is named by the New Zealand Government . &quot;
&quot; the details for the application of this system are defined , so that on the position of a deposit for the distribution of import license conditions can be ren@@ ounces . &quot;
&quot; in implementing regulations , it is defined that the competent authority of the community has been issued in regular intervals that have been granted the quantities ; these figures are to be de@@ cryp@@ ted for determining country . &quot;
&quot; the exclusion helps to worry , that the agreement is applied properly , and are smooth . &quot;
&quot; the expansion regularly checks the tendency to the H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb , and goats meat market of the two contra@@ ctual parties and on the global market as well as the conditions on these markets , including the conditions set for which in clause 7 is the target of importance . &quot;
&quot; it does not worry , that the application of the agreement is not affected by the agreement that products from H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb , and goats are not mentioned under the agreement under the agreement . &quot;
&quot; at the implementation of the agreement , all questions posed by a contra@@ ctual party and recommends appropriate solutions to the relevant authorities . &quot;
the provisions of this agreement applies to the rights and obligations of the parties within the G@@ AT@@ T framework .
&quot; clause 2 stipul@@ ated in clause 2 for the period from 1 January to 31 December . in the amount of entry into force , this agreement will be set up to 1 January . &quot;
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas where the contract is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and on the other hand on the other hand and for the New Zealand region . &quot;
&quot; this agreement will occur on 20 October 1980 in force . it is valid until 31 March 1984 . after this time , it remains in force , subject to any contra@@ ctual party to termin@@ ate it with a period of one year prior to 1 April 1984 . in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed with a period of 1 April 1984 . &quot;
I ad@@ ore myself to propose if your government can agree that this writing and your ant@@ word write together an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand in this area .
&quot; I congrat@@ ulate on the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to the establishment of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goats from New Zealand to the community in connection with the use of the regulation on a common market organisation for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb , and goats . &quot;
the above @-@ standing amounts are implemented in the conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
&quot; the community as@@ sures that New Zealand shall not be hin@@ dered with this agreement , to use new technological developments , or maintain its competitive position on the community of community . &quot;
&quot; should a change of the offer form , as a result of changes in technology and trade , should be cons@@ ul@@ ted to the two contra@@ ctual parties in the case of such a change in clause 10 , in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; taking into account of the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community is to agree that any actual application of funds or other promotion measures are carried out in line with the existing international obligations and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and to comply with the traditional share of the commun@@ ion with these products . &quot;

I ad@@ mi@@ red me if your government can agree that this writing and your ant@@ word write together an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand in this area .
&quot; I hon@@ oring to inform you that my government can agree to the pre@@ ference , and that your letter and the reply write together an agreement according to your proposal . &quot;
&quot; in the form of a stamp , between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Ö@@ st@@ lich of Uruguay on the trade with H@@ amm@@ el and L@@ amm@@ al &quot;
&quot; I consider myself to set up the shortest negotiations between our deleg@@ ations on the import of H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb , and goats meat from Uruguay in the European Economic Community in connection with the use of the common market organisation for sheep and goats . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are as follows : &quot;
&quot; - fresh or cooled H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and kid ( Tari@@ f@@ stelle 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) of the Common Cust@@ oms Tari@@ ff ) ; &quot;

&quot; within the context of this agreement , the training possibilities for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb , and goats from Uruguay are set up in the following annual amount : &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure a imp@@ ec@@ cable function of the agreement , Uruguay is obliged to ensure that the amount of stock does not exceed the agreed amount , and implemented in accordance with conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change of the offer form , as a result of changes in technology and trade , should be cons@@ ul@@ ted to the two parties of this agreement with one of such a change in the under number 10 , in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community is entitled to take care of the protective cover , they are obliged to worry about that , in this agreement , access to the common market has not been touched . &quot;
&quot; in the case that the imports from Uruguay exceed the agreed amounts in Uruguay , the community reserves the right to implement the imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year . &quot;
the community is committed to restri@@ ct the exhau@@ st@@ ion to the imports of products shown by this agreement on a court rate of 10 BC . AD val@@ o@@ rem .
&quot; when accession of new Member States changes the community in consultation with Uruguay that , under number 2 fixed amount , according to the scope of the Urugu@@ ay@@ an trade , with every new member state . &quot;
import charges for these new Member States will be established in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; it is applied to the assignment of the added value added under number 5 .
&quot; under number 2 , the total amount of Greece is fixed to the community &apos;s accession to the community at 5 800 tons of slaughter . &quot;
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid a market development , which could affect the marketing Urugu@@ ay@@ an H@@ amm@@ el and L@@ amm@@ atic on the common market within the agreed amounts . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the fellowship of inter@@ vention@@ ist batt@@ lements meets the provision of frozen meat in frozen meat according to the implementation of the regulation of Urugu@@ ay@@ an Schaff@@ hausen . &quot;

&quot; the blood flow takes place as@@ ep@@ tic ; blood is guided by a closed , ster@@ iles system into a ster@@ ile bottle , in which the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans@@ k was filed in front of the ster@@ il@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; after completion of the blood@@ stream , the bottle is immediately ref@@ illed to cool down to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . afterwards , it must be opened immediately before the use of the blood . &quot;
&quot; in volume , the anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans@@ solution can no longer be less than 220 ml per liter of human blood , and the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster concentration may not exceed 97 g per liter . &quot;
the blood group according to the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system is previously used to determine the blood cells and the ser@@ ums ; determination of the R@@ h factor takes place through the investigation of blood cells in a new sample of don@@ or blood .

&quot; the human full blood is protected in ster@@ ile , closed bottle before micro@@ organisms and keep up to its use at a temperature of 4 to 6 C ; higher temperatures are permitted only while the blood is allowed to cool back to 4 to 6 C . &quot;
a concentr@@ ating of human red blood cells is a unit of human blood blo@@ ws from which the largest part of the plasma has been removed .
it contains all red blood cells of the unit which has been won ; other blood vessels can be present or can be partially removed .
&quot; the liquid content of the concentration consists of either the remaining plasma or a suitable arti@@ f@@ ical solution , which was added after plasma . &quot;
&quot; the volume of red blood cells should be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product , however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , so the approximate percentage of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes volume ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit ) is to be issued on the label . &quot;
&quot; all processes required for manufacturing processes must be made under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the exhaust must be made under use of ster@@ ile , closed system , and only by pressure . &quot;

the human dry plasma is extracted through de@@ hydr@@ ation of the liquid that is app@@ alled at cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ging or se@@ di@@ mentation of human perfection above .
&quot; the human dry plasma is extracted through the cooling drying or any other method , which is avoided by a den@@ atured of proteins . &quot;
&quot; the dry product is easily dissolved in a water quantity , which is equivalent to the liquid level , from which one went out in the production of the substance . &quot;
&quot; the protein concentration of the so @-@ won solution can not be less than 45 g per litre , and the solution must be no visible sign of ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis products . &quot;

&quot; if the plasma is not mixed and frozen within 48 hours after the blood flow , the ster@@ ility of each unit must be detected in a blood quantity of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; in order to turn off the harmful effects of bacterial growth products in plasma , blood don@@ ates , the sign of a bacteria in@@ fest@@ ation must not be used ; the ster@@ ility of each donation must be proven in a blood quantity of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the danger of the transfer of I@@ no@@ kul@@ eles she@@ ep@@ itis , they are not able to use more than 12 donations , which do not apply more than 12 donations , which are known to come down this danger in a similar way . &quot;
&quot; one of the liquid tight , by which one went out in the manufacture of plasma , corresponding water amount is added ; the substance must be completely dissolved within 10 minutes at 15 to 20 C . &quot;
&quot; an added quant@@ um plasma is dissolved in the water quantity , which was produced by liquid tight ; the solution will be subjected to the following tests : &quot;
&quot; II ) If one uses 1 ml of a sufficient amount of Th@@ rom@@ bin or calcium chloride , it takes place ; the process can be accelerated in the brood @-@ oven at 37 C . &quot;

&quot; human alb@@ um@@ in and fra@@ ctions from human plasma proteins are samples from the protein component , which consist of about 60 % of the total protein mass of the plasma . &quot;
&quot; without regard , whether the final product should be flu@@ ffy or dry , the preparation according to an appropriate stabili@@ zer must be heated to 60 C ± 0.5 C in the final container in the final container for 10 hours in the final container . &quot;
&quot; in preparation of human alb@@ um@@ in , at least 95 % of the mass of the existing proteins must be alb@@ um@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in both preparations , no more than 10 mg of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ulin can be present per gram of the product . &quot;
&quot; if the end product is dried up , it must contain at least 950 mg of protein per gram of the product . &quot;
&quot; as a solution , the Group is made of human plasma rot@@ ein as a solution , so it must be a total protein concentration between 45 and 50 g per litre . &quot;
&quot; as a solution , human alb@@ um@@ in is produced as a solution , it must be a total protein concentration of at least 45 g per liter . &quot;
&quot; compar@@ ing measurements of viscosity and exercising and cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ging with the Ul@@ tra@@ cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and elec@@ trop@@ ho@@ re@@ se , which are carried out before and after heating to the solutions , no signs of a den@@ atured of the dissolved proteins are allowed . &quot;
