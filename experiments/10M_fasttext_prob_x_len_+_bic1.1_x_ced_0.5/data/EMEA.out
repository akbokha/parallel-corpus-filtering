this document is a summary of the European Public Research Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which explains how the Committee for Human@@ itarian Ar@@ ist ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the studies carried out in order to comply with recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or her treatment , please read the packing tape ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or apply to your doctor or pharmac@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; if you want more information regarding the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg of hot tablets ( tablets which dissolve in the mouth ) as a solution for setting ( 1 mg / ml ) and a injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. , thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or vision of things that are not present ) , Mis@@ str@@ ust and W@@ ahn@@ tions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a psych@@ ic illness in which patients have altern@@ ate normal episodes ( periods of abnormal mood ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood . &quot;
&quot; Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat severe severe episodes and prevention of various episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past . &quot;
injection solution is applied to rapid control of increased ag@@ itation or behavi@@ oral disorders if the oral medication is not possible .
&quot; for both diseases , the solution can be used or the melting tablets in patients can be applied to which the swal@@ lowing of tablets need difficulties . &quot;
&quot; patients who use other medicines at the same time as Abi@@ li@@ fy , should be adjusted the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between cereb@@ ral cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l probably affects especially as &quot; partial ag@@ ro &quot; for the recept@@ ors for neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ ot@@ onin ) .
&quot; this means Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but in much larger than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin can play a role in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , which prevents psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms , and its reaction is prevented . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy , preventing symptoms occur in three trials over a year . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of injection solution was compared to two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia , or similar diseases resulting in irrit@@ ated ag@@ itation , over a period of two hours with a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy became more than twelve weeks of 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo that have been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy in which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was observed in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( a different anti@@ psych@@ otic medicine ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , the change of symptoms of patients with a standard scope of bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who were examined on treatment . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company also led studies by to investigate how the body re@@ absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution into import . &quot;
&quot; in both studies using the injection solution showed patients , the Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction of symptoms that received placebo . &quot;
&quot; in application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ time studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo did not treat the resur@@ gence of various episodes in previously treated patients and when it was given to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy @-@ injec@@ tions in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses have also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ less@@ ness and were similar effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common adverse events of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) , headache , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , headache , Nau@@ sea ( fatigue ) , fatigue , Nau@@ sea ( fatigue ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion , so@@ othing ( sleep problems ) , fatigue ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
the Commission for Human@@ itarian Aid ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and from medium @-@ severe some serious episodes for patients who were mostly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes of the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l spoke to the risks .
&quot; in addition , the Committee came to the result that the advantages of injection solution in the rapid control of increased ag@@ itation and behavi@@ our@@ al problems with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or patients with man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if a oral therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . a approval for the placing of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union . &quot;
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is used for the treatment of moderate to severe some episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily from meals .
&quot; a increased efficacy of doses over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 m@@ g. a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y &apos;s efficacy in treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not detected .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered as clinical factors ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
the occurr@@ ence of su@@ icides are among psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective distur@@ ban@@ ces and was reported in some cases after the onset of anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of a epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no increased su@@ icides cancer in patients with bi@@ polar disorder compared to other anti @-@ psychological disorder .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be treated with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( M@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ gest@@ ion , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , conditions that are prescribed for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; if with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y patients treated signs and symptoms of an late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ ism , should be taken into consideration , reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ ns , or a clear fever without an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics have to be removed , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l should be used in patients with cr@@ iti@@ zation in the an@@ am@@ nese or in conditions that are associated with cor@@ rid@@ ors in connection with caution . &quot;
56 - 99 years old with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l associated with psych@@ osis who were associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l to placebo in comparison to placebo .
&quot; however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fic@@ tional dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to un@@ wanted dis@@ ru@@ ined events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ azi@@ de or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; there are no precise risk inv@@ alu@@ able for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia related events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic diseases , which allow direct compar@@ is@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes mell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is generally used in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ie due to Com@@ or@@ bi@@ d@@ ities , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics which is known for weight gain as side effects , and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ x@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advis@@ able when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with excessive side effects such as seals ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H2 @-@ ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ x@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study of healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to expect that other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects should be undertaken . &quot;
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites can result in higher plasma concentrations of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations in comparison to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 extensively .
&quot; if you consider the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the potential benefits should be the potential risks to the patient . &quot;
&quot; other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ eas@@ ors , should have similar effects , and therefore similar dos@@ reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after replacing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the dose height before the accompanying therapy . &quot;
&quot; dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ u@@ op@@ ram , or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are given together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be calculated with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations . &quot;
clinical trials showed doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l per day no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ method@@ ology morph@@ ine ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; due to insufficient data situation on the safety of human beings and due to the reaction studies in the animal &apos;s concerns , this drug may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the possible benefit justi@@ fies potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , the patients should be warned against such dangerous machinery , including power vehicles , to use until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l has no negative impact on them . &quot;
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; sch@@ izophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , patients with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l were treated with a total of lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , ac@@ yst@@ ony and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo . &quot;
in another controlled study of more than 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in therapy .
&quot; man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % was among patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment . &quot;
in another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term development phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % treated patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters showed no medical meaning@@ less differences .
&quot; enh@@ ancing the CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; adverse events that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and above their appearance with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ ic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and increased mortality in older dem@@ entia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes mell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intenti@@ onal or un@@ intenti@@ onal over@@ do@@ si@@ ders were observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without any death sequence . &quot;
&quot; although there are no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ aly@@ sis in treating an overdose with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l , however , it is unlikely that hem@@ aly@@ sis in treatment of a surplus value is , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma connection . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is de@@ pressed in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1 receptor and ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity to D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 receptor and for ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors as well as a moderate aff@@ inity for D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4- to ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ ches and to the hist@@ amine receptor . &quot;
&quot; in the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l in doses of 0.5 to 30 m@@ g. a day over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers showed a dos@@ ing reduction of dos@@ ing of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , on Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on Putin &apos;s name . &quot;
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1.@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significantly stronger improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms .
&quot; in week 52 , the proportion of the patients who cons@@ ented to teach in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol is 73 % ) in both groups . &quot;
&quot; current values from Mess@@ sk@@ als defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - Depression Scale , showed significantly stronger improvements than for Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in decline , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % below placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study enrolled in sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients had a weight gain of minimum 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg in average weight ) . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a placebo over 3 weeks compared to placebo .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fi@@ xer dos@@ ing patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy against placebo . &quot;
&quot; in two Plac@@ ement@@ - and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic tra@@ its , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a positive effect compared to placebo with lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l also showed a similar share in patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ie to like lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which were partially more than 2 weeks not on Li@@ thi@@ um@@ - or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic symptoms resulting in reducing carbon symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed up placebo during a stabil@@ ising phase of placebo during the prevention of a bi@@ polar refund , predominantly in the prevention of a bi@@ polar refund . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzymes responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ ap@@ ulation is used by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al@@ time is about 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in an extensive met@@ abol@@ ism about CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and for nearly 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ising about CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l , there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , and also showed no gender @-@ dependent effects in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic patients . &quot;
a pop @-@ specific evaluation for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics revealed no indication on clin@@ ically significant differences regarding ethnic origin or the effect of the space on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe genetic in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study involving subjects with a different cir@@ rh@@ osis of liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impair@@ ment of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the class C , which is not sufficient to pull battles on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies for safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated gifts , reproduction x@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and the can@@ o@@ gens potential , the pre @-@ clinical data have no particular dangers for the human being . &quot;
&quot; tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed , only at dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , that they only have limited or meaning for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; the effects resulting in dos@@ ages of secondary epi@@ der@@ mal pig@@ ment ( AU@@ C ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 @-@ 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 times the average Ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the average maximum dose for humans ) at 60 mg / kg / day ( the average maximum dose for humans ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a Chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was considered as a result of the precipitation of sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ ju@@ g@@ ate from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral treatment of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2 ) at the recommended dose dose . &quot;
&quot; however , in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg , the concentrations of sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were not detected more than 6 % of the concentrations that were observed in the study over 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys ( 6 % ) in vitro @-@ sol@@ ubil@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ fold in the middle Ste@@ ady state AU@@ C in the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ u@@ op@@ ram , or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are given together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be calculated with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % was among patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - &quot;

&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study enrolled in sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients had a weight gain of minimum 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg in average weight ) . &quot;
&quot; 97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fi@@ xer dos@@ ing patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy against placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l was compared to the use with 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in tablets , the ratio was between the geomet@@ ric C@@ maximum value of the solution and the value of tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) . &quot;

&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ fold in the middle Ste@@ ady state AU@@ C in the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is used for rapid control of ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or patients with man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar I disorder when an oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; once so@@ unding clin@@ ically appropriate , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be terminated and with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; to minim@@ ize the Res@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ ize the vari@@ ability , an injection is recommended in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus @-@ maxim@@ us muscle to prevent adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot;
&quot; a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) can be adjusted dependent on individual clinical status , taking into account for maintenance or acute therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a secondary treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l is indicated , see summary of the characteristics of the medicine using AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y pills , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y melting tablet or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution . &quot;
there are no investigation on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ our@@ al problems which caused different as through sch@@ izophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar I disorder .
&quot; if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ edi@@ az@@ ep@@ ins in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l injection solution is considered necessary , patients should be observed with regard to extreme poverty or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
research on safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution is not prescribed for patients with alcohol or drug tox@@ icity ( by using or illegal medicines ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be treated with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( M@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ gest@@ ion , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , conditions that are prescribed for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle sti@@ f@@ ness , changing consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , speed@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mia ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes mell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is generally used in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ie due to Com@@ or@@ bi@@ d@@ ities , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain as side effects , and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ an was greater compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , in a study where the healthy subjects Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) was applied as one @-@ time input in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ ine ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; 105 The H2 @-@ Ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically . &quot;

&quot; other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and H@@ IV@@ - prot@@ eas@@ ors , should have similar effects , and therefore similar dos@@ reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after replacing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the dose height before the accompanying therapy . &quot;
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ ine received the intensity of Sed@@ ation larger than that of Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l .
the following side effects were more common in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :

&quot; 107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified in clinical trials involving oral arith@@ me@@ zo@@ l as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) : &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was among patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo . &quot;
in another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
&quot; in the long @-@ term development phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was treated for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % treated with placebo . &quot;
a comparison between the patient groups using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters showed no medical meaning@@ less differences .
&quot; enh@@ ancing the CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;

110 and behavi@@ our@@ al problems was the Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l injection solution with statistically significant improvement of ag@@ iti@@ vity / de@@ duction disorders compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ oral problems associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms regarding ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ our@@ al problems in comparison to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed average improvement in the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS excitement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour final point was 5.8 for placebo , 9.6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ iti@@ vity , a similar efficacy in relation to the total population was observed , but a statistical significance could be determined because of a reduced patient count . &quot;
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) compared to placebo a statistically significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms .
&quot; in week 52 , the proportion of the patients who cons@@ ented to teach in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 73 % ) in both groups . &quot;
&quot; current values from Mess@@ sk@@ als defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ Depres@@ sions scale , showed significantly stronger improvements than for Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo controlled study over 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia ( oral ) , a significantly higher reduction in the decline , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study involved in sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included in the primary study &apos; weight gain &apos; , an increase of at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg in average weight ) . &quot;
111 In a placebo controlled study over 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder with or without psych@@ otic characteristics which were partly over 2 weeks not on Li@@ thi@@ um@@ - or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic symptoms when compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week course , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l had reached placebo during a stabil@@ ising phase of placebo during the prevention of a bi@@ polar refund , predominantly in the prevention of a bi@@ polar refund . &quot;
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection 90 % bigger the AU@@ C according to the same dose as tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the average time to reach the maximum plasma level is 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was well toler@@ ated by rats and apes and resulted in no direct tox@@ icity of a target organ after repeated treatment in a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) that were built in 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular installations .
&quot; in studies for the reproduction x@@ icity in intraven@@ ous application , there is no security concerns according to maternal exposure that lay 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , Tox@@ icity at repeated gift , reproduction x@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and the can@@ o@@ gens potential , the pre @-@ clinical data have no particular dangers for the human being . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study , enrolled at the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters had previously obtained anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients on the treatment , compared with 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who were diagnosed with conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; considering the patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between drugs and survival for the first time for metastatic breast cancer . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to people who had previously obtained other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , in terms of these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane containing more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained drugs . &quot;
&quot; it must also be applied in patients , the breast@@ feeding or before the treatment of low neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ es in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the Human@@ ist &apos;s Committee ( CH@@ MP ) states that Abra@@ x@@ ane drugs contained in patients where the first treatment does not strike more effectively , more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained drugs and not to reduce side effects in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs . &quot;
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission granted Bios@@ ci@@ ence Limited , a approval for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane , in the whole European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is missing and is not indicated for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in patients with severe neutr@@ rop@@ enia ( neutral capacity &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory neu@@ rop@@ athy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in Sens@@ ory Neu@@ rop@@ athy degrees 3 the treatment is to interru@@ pt , until a improvement of degrees 1 or 2 is reached , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adap@@ t@@ ations in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies involving patients with associated kidney function and there is currently no sufficient data about the recommendation of dose adap@@ t@@ ations in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for the application in children under 18 years due to insufficient data for un@@ question@@ able and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ o@@ idal form@@ ulating from Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el which could have much pharmac@@ ological features as other formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the drug should be immediately abolished and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment is treated , and the patient should not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in patients , no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated , up to the neutr@@ ality count again increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l , and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ c@@ count increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while a clear with Abra@@ x@@ ane was not detected in connection of cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , cardiovascular disease is not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or ag@@ grav@@ ating heart disease or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vomiting and diarr@@ hea , these are treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ent means . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied in pregnant women , or in women with ten@@ derly age , which does not practice effective conception , except for the treatment of mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is inev@@ itable . &quot;
women in ten@@ dering age should apply during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable prevention method .
&quot; male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , is recommended , during and up to six months after treatment no child . &quot;
male patients should be advised before treatment on a sperm cells because the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and dizziness ( common ) that can effect on the traffic noise and the ability to serve machines .
&quot; following are the most common and most important events of adverse events listed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al Phase III trial once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; neut@@ rop@@ enia was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( 79 % of patients ) , and was quickly reversible and dos@@ cope ; Leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of patients . &quot;
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane patients and was severe in three cases severe ( h@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
&quot; in table 1 , adverse events are listed in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in any dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;

pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli ingredient that promotes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli through inhibit@@ or of their dep@@ oly@@ mers .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to a normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vit@@ ational inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in is convey@@ s the Trans@@ zy@@ t@@ osis of Plas@@ ma@@ ids in the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies has been demonstrated that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was supported by end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved trans@@ end@@ othel@@ ial transport is medi@@ ated through the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ ous receptor and caused a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in c@@ yst@@ eine in the field of tum@@ ors .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two single @-@ blind studies and of 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ized Phase III compar@@ ative study .
&quot; in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion about 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer . &quot;
&quot; this multic@@ enter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as well as 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medi@@ ation of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 ( N = 229 ) . &quot;
&quot; during the recording in the study , 64 % of patients had a state of general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al met@@ ast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had not yet received chemotherapy , 27 % had only a adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % because of metast@@ ases and 19 % for met@@ ast@@ er@@ sing and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; 9 Results for the general response rate and time to progression free survival and progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; first @-@ line therapy , are listed below . &quot;
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving a degree of patients who lived at a time during therapy a peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy degrees 3 .
the natural course of peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy to sound on Bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of the total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies .
&quot; the carbon exposure ( AU@@ C ) rose early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml with a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; 10 After an intraven@@ ous gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane , patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 took the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration on multi@@ phase . &quot;
the medium distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 . the high distribution volume indicates an extensive extra@@ vas@@ cular distribution and / or turn@@ outs of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
&quot; in a study involving patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ genetic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 , with the values following a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane gift ( 43 % ) than after a solv@@ ent pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection and also the distribution volume was at Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
&quot; in the published literature about in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue stories , pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is in first line to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) . &quot;
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative response was 4 % of the total dose for cum@@ ulative dose of 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el which points to an extensive not @-@ ren@@ al cle@@ aring . &quot;
&quot; about patients at the age of over 75 years , however , only few data are available , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
&quot; the chemical and physical stability was proven at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box , and protected against light light over 8 hours . &quot;

&quot; the member states must ensure that , in front of the market , the owner of approval was provided by medical specialists in di@@ aly@@ sis centers and retail stores with the following information and materials : &quot;
• training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medicine ( technical information ) , labelling and packing list . • With unique appearance of the product desired cooling boxes for transport through the patient . &quot;
&quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed a biological medicine is similar , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and also contains the same substance ( also called &quot; reference dent@@ ist &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients with normal blood pressure values , in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur if the procedure is not possible before the procedure and where a blood loss of 900 up to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot;
treatment with se@@ eg@@ ulation must be initiated under the supervision of a physician to have the experience in the treatment of patients with diseases which is indicated for the medicine .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own bleeding , Ab@@ se@@ amed is in@@ jected into a v@@ ein . &quot;
injection can also be carried out by the patient or its car@@ et@@ sper@@ son as far as they have received an appropriate guidance .
patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and patients who receive chemotherapy should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ ant in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
&quot; the iron values of all patients are to control before treatment , to ensure that no iron deficiency might be given , and iron energy should be given during the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who receive chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by a ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency or thereby that the body is not sufficient for the body &apos;s own ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ i@@ et@@ in . &quot;
ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ i@@ et@@ in is also used before operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
&quot; it is produced by a cell that was inserted into a gene ( DNA ) , which it contributes to the formation of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ in al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with an injection in a V@@ ene in the frame of a major study with 4@@ 79 patients , which caused by kidney problems caused an@@ a@@ emia , with the reference drug . &quot;
all patients participating in this study was in@@ jected at least eight weeks in E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o into a v@@ ein before they were either put on se@@ amed or continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the efficacy was the change of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ing values between the beginning of the trial and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; in addition , the company also submitted the results of a study in which the effects of the skin spec@@ kled Ab@@ se@@ amed were investigated by the effects of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving patients that caused by kidney problems caused an@@ emia , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ing values of patients were raised in se@@ amed measurements , as for those patients who continue to study E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , the patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of se@@ se@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure that may occasionally lead to symptoms of an en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) like sudden , mig@@ rat@@ ory headache and confusion . &quot;
se@@ se@@ wer should not be applied in patients who may be sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ ox@@ et@@ in al@@ fa or other components .
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed as injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , since further studies are required to ensure that these are caused by no allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; at the end , the Committee for Human@@ itarian Aid ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the medicine has been implemented according to the regulations of the European Union of evidence that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile like E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company which approaches Ab@@ se@@ amed is to provide information about the security of the medicine in all Member States , including information on the safety of the pharmaceutical industry . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission granted Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG , a approval for the distribution of se@@ wage in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; treatment of an@@ emia and reduction of transaction requirements in adults with solid tum@@ ors , mal@@ ign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multip@@ lier M@@ yel@@ oma , who receive chemotherapy alone and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion ( for example cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) . &quot;
treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,2 @-@ 8.1 m@@ mol / l &#93; ( no iron deficiency ) if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or in@@ adequate , for the larger operational interventions that require a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood on women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; for a reduction of foreign bl@@ ut , Ab@@ se@@ wer can be applied to an adult orthop@@ edi@@ c surgery in adults without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of transaction compensation is expected . &quot;
HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml can be applied to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous bleeding program .
&quot; the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,2 - 7,5 m@@ mol / l ) , except for p@@ eg@@ at@@ ric patients where the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mol / l ) should be found . &quot;
&quot; symptoms and fol@@ lic@@ ts may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical trial and disease resistance is required by the doctor . &quot;
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in for over 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mol / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , occasionally , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ing values can occasionally occur above or below the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ - target concentration . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a dose management should be tried to reach the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is more than 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mol / l ) per month , or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
&quot; patients should be closely monitored in order to ensure that ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa was in the lowest approved dose , which is necessary for control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ es@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms . &quot;
&quot; the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mol / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which the initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
&quot; the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which the initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6,8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;

&quot; symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore the assessment of individual clinical trial and disease resistance is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a dose management should be tried to reach the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be closely monitored in order to ensure that ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa was in the lowest approved dose , which is necessary for checking the symptoms . &quot;
&quot; if after 4 weeks of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of at least 1 g / dl ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ se increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl to the output value , the dose should be maintained from 150 to / kg three times a week or 450 l / kg once a week . &quot;

&quot; however , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ se increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value , a response to the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be broken off . &quot;
&quot; patients with slight an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the pre @-@ sor@@ ption of ≥ 4 blood is required , should be used twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgery . &quot;

&quot; 6 The recommended dosage amounts to 600 l / kg of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ in al@@ fa , which should be given a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgery and the day of the intervention ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; at this point , Epo@@ et@@ al@@ fa was supposed to be 300 / kg each consecutive days , on the day of the intervention and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis can be given via the hose of a F@@ ist@@ el@@ na@@ del , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic cooking solution to rinse the hose and ensure a sufficient injection of the drug in the cycle . &quot;
&quot; patients who are suffering under the treatment with any ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in in a ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ ra ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive any se@@ amed or another ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in ( see section 4.4 - Ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ ra ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stroke within a month prior to treatment , inst@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ro@@ intestinal ( e.g. an@@ am@@ ne@@ stly known ven@@ ous Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ ils ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are fore@@ seen for an inhibit@@ or orthop@@ edi@@ c procedure , the application of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa can be contra@@ sted : severe cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , peri@@ ph@@ ere arter@@ ial disease , peri@@ ph@@ ere arter@@ ial disease , peri@@ ph@@ ere arter@@ ial disease ; in patients with recently restored heart attack or cereb@@ ral isch@@ emia . &quot;

&quot; in patients with sudden loss of effect , it is defined as reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased requirements for failure ( iron , folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) . &quot;
&quot; if the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ tion , considering the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ ocy@@ tes or &lt; 0,5 % ) , the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes should be normal , and if no other foundation of a loss of loss should be weighed , and if no other foundation of the bone mar@@ row should be weighed for the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA . &quot;

8 For patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency should not exceed the limitation of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration under Section 4.2 .
&quot; in clinical trials , a increased mortality rate and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ ese stimul@@ ating agents ( ESA ) were given a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
controlled clinical trials have no significant benefit that is due to the gift of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ess if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster concentration on the control of anom@@ ali@@ es symptoms and avo@@ idance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions are increased .
&quot; the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mol / l ) per month to minim@@ ize the risk of high blood pressure . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically diagnosed with cancer @-@ suffici@@ ency or storage in@@ suffici@@ ency , the limitation of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentrations should not be exceeded . &quot;
&quot; according to these findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with Epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency which are not di@@ aly@@ sis , the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency will not be accelerated . &quot;
&quot; in case of cancer patients , chemotherapy should be considered for the evaluation of the therapeutic efficiency of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in response ( patients who may have to be trans@@ fun@@ ded ) . &quot;
&quot; if the H@@ b increase is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mol / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 , to keep the risk of possible thro@@ mb@@ otic events ( see Section 4.2 of patients with chem@@ otherap@@ eutic drug value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
the decision for the use of ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine use should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction in particular patients who should consider the specific clinical context .
&quot; patients who are fore@@ seen for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ ae@@ dic procedure should be examined , if possible , before the beginning of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who under@@ go to an increased orthop@@ ae@@ dic procedure should have an appropriate risk of thro@@ mb@@ al proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cular diseases , especially in case of underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that treatment with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa was an elevated risk of postoperative thro@@ mb@@ al / vas@@ cular events . &quot;

&quot; therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed through injection into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ous ) must be given if you are treated because of a an@@ emia due to kidney disease . &quot;
a high hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .

&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney disease and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease or reservoir by in@@ adequate heart performance , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster mirror will not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , due to the treatment of blood arm@@ aments with abor@@ ation in adults with chronic kidney problems ( kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency ) that are not di@@ aly@@ sis , the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency will not be accelerated . &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa gift and the desired effect should be taken into consideration for evaluation of the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of red blood @-@ color ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and custom@@ ize your de@@ fl@@ amed dose to keep the risk of blood pressure ( thro@@ mb@@ otic event ) .
&quot; this risk should be made very carefully compared to the treatment with Epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ al vas@@ cular events , or if in the past already thro@@ mb@@ otic vas@@ cular events occurred ( e.g. deep ven@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis or pneum@@ em@@ bo@@ lie ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are cancer patients , think that Ab@@ se@@ amed means a growth factor for blood cells and can affect the tumor under certain circumstances . &quot;
&quot; when a larger orthop@@ ae@@ dic surgery is im@@ min@@ ent , before the start of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; if your values of red blood @-@ color ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed , as an increased risk of blood pressure tests after surgery . &quot;

&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is applied to the treatment of the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones spr@@ inkl@@ ed ) both in women after men@@ opause , as well as in men . &quot;
&quot; it is applied in patients with a high fra@@ cture risk ( bone bur@@ sts ) , including in patients who have recently suffered a s@@ trau@@ matic hip s@@ quar@@ ry ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changed the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip fra@@ cture should be given a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or by injection in a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce the symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease . &quot;
because the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used for the review by A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8 000 older women involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of verteb@@ rates and hip fra@@ c@@ tures were examined over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second trial included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently had suffered a hip fra@@ cture ; the number of fra@@ c@@ tures were examined over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ onate ) for six months . &quot;
the main indi@@ ct@@ ator for the efficacy was to determine whether the salary of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the serum ( an enzyme containing bone substance ) in the blood was norm@@ alised or at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ rates in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) was reduced by 70 % compared to patients . &quot;
&quot; in comparison of all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) , the risk of hip fra@@ c@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study involving men and women with hip fra@@ cture 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a fra@@ cture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 from 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most adverse events of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequently in in@@ fu@@ sions less frequently .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be used in patients who may be sensitive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ ate or any other components .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ ates , patients at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a are liable to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( extinction of bone tissue ) in the ja@@ ws . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a &apos;s manufacturer is ready to prescri@@ ptions the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , the indications how to use the medicine , as well as the material used for patients in which the side effects of the medication should be explained , and when they should apply to the doctor . &quot;

&quot; for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis for men , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended once a year . &quot;
&quot; in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic hips , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the operating supply of the fra@@ cture . ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
&quot; after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a has been observed for a long time period of patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient amount of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient amount of calcium , to ensure at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently de@@ ceased low @-@ trau@@ matic hips , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 , i.e. or@@ alem or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ ine vitamin D is recommended prior to the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced by the gift of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; patients with ren@@ al function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended as limited clinical experiences for these patients . &quot;
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability is similar to younger patients as at younger .
children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 which are missing data to un@@ question@@ able and effectiveness .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe genetic in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) for those patient &apos;s population only limited clinical experiences .
&quot; before the start of the therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a pre @-@ existing hypo@@ cy@@ an@@ emia is treated with a sufficient amount of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; because of the rapid influ@@ encing of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , with symp@@ tom@@ atic hy@@ po@@ kal@@ z@@ a@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient amount of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient amount of calcium , to ensure at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene ) should be weighed in a dental examination with a reasonable pre@@ emp@@ tive dent@@ ist treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who require dental treatment , no data are available if the interru@@ ption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ ates the risk of oste@@ o@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the Kiev area is reduced . &quot;
clinical evaluation by the treat@@ ise doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and are based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced by the gift of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or is@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; incidence of adverse events reported in patients who received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a were increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , Horizon - Rec@@ ur@@ ne Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , overall incidence of pre @-@ hop@@ ed between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable . &quot;
&quot; very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) un@@ wanted drug effects are listed in table 1 . &quot;
kidney disease interfer@@ ing Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic was associated with genetic disorders that is expressed as a decrease in kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum samples ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure in connection .
the change of the Kre@@ at@@ inin Clear@@ ance ( measured every year before administration ) and the occurr@@ ence of kidney failure and a limited kidney function were comparable to oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
&quot; a temporary increase in the serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients compared to placebo @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; based on the review of the laboratory findings the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mol / l ) , in a large clinical trial , compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies were treated . &quot;
&quot; all patients received sufficient quantities of vitamin D and calcium in the study to post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to prevent clinical fre@@ ading according to a hip fac@@ tions and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study on avo@@ idance of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures according to a recently sli@@ ders , the vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , however , the majority of patients received a initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions after administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a major clinical trial , more than local reactions were reported on the in@@ fusion as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the Kiev area was primarily reported in patients with cancer patients , above oste@@ o@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primarily in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ ate area ) , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omyel@@ itis , and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients or other wires . &quot;
7 study of 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients was investig@@ ating oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose in the Kiev area with a A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and a placebo @-@ treated patients .
&quot; in case of an overdose , which leads to a clin@@ ically important hy@@ po@@ kal@@ z@@ emia can be achieved by the gift of calcium calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate . &quot;
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years has been shown at post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( BM@@ D ) -@@ t Score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ as ≤ - 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral fra@@ cture .
effects on morph@@ ometric verteb@@ rates fra@@ c@@ tures were significantly over a period of three years and already after a year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ rates ( see Table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk for verteb@@ rates compared to placebo ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on the fra@@ grant fra@@ c@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a showed a permanent effect of over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased the bone density on the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ur@@ ic acid , hips and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 Incre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine increased by 6.7 % , total boo@@ sts around 6.0 % , of net weight by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius at 3.2 % . &quot;
&quot; bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , which were treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , were taken from the pel@@ vic floor after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies from the pel@@ vic floor . &quot;
a micro@@ computer @-@ computer ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed up to placebo with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients in comparison to placebo an increase in bone @-@ volume and preser@@ vation of the mac@@ ular bone @-@ architecture .
&quot; bone sales mark@@ er the bone @-@ specific phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale Pro@@ pep@@ tide of the serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum samples were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during study period . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months , significantly decreased by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value to 36 months . &quot;
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D mirrors have not measured rout@@ in@@ ely , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 , oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before the in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group . &quot;
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT @-@ study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment in comparison to placebo @-@ treatment the BM@@ D to all time points .
&quot; the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment consisted of over 24 months compared to placebo treatment to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.4 % at the total distance , and 4.3 % on the scra@@ per . &quot;
clinical efficacy in men In the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study were random@@ ized to 508 men and at 185 patients the BM@@ D was judged 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fra@@ c@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures amounted to 7.5 % at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.7 % at placebo .
&quot; in another study involving men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , an annual administration of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on was taken in comparison to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value . &quot;
clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed ( average serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2.@@ 6@@ fold up to 3.@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper standard for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in comparison to taking 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily has been demonstrated in two six months of compar@@ ative studies .
the combined results were observed after 6 months a similar decrease in pain strength and pain influenced by the initial value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified by the end of the six @-@ month main study as respon@@ der ( on the therapy ) they could be enrolled into a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; of the 143 with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach was conducted at 141 of the patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , compared to 71 who were treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate patients with a median duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application . &quot;
&quot; twice 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ etic data that proved to be dos@@ ing independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma level increased rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value to 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a prolonged period of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
ru@@ ding bi@@ phase disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ s@@ times t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ ation period of ½ to 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β with the above @-@ mentioned ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the fast res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the total dose of urine is found , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body cle@@ aring is independent from the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decline of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid concentration by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( Plas@@ ma@@ concentration around time ) .
&quot; a reduced Clear@@ ance by Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 enzyme metabolic substances is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic is not met@@ abo@@ lized - because it is a weak or even no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , fuel @-@ related inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see Section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ric acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ inin Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ inin Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
the result is that a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al function until down to a Kre@@ at@@ inin cle@@ aring up to 35 ml / min do not require a dose adjustment of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ onic acid .
&quot; for heavy ren@@ al function disorder ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only restricted data , these population are not possible for this population . &quot;
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ proof@@ ed intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; studies at dogs were administered single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al effect . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ chronic and chronic tox@@ icity in studies with intraven@@ ous application was given to the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in rats , administered as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day in@@ fusion ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ fold of the human therapeutic exposure , relative to AU@@ C , equivalent ) , well toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic effects in other organs , including Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as the intraven@@ ous injection point . &quot;
&quot; the most common denomin@@ ation in studies with repeated application was a prolifer@@ ate primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the Met@@ ap@@ hy@@ se of long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all doses , a result which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
rats observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ icity of doses ranging from 0.2 mg / kg as an outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ normal@@ ities and such of the skel@@ eton .
&quot; in rab@@ bits , no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed , although the maternal tox@@ icity was expressed in 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the hum@@ id@@ able serum @-@ calcium mirrors . &quot;

&quot; abstract of the EP@@ AR for the public , the present document is a summary of the European Public Research Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which will be evaluated as the Committee for Human@@ ist S@@ elec@@ torate ( CH@@ MP ) , in order to comply with recommendations regarding the application of the drug . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied solely ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( e.g. diabe@@ tic medicine ) can be applied along with another diabe@@ tic medicine .
&quot; additionally , it can be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which can not be satisfactory in the highest toler@@ able dose alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ osis or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff@@ er or insulin can be maintained , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of sul@@ fon@@ eth@@ ylene or insulin should be reduced . &quot;
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better toler@@ ated and the blood sugar level drops better by allowing type 2 diabetes .
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of acet@@ ate was studied in tri@@ ple@@ tion ; in addition , the patients received a combination of metal form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ite , in addition to 3.5 years of either by acet@@ ate or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance was measured in the blood ( gly@@ cem@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which shows how good the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that blood sugar levels were lowered from 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ tion study , the effect of the additional gift from Ac@@ tos in an existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sulph@@ ine har@@ n@@ um in a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c levels by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of acet@@ ate and insulin were examined in 289 patients , the patients , acet@@ ate in addition to insulin , compared with 0.@@ 14 % compared to the patients who took placebo in addition to placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were vision problems , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( diarr@@ hea ) , weight gain and hy@@ po@@ an@@ aes@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to friction ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be used either in patients who may react sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , even in patients with liver problems , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ de ( high ket@@ one mirror - acid levels ) . &quot;
&quot; it was decided that Ac@@ tos may serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , in which met@@ form@@ in is not indicated . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited , a approval for the transport of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white up to whit@@ ish , round , curved and carrying the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; ACT@@ OS . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin injec@@ tions in patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate and in@@ adequate in which met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compati@@ bly ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years , no data is available , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from the presence of at least a risk factor ( e.g. past heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or o@@ de@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac Reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed in symptoms and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and o@@ de@@ ma , if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in combination with insulin is applied . &quot;
&quot; a cardiovascular study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was performed in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus , an advanced ma@@ stic disease . &quot;
&quot; in this study , an increase of reports about cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with increased output of liver enzymes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the norm ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T mirrors up to 3 times the upper limit of the norm range are increased , the liver pressure values are as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient developed symptoms that point out to a mental dysfunction , such as un@@ clari@@ fied nausea , em@@ esis , tops of fatigue , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dar@@ ker har@@ n , are the liver enzy@@ mic values . &quot;
the decision whether treatment of patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on should be continued until the presence of the laboratory parameters of clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a dos@@ ing weight gain has been proven that can stir in fat deposits and is linked to some cases with a fluid inspection .
&quot; as a result of a hem@@ at@@ elier under the therapy of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , a minor reduction in the medium hem@@ og@@ ative value ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.1 % ) . &quot;
similar changes were observed in compar@@ ative controlled trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under metal form@@ in ( relative reduction in the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ s by about 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and for a lower extent in patients under sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff and insulin ( relative reduction in the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ s by 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one consists of patients who received pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral combination or triple combination therapy with insulin @-@ dependent therapy , the risk of a dos@@ ing @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; following the market launch , under the treatment of Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ an , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , above one appearance or a deteri@@ oration of a diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular de@@ ma , was reported . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ular de@@ ms , but the possibility of a mac@@ ular de@@ ms should be aware that patients should be considered incur@@ red in interference in vision ; an appropriate oph@@ thal@@ mic statement should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of messages undes@@ ired events concerning bone breaks of randomised , randomised , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot;
the calculated freight incidence was 1.9 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
&quot; in the PRO@@ active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years to study cardiovascular events , fra@@ c@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1,0 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication . &quot;
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if one patient wishes a pregnancy or this entry is the treatment ( see section 4.6 ) .
&quot; studies for study of inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; inter@@ actions with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ lized by these enzymes , e.g. oral contra@@ cep@@ tive , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ al@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ er inhibit@@ or are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Mi@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on to increase the 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a lowering of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to this assumption that the treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces hyper@@ trop@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the parent and reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates to the fat growth .
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from present data is not estimated to be estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change in the tower and the pul@@ sion of the lens , such as they can also be observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on the three times the upper limit of the standard area frequently appeared as frequently as placebo , but less frequently than in compar@@ ative groups under metal form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff . &quot;
in an Out@@ come study of patients with previously advanced mac@@ ular vas@@ cular disease was the frequency of a severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 1.6 % higher than under Placebo if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on bz@@ w respectively .
&quot; since the market launch was rarely reported on cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , however , if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency in the anal history . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of messages undes@@ ired events concerning bone frag@@ mentation were randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with the group @-@ treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients . &quot;
&quot; in the over a period of 3.5 years , fra@@ c@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients who were treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; taking of the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days were no symptoms . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to effect on activ@@ ating specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ ic prolifer@@ ator ) , which leads in the animal model to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat , and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
&quot; it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces glucose production in the liver , and increases peripher@@ al Glu@@ cos@@ ever@@ sion in case of insulin resistance . &quot;
a clinical study involving Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy was conducted over two years to evaluate the time until subsequent therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the start of therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was calculated by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was in@@ adequate , despite three im@@ on@@ ated optimization phase , were random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to those who continue to have insulin ; a reduction of insulin injec@@ tors in the treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a year , under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one shows a statistically significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin Qu@@ oti@@ ations compared to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , extended to 18 weeks in type 2 diabe@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical trials , compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ glyceri@@ des and the free fatty acids and a rise in HD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel as well as minor , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on fell in comparison to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de the total pl@@ as@@ mat@@ ri@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to placebo , under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was no statistically significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels , while under met@@ form@@ in and gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de decreased values were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on not only reduced the sober tri@@ glyceri@@ de , but also improved the post @-@ den@@ ounces increased tri@@ glyceri@@ de levels , and also improved the tri@@ glyceri@@ de absorption as well as on the tri@@ glyceri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ activ@@ ity@@ Study study , a cardiovascular disease , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus were random@@ ized in groups with 2 diabetes mell@@ itus in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy to either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on will quickly res@@ or@@ ates , whereby the top concentrations of un@@ changeable pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on are normally reached after 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV represents the efficacy in about the triple of the efficacy of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Mi@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ hibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) and lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after the radioactive use of radioactive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in humans , markers was found mainly in the barrels ( 55 % ) and at a lower extent in the Har@@ n ( 45 % ) . &quot;
the average plasma @-@ Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al@@ time of un@@ changeable pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on amounts to the people 5 @-@ 6 hours and that of the whole active Met@@ abol@@ ites is at 16 - 23 hours .
&quot; plasma concentration of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy subjects , although the rates of the orange cle@@ aring of the breast is similar . &quot;
&quot; in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys agreed with repet@@ ition of Plas@@ ma@@ el@@ ution enlargement , an@@ emia and reversible hyper@@ trop@@ hy . &quot;
this is due to that the treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on decreased in the gest@@ ation of hyper@@ trop@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the parent and reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fat growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( male rats ) of the ure@@ tic epi@@ thel@@ ium were induced during the rat @-@ rat ( male and female rats ) .
in a veter@@ inary model of the famili@@ al omat@@ eri@@ ous poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ an resulted in a higher frequency of col@@ ont@@ um@@ ors .

the calculated freight incidence was 1.9 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .

&quot; in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in , each with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were examined . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over 1 year , under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one shows a statistically significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin Qu@@ oti@@ ations compared to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on not only reduced tri@@ glyceri@@ de levels , but improved the post @-@ den@@ ounces increased tri@@ glyceri@@ de levels , which both have a effect on the Tr@@ y@@ gl@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as to the mental Tr@@ y@@ g@@ oni@@ eri@@ d synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study was missing in terms of its primary end@@ point , which was a combination of the overall mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal M@@ yo@@ car@@ dial syndrome , sur@@ amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ar@@ isation of Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that with taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are connected . &quot;

&quot; acet@@ ph@@ ane was found in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pan@@ cre@@ as can not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is not able to use insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; after 12 weeks in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cem@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured as well as the blood sugar level . &quot;
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror which makes it clear that blood sugar levels were similar to a different human@@ ist .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may react sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of acet@@ ph@@ ane may be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can effect on blood sugar ( the complete list is to take away ) . &quot;
the Human@@ ist Committee &apos;s Committee ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of acet@@ ph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes versus the risks .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval for the transport of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;

injection valves must be kept under the skin at least 6 seconds to ensure that the total dose was in@@ jected .
&quot; patients whose blood glucose can be improved significantly , for example , through a intensi@@ fied insulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ warning symptoms can be perceived and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ phase , long @-@ acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) can result in that a change of dosage is required . &quot;
&quot; in case of switching to acet@@ ph@@ ane , a dose adap@@ tion is necessary , it may be necessary for the first dosage or during the first weeks or months after conversion . &quot;

&quot; if the ur@@ inary acid level is still over 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ant , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment of treatment , children can still occur ; therefore it is recommended that patients have at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic even further medicines for the prevention of tox@@ ic@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; the medicine is not recommended in children and patients who had an organ transplan@@ t , because it was not investigated for these groups . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , on which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy three of various Aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( a different drug for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ a@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied to a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems were only 100 mg per day . &quot;
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary acid level was in the blood in the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl .
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of the patients , the Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 from 269 ) of patients who are once daily 120 mg , with the last three measurements an ure@@ acid levels in the blood of under 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and no one of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed during 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diarr@@ hea , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; especially in patients with heart complaints in the history , possibly an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the fact that Aden@@ ur@@ ic reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the lowering of the ur@@ inary acid in the blood , but also a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels could be found . &quot;
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ a@@ emia which have already led to primitive deposits ( including one from the story of history known or currently present Gi@@ cht@@ el@@ ea ) .
&quot; if the ser@@ um@@ per@@ n@@ acid level is still valid after 2 @-@ 4 weeks and still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) , a dose increase to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily can be considered . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney problems , the efficacy and safety are not fully studied ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and young@@ sters there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients . &quot;
&quot; organ transplan@@ ts are no experiences yet with organ transplan@@ ts , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ a@@ cardiovascular disease or de@@ com@@ promised cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency the treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; as with other har@@ ness su@@ cking pharmac@@ euticals , it may occur during the treatment coming to an acute tox@@ icity , because due to lowering the serum @-@ acid mirror , in the initial ure@@ acid deposits , can be mobil@@ ised in the tissue . &quot;
&quot; B. with mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , L@@ esch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine happens so far so far , that it comes to a break in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; liver disease During the phase 3 clinical trials were observed , the liver function of the liver function was observed with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ ate patients ( 3.5 % ) . &quot;
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function before the start of Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ static treatment and further development ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ was performed no interaction studies to Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at ; but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ or can lead to a rise in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ liner ( a inhibit@@ ing of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ or ) .
&quot; subjects were also associated with an increase in Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ering and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 times a day with a rise in Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ ute ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the application of Nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors did not exist in connection with a clinical significant increase of undes@@ ired events . &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at can be applied together with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or in@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without means a dose adap@@ tion for Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at or simultaneously used other ingredient is required .
&quot; in a study with subjects , 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily showed a mean 22 % increase in AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , which indicates a possible weak effect of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
Ant@@ azi@@ da It could be shown that magnesium hydro@@ xide and aluminum hydro@@ xide containing the intake of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ath ( about 1 hour ) has delayed and a decline in the C@@ max by 32 % but does not cause any significant change in AU@@ C .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ an@@ cies do not let side effects of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at to pregnancy or health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
&quot; animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful when taxes of a vehicle , serving machines or exercise of dangerous activities , except they can be reas@@ onably sure that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not affect their performance . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in the P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statistically significant differences were found , no statistically significant differences could be detected . &quot;
the risk factors in these patients were an arter@@ i@@ os@@ cler@@ otic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ suffici@@ ency or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the nurse .
&quot; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) side effects , which could be recorded in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at and were listed in all Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once , are listed below . &quot;
diarr@@ hea , nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In clinical trials were observed no heavy skin rash or severe overseas reactions . &quot;
&quot; 7 open long @-@ term renewal studies In the open long @-@ time extension studies , 906 patients up to 1 year long , 322 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients treated with Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
during the long @-@ term - renewal studies reported previously untreated events were similar to those reported in the phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all Feb@@ ral treatment groups , more than once and compet@@ ed in patients who received Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term renewal studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the data . &quot;
the following untreated events were either not reported in the P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al studies of the phase 3 for these doses or at a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hyp@@ aes@@ thes@@ ia , bl@@ ero@@ sion , rash , bul@@ sit@@ is , genetic dysfunction , kidney disease , genetic dysfunction , increase in lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , decrease of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ c@@ cy@@ tes , decrease in the number of white blood cells . &quot;
mechanism ur@@ inary acid is the end product of the Pur@@ in@@ metabolic syndrome and arises within the reaction of the reaction ask@@ ade Hy@@ po@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
&quot; Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at is a powerful , non @-@ sel@@ ective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ X@@ O ) with an Ki @-@ value for in vitro @-@ inhibit@@ or , which is below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar area . &quot;
clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two p@@ iv@@ ot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX trial and F@@ ACT study as described below ) that were carried out with hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in any study the proportion of patients in which the last three month is certain serum levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) .
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 132 ) or Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 132 ) or 100 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with an incre@@ mental value of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily , the AP@@ EX study showed statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional used doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) . &quot;
the F@@ ACT study showed statistically significant su@@ pre@@ macy of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional used dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with ser@@ en@@ circles values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 509 ) were sum@@ med for the analyses . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg . &quot;
in the doctor &apos;s visit to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) it was observed during the doctor visit in week 2 and permanently maintain the entire treatment .
509 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x a day ; 10 patients with ser@@ en@@ cir@@ at@@ in@@ values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 times a day .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al @-@ term restriction of the AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney @-@ restriction ( d. h .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients . &quot;
&quot; there were no clin@@ ically significant differences concerning the percentage of ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of its kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney disorders ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / d@@ ote E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years of the open extension study of the phase 3 showed that less than 3 % of patients had a decrease in the months of 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients had no treatment against a pois@@ ons ) .
&quot; this was associated with a reduction of pois@@ oning no@@ des , which in 54 % of patients had a complete disappearance of the g@@ no@@ des up to a month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also received in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long time extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plasma tor@@ ch curve time curve ( AU@@ C ) of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at to administration easier and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional . &quot;
&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , the AU@@ C is observed for Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at , which is greater than the dos@@ ing proportional increase . &quot;
after taking simple or multi @-@ pler doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ max amounts to approximately 2.8 @-@ 3,2 µg / ml and 5,0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml .
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decrease in the serum concentration of serum concentration was observed ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady state volume ( V@@ SS / F ) of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at is from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plasma connection of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary li@@ aison to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is reached over the concentration width of 80 and 120 mg , constant . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ ites , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 are formed mainly through U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C mark@@ ed Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at , 49 % of the dose in urine were found ( 3 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ ed id of the drug ( 30 % ) , whose known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and as further unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose is found in the chair as un@@ changeable Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ kur@@ on@@ id of the drug ( 1 % ) , whose known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) and as further unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multi@@ pler doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe genetic in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ max of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at were not changed in relation to test subjects with normal kidney function . &quot;
&quot; the average total AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at increased by about the 1.8 @-@ fold of 7,5 m / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 m / ml in the group with severe kidney function . &quot;
&quot; 12 liver Con@@ duc@@ ing After taking multiple sclerosis of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ Pu@@ gh classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh classification A ) or medium @-@ duty ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh classification A ) , and its metabol@@ ites is not significantly reduced compared to subjects with normal liver function . &quot;
age There were no significant changes related to AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at or its metabolism after taking multiple sclerosis oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of the fermentation in male rats , was found statistically significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder ( trans@@ itional cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ oma ) in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dosed group , where 11 times the exposure of people found . &quot;
&quot; as a consequence , these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ pose and Ur@@ ine composition as a consequence of clinical application and not relevant for clinical application . &quot;
it was noted that Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fermentation and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
&quot; at high doses , which occurred approximately at 4.@@ 3 times of human therapeutic exposure , maternal tox@@ icity , which entered with a lowering performance and a development delay in the offspring of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in supporting rats with ex@@ positions that were about 4.3 times and in traditional rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions that were about 13 times of human therapeutic exposure , there were no ter@@ o@@ gens effects . &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at can be applied together with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or in@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without means a dose adap@@ tion for Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at or simultaneously used other ingredient is required .

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bone frag@@ ile ) is used in women after men@@ opause , in which a risk of low vitamin D mirrors exists . &quot;
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking , or use of other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitality ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not take up until after the first food intake of the day , which should not be done at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and vitamin D3 have already been used separate from each other in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to detect the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase of vitamin D levels . &quot;
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with the patients who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than those who were exclusively dedicated to alt@@ en@@ dr@@ ate income ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also submitted data from which the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , exactly the dose that is needed for preventing bon@@ net loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of the movement apparatus ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sy ( diarr@@ hea ) , ul@@ cers , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ ho@@ ea ) , ul@@ cers ( bl@@ amed belly ) as well as sau@@ cers . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , vitamin D3 or other components it must not be applied to AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in cases of es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium level ) or in patients who are not at least 30 minutes standing upright . &quot;

&quot; Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sion , were rarely reported in patients under the in@@ gest@@ ion of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( partially these severe and required hospitals ) . &quot;
&quot; doctor should therefore consider att@@ enti@@ vely to all signs and symptoms that are to be pointed out on any mal@@ ign@@ ant reactions , and the patients should be pointed out at the occurr@@ ence of symp@@ tom of mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ spher@@ es , pain in swal@@ lowing or new or intensi@@ fied so@@ lic@@ as ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe mal@@ ign@@ ant side effects seems to be increased in patients , that use the medicine will not be correct and / or after the occurr@@ ence of symptoms resulting in mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all dos@@ ing assign@@ ments to the patient will be performed and understood from the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; during large @-@ scale clinical trials with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was determined , rare ( according to market release ) stomach and du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , reported ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;

&quot; there are no data available to indicate whether the ab@@ etting of a bis@@ phosph@@ onate therapy in patients who require a j@@ aw surgery , reduces the risk of a oste@@ o@@ gene expression . &quot;
clinical assessment by the treat@@ ise doctor is crucial for the therapy planning for each patient on the basis of an individual benefit risk assessment .
&quot; patients should be instructed by taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to take the tablet in the next morning , after having noticed their failure . &quot;
&quot; you should not take two tablets on the same day , but taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the planned week@@ day . &quot;
other diseases resulting from the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated at the beginning of the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can affect the absorption of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at if they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients have to wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not performed , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken together in clinical trials with a variety of usually prescribed medicines without being clin@@ ically relevant drug inter@@ actions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only fore@@ seen for the use of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore neither during pregnancy nor to contact women .
&quot; animal studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at have no indication of being shown directly to the pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose of the j@@ aw was reported in patients under Bis@@ phosph@@ onate , but most reports date from cancer patients , however , was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the serum samples took up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mol / l ) and the serum and phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mol / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;

&quot; main Indi@@ c@@ ator of the efficacy was the number of patients , where the transplan@@ ts was cancelled after a treatment duration of a year ( by example , for example , how often a new organ transplan@@ t or recovery of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , there were more recent studies on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t and patients with liver transplan@@ t performed and exam@@ ining such as Ad@@ vaginal raf in comparison to pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft from the body . &quot;

&quot; in a sequence of transition to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic medication monitoring and corresponding dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us remains . &quot;
the dosage of ad@@ vag@@ raf should be based on clinical assessment of shock and toler@@ ability in individual cases and based on blood levels ( see below .
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vaginal , the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ s should be checked in front of the conversion and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; on Day 4 , systemic exposure was measured as a valley level , with both formulation both in kidney and liver @-@ treated patients . &quot;
careful and repeated checks of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ s are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation in Ad@@ vag@@ raf to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate after@@ treatment phase .
&quot; since T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low cle@@ aring , an adaptation of the ad@@ vag@@ raf @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as last more days , until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition is not allowed in the first postoperative phase , the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us treatment is administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate on the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) . &quot;
&quot; duration of the application to supp@@ ression of gra@@ ft , the immune supp@@ ression has to be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy is not specified . &quot;
dose recommendations - Kid@@ ney transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of the oral Ad@@ vaginal sex therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; further dos@@ ages can be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of patients after transplan@@ tation . &quot;
dose recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft reactions should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; Dos@@ age recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf must be used to take a gra@@ ft dose of twice daily dose of Pro@@ vag@@ raf , so this change@@ over to a daily dose of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ t After a change@@ over of other immune supp@@ res@@ s@@ si@@ va on ad@@ vag@@ raf once daily must begin the treatment with the liver transplan@@ tation recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ tation .
&quot; heart transplan@@ t For adult patients , which are turned on ad@@ y@@ raf , is an oral Initi@@ al dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day once a day . &quot;
&quot; other gra@@ ft recei@@ vers have no clinical experience with Ad@@ vaginal sex in lung , pan@@ cre@@ as and dar@@ m@@ transplan@@ t patients , in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in a oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and for intestinal transplan@@ ts in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
canned adap@@ t@@ ages in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining blood cells in the targeted range can be required for patients with severe liver disorders a decrease of the dose .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function As the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , can be assumed that a dose is not necessary . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful surveillance of ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the serum levels of serum levels , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and a monitoring of the urine volume ) is recommended . &quot;
change@@ over to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Ad@@ vag@@ raf At the change@@ over of a c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is caution ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the valley @-@ mirror in full blood . the dose should be based on clinical assessment of shock and toler@@ ability in individual case using solid blood @-@ t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ angle controls .
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ valley , during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during the maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood @-@ valley @-@ level of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us should also change after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vaginal Therap@@ y , Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tion , changes to immune supp@@ res@@ sive therapy or for simultaneous use of substances which could change the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as Ad@@ vaginal Sex is a medicine with a low cle@@ aring , adap@@ t@@ ations of the dose may need more days until the Ste@@ ady State represents . &quot;
&quot; the data in clinical studies suggest that a successful treatment is possible in most cases , if the valley is not exceeded in the blood 20 ng / ml . &quot;
in clinical practice the valley @-@ level of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us usually lie in the first time after liver transplan@@ t@@ ations usually in the area of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in warm transplan@@ t patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent ti@@ cking therapy of liver and kidney transplan@@ ts were generally used in the range of blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml .
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events including transplan@@ ts and other side effects , which may occur in a sequence of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; amendments to the formulation or the regime should only be done under the nar@@ row@@ ful control of an transplan@@ tation of experienced medical devices ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft of gra@@ ft , which has been shown to other immun@@ os@@ prey as therapy , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ ated formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; at the proph@@ yla@@ xis , transplan@@ ts in adult heart transplan@@ ts and transplan@@ ts in child age are still not yet clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ ated formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; because of possible inter@@ actions that can lead to a decrease of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us levels in the blood and a down@@ turn of the clinical effect of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , the in@@ gest@@ ion of herbal supplements ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) can be avoided ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diarr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentrations in blood is offered since the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us blood level can be subjected to major fluctu@@ ations in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , as a cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy , chamber or sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ trop@@ hy was observed , which can therefore occur under ad@@ vag@@ anza . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver disorders , infections , fluid over@@ load and oils . &quot;
&quot; as with other immune supp@@ res@@ s@@ si@@ va , the interaction of sunlight or UV light should be restricted to suitable clothing or use of a solar protection with a high protective factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who use T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us take symptoms for pre@@ aches like head@@ aches , change consciousness , sei@@ zu@@ res and vision problems , should have a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. ) . &quot;
&quot; da Ad@@ vag@@ raf hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ zed , l@@ act@@ ose is included in patients with the rare her@@ ed@@ itary g@@ act@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption special caution . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of drugs or vegetable heal@@ ers , which are known as inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can increase the metabolism of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us and therefore reduce blood values of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is advis@@ able to monitor the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood level of substances that can change CY@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism , to monitor the CY@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism , to monitor the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain even higher concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly pronounced interaction with An@@ tim@@ y@@ cott such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ con@@ az@@ ole and Vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole and the Macro@@ id antibiot@@ ic ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin and HIV @-@ prot@@ eas@@ ant ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels mainly from the increased genital bio@@ availability of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , due to inhibit@@ or of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal combustion , results . &quot;
high @-@ engine@@ ered pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one as it is used in acute abor@@ tions can raise the concentration of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us in the blood or lower .
&quot; impact of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous application of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can be met@@ abo@@ lized by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , their metabolism . &quot;
&quot; since T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us reduce the cle@@ aring of ster@@ oid contra@@ cep@@ tive and thus increasing the hormone exposure , it is particularly careful with decisions on recep@@ tive measures . &quot;
the results of animal experiments have shown that T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us potentially decrease the cle@@ aring of Pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ one and extend their half @-@ value .
&quot; the results of a small number of investigations on transplan@@ tation consultants provide no indication of that under T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , compared to other immune supp@@ res@@ si@@ va , increased risk of adverse events regarding the course and the result of pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; in u@@ ter@@ o exposure , monitoring of new@@ bor@@ ns causes potential adverse effects of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
&quot; it exists the risk of early birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ co@@ al@@ a@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;

&quot; listed below are the side effects following their frequency in the order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency on the basis of available data is not estimated to be estimated ) . &quot;

cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ related N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ co@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ otherapy treatment including therapy with Ad@@ vaginal sex .
it was reported over ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ op@@ las@@ men including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymph@@ opro@@ lifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ours in conjunction with T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; because of its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high bond of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins can be assumed that T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; the effect of action and a dynamic effects on molecular level , the effects of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us may be convey@@ ed by his li@@ aison to a cy@@ tos@@ tic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cellular nu@@ cle@@ us . &quot;
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ ary @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of be@@ alt@@ ran@@ s@@ duction for in the T cell and prevents tran@@ scription of a certain range of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .

&quot; the results of the primary immune supp@@ ression with T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us was developed twice daily , according to other primary transplan@@ ts in the form of pan@@ cre@@ as , lung and intestinal transplan@@ t@@ ations in the form twice daily . &quot;
&quot; 175 patients , in 4@@ 75 patients , underwent a pan@@ cre@@ atic transplan@@ t , and in 630 cases were used as a primary immun@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ grave in these published studies reported the observations in the large studies in which pro@@ gra@@ f at liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts were used to primary immun@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; lung transplan@@ t In a intermediate analysis over a recently performed , multic@@ enter study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f has been reported over 110 patients that received either T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 @-@ Rand@@ om@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; chronic transplan@@ ts , bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis was obl@@ iter@@ ated , was observed in the first year after transplan@@ tation less frequently ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; survival rate after a year was 8@@ 0,8 % in the acro@@ economic and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) . &quot;
in the patients treated with T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us patients it came into 2@@ 1,7 % of cases to the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis in the comparison to 3@@ 8.0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
&quot; the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) , was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) when the number of patients who were raised by T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases , in which there were no acute transplan@@ ts , was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.7 % versus 4@@ 5.8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the l@@ ung@@ ated patients of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us group larger ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 511 ) . &quot;
in a study the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis was obl@@ iter@@ ated - Syn@@ dro@@ ms tested in the patients with T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us patients .
&quot; pan@@ cre@@ w@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation A multic@@ enter study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed in 205 patients , which simultaneously received pan@@ cre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ t , based on a randomised procedures T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) . &quot;
the oral initi@@ alling ( per protocol ) by T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was followed after reaching the stretched valley levels of 8 to 15 ng / ml per 5 .
&quot; rec@@ tal transplan@@ t The published clinical results of a mono@@ cent@@ ric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ ft study showed 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ines , 75 liver and intest@@ ines and 25 multi @-@ vis@@ cer@@ al transplan@@ ts ) among T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us and pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one an update rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;

&quot; factors such as low hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit@@ es and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the un@@ bound group of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , or a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids are supposed to be responsible for transplan@@ tation observed higher Clear@@ ance rates . &quot;
&quot; this suggests that T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely met@@ abo@@ lized before the ex@@ cre@@ tion , with the ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly via the g@@ all . &quot;
&quot; for stable patients who were converted from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) on Ad@@ vag@@ raf ( once daily ) at a ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , the systemic exposure of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ valley , during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during the maintenance therapy . &quot;

&quot; adv@@ ances is a different in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , similar , but is different , so that the drug contains no proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies of patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , among them a study involving 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was investigated by preventing bleeding and surgical intervention . &quot;
in the main study the efficacy of Adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood vessels were awarded with &quot; excellent &quot; and with &quot; good &quot; .
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are dizziness , headache , py@@ rex@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ances should not be applied in patients , possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against human od@@ ulation factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster protein , or other components . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG approval for placing Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy is based on the sever@@ ity of a factor VIII @-@ mania , after the place and the extent of bleeding and clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
&quot; at the following h@@ ul@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , a factor VIII activity in the respective period does not fall under the specified plasma level ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / dl ) . &quot;
injection of every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute constra@@ ints are removed .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk is over for the patient .
&quot; during treatment , the injec@@ tion@@ able dose and frequency of injec@@ tions require a reasonable determination of the factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ hal@@ ation factor . &quot;
&quot; individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo Recovery and have different half @-@ value times . &quot;
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis For long term proph@@ yla@@ xis in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII plasma activity cannot be reached , or if the blood flow is not ruled with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed to rec@@ al@@ im@@ itate an inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that a factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be weighed . &quot;
&quot; the administration speed should be addressed after the patient , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing Anti@@ bodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
&quot; these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII , Ig@@ G Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which is quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml of plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da Ass@@ ay . &quot;
&quot; developing the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ relate with the magn@@ itude of exposure to the factor VIII , with the risk within the first 20 exclusive days of the largest and of genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ ne@@ tically unknown In@@ hibit@@ ory development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the restart of ( low tit@@ ular ) inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurr@@ ence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast@@ feeding . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s had an inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) that have previously untreated patients who have previously untreated patients , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and dizziness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency on the basis of available data is not estimated to be estimated ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) . the unexpected waste of blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII @-@ mir@@ s was post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10th - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively ) in one patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ung was stopped during the whole time and both factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - Mir@@ rors in Plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values on the 15 post @-@ operative day .

&quot; moreover , no of the 53 p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients was diagnosed with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) to previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ate ( ≥ 50 days ) of a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in previously untreated patients of a current clinical study evaluated 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients against factor VIII . &quot;
the immune response of the patients on traces of contam@@ inated proteins was analyzed by the investigation of antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend and persistent peak of anti @-@ Ch@@ o cell protein , otherwise no signs or symptoms occur to an allergic reaction or hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity . &quot;

&quot; based on the specifications available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP has continued to be a positive value as a positive , but in consideration that the safety profile of the following reasons must be closely monitored : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP is based on the basis of the security filter of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which requires a filing of P@@ SU@@ Rs every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another renewal in 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited announced the Committee for Human@@ itarian Aid ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company returns its application for the treatment of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer . &quot;
&quot; normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the wheat parts ( tissues , which combines other structures in the body , re@@ covers and leans ) . &quot;
&quot; it is a type of virus , which was genetically modified , that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body . &quot;
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus , &quot; which has been changed so that there is no copies of themselves , and therefore no infections can trigger in humans . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ent would have in@@ jected directly into the tum@@ ors , enabling cancer cells to make the normal p@@ 53 protein again . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein produced from which non @-@ def@@ ensive in the human body is made of p@@ 53 gene , normally contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells , if the DNA can &apos;t be restored . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company submitted data from a study involving a patient , with the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of the under@@ mining , into the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after CH@@ MP tested the company &apos;s answers to the questions provided , there were still some questions un@@ explained . &quot;
&quot; based on the evaluation of the initial documentation , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions which will be sent to the company . &quot;
&quot; according to CH@@ MP opinion , it has not been sufficiently proven that the injection of Adv@@ ance in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ tum@@ ors will take advantage of the patients . &quot;
the committee also concerns concerns relating to the medicine in the body ; the type of administration as well as the safety of the medicine .
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently proven that adv@@ ances can be made in reliable ways , and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient are harmful . &quot;
&quot; the company , the CH@@ MP did not know whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who currently participated in clinical trials or &quot; comp@@ assi@@ onate &quot; &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in . &quot;
&quot; changed drug @-@ release &quot; means that the tablets are so assembled , that one of the effective components is immediately released and the other slowly released over a few hours . &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ aze is used for treating the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fever bli@@ sters inflammation of the nas@@ al infections ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cu@@ ous membran@@ es ( c@@ logged nose ) .
&quot; in adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ aze is a tablet twice daily , which should be taken with a glass of water or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible , as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nose s@@ mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be applied upon the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
basic components were the changes of the sever@@ ity of the Heu@@ ck symptoms that were reported from the patients before the start of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms all 12 hours into a journal and evaluated by a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; considering all loc@@ u@@ pf@@ u@@ pf@@ ul@@ ant symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients , the Aer@@ in@@ aze &apos;s income , over a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patients who p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the Nas@@ en@@ s@@ mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients showed a reduction of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who own des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ aze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , dizziness , psych@@ om@@ ot@@ or@@ rh@@ ine hyper@@ activity ( lack of pain ) , con@@ sti@@ pulation , headache , fatigue , insom@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ jection ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ aze may not be sensitive to patients who may be overweight ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin , or one of the other ingredients , against ad@@ ren@@ ean active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another drug for the treatment of aller@@ gies ) are not applied . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ aze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a bott@@ len@@ angle glaucoma ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ nia ( hyper@@ tension ) or hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , or already a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( hyper@@ tension ) , or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted approval by the company SP Europe for placing Aer@@ in@@ aze of the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , it is all to swal@@ low ( i.e. without them to dis@@ close or cut ) . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ aze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data to the un@@ think@@ able and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after ab@@ etting the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as for long @-@ term application the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin can be removed with time . &quot;
&quot; following decline of swelling of mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory tract , treatment can be continued with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; da Aer@@ in@@ aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin contains , the medicine is also contra@@ sted with patients who are treated with a mon@@ o@@ amin@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) or inhibit@@ or , or within 2 weeks after termination of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combination of P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ din , Per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , Di@@ hydro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other Dec@@ on@@ gest@@ iv@@ a , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , ep@@ he@@ drin , Oxy@@ me@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ h@@ olin , etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; safety and efficacy of combination therapy were not checked for this patient collection , and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate recommendations . &quot;
safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ aze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function and does not submit the data to address appropriate recommendations .
&quot; patients must be informed about the treatment that the treatment of hyper@@ tension , or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mia , arr@@ hyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea , or any other neurolog@@ ical symp@@ tom ( such as head aches or ampli@@ fication of head@@ aches ) must be set . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of the following patient groups will be careful : • Pati@@ ents with cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension , patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction in the anal history , diabetes mell@@ itus , bladder cancer , or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus in the anal history . &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ aze is ab@@ duc@@ ed at least 48 hours before carrying out der@@ mat@@ ological tests as anti@@ hist@@ amine otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or to reduce their extent .
&quot; in the scope of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in which Ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were also given , however , no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or changes of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed . &quot;
&quot; with the results of the psych@@ om@@ ot@@ or tests no significant differences could be detected between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the placebo @-@ treated patients , regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone or alcohol was taken . &quot;
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin responsible enzyme was not identified yet so that drug inter@@ actions can not be excluded from other medicines .
&quot; des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a sub@@ strate , nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ think@@ able of the use of Aer@@ in@@ aze during pregnancy is not secured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase in the frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities in comparison to the frequency of the normal population . &quot;
&quot; as the reproductive studies of animals cannot always be transferred to humans and should not be applied to the basis of vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ving properties of P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin , Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be applied in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should however be clari@@ fied that in very rare cases it can come to a drow@@ sin@@ ess that can lead to an impair@@ ment of traffic noise or ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( dation , ap@@ nea , decreased spiritual attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular coll@@ aps ) and a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , stair@@ cases ) with possible let@@ es . &quot;
&quot; headache , anxiety , stress @-@ values , muscle weak@@ nesses and increased muscle ten@@ se , eu@@ ph@@ oria , emot@@ ion , nausea , vomiting , cor@@ dial pain , dizziness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , bl@@ ur@@ red vision and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia . &quot;
&quot; a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation is particularly likely in children , as well as At@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth dry , pup@@ il rigid and di@@ lat@@ ation , skin comfort , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the inhibit@@ or of the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ ths / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es and inhibit@@ ing expression of the expression of the expression of Ad@@ ult P @-@ sel@@ ess to end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose of adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes , including rein@@ forcement of sub@@ jective drow@@ sin@@ ess or tasks that are connected to the flies . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. a day no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess was observed in comparison to placebo . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin in the recommended dosage can cause more sympath@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ onic or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S exc@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; it took 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis , with 4@@ 14 patients with Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies the hist@@ am@@ ant@@ agon@@ ist efficacy of aer@@ in@@ aze tablets , determined by the overall co@@ res for the symp@@ tom@@ atic ( except nas@@ al mu@@ cu@@ ous swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets related to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ite s@@ well@@ ings , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets showed significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin , no significant differences . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ aze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ aze with healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow @-@ weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin was reached on Day 10 . &quot;
&quot; in the context of an pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ etic multi @-@ dos@@ cop@@ ic study , which was performed with the formulation of healthy adult subjects , was found that four subjects Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine mis@@ erable . &quot;
a component @-@ interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin after the sole gift of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ in bio@@ equivalent was to exposure to the gift of an Aer@@ in@@ aze Tabl@@ ette .
&quot; based on conventional studies for safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , Tox@@ icity at repeated gift , for gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and reproduction , the pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine does not recognize any special dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no larger tox@@ icity as their individual components , and the observed effects were generally in connection with the ingredients P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin . &quot;
&quot; in reproductive @-@ core studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine / P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin was the oral gift of rats at a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day . &quot;

&quot; for children aged between one and five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or respectively . &quot;
&quot; for children ages six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or respectively . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis , and two studies of patients who also had asthma ) . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy was measured by the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of squares , impair@@ ment of sleep and the performance on days ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies were presented to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , to remove the solution and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of symp@@ tom ( symp@@ tom count ) by 25 to 26 % , compared to the decline of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies of Ur@@ tik@@ aria the acceptance of the symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or other components . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission granted approval by the company SP Europe for placing A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; a tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience from clinical trials to efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
&quot; the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( symptoms of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out accordingly to the previous disease , and may occur after the sound of the symptoms . &quot;
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ( symptoms of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended during the treatment of continuous treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant interaction between clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets are not detected in addition to which ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were also given in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , Herceptin is not to be enhanced by A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should however be clari@@ fied that in very rare cases it can occur in very rare cases that can lead to a impair@@ ment of traffic noise or ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; most commonly found adverse events , reported more common than in placebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , mouth dry ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial of 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common minor effect of headache was treated with 9 % of patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and treated with 6.9 % of patients who were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , where up to 45 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were given , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the inhibit@@ ing of pro@@ spective cy@@ to@@ kin@@ es such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ ths / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es and inhibit@@ ing expression of the expression of the expression of Ad@@ ult cells to end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multi @-@ outlets , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dosage of up to 20 m@@ g. a day was administered over 14 days a day , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect has been described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in a single dos@@ is@@ - study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement ranges of the flight output including the rein@@ forcement of sub@@ jective drow@@ sin@@ ess or tasks that are connected to the flies . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in preventing symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ ennial , allergic rhin@@ itis can also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the appearance of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as seen from the overall co@@ res of the questionnaire to life of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively decreased the absorption of allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was evaluated as representative for further forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is im@@ perc@@ ei@@ vable in different forms and chronic patients can be rec@@ tively recruited . &quot;
&quot; since the history of hist@@ amine is a urs@@ ing factor in all ur@@ inary diseases , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is also expected to improve the symptoms of the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria in other forms of the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the decrease of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ amine in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of the patients that did not react to anti@@ hist@@ amine were excluded . &quot;
improvement of the it@@ iner@@ ary of more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine treated patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep , and wa@@ vering considerably , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to assess this variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients have been comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis population , a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was achieved in 4 % of patients . &quot;
there are no indications of a clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; the enzyme , however , was not identified for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin responsible , so that inter@@ actions with other medicines will not be excluded . &quot;
&quot; des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo , non @-@ CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a sub@@ strate , nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; in a single dos@@ cop@@ ic study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dos@@ ing of 7.5 mg , meals ( fet@@ al , low @-@ cal@@ ory breakfast ) is not based on the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the clinical trials published with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ adin , at a comparable grade of the exposure of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no qualitative or quantitative differences concerning the tox@@ icity of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and from Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeat@@ ability , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and reproduction , the pre @-@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine have no particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; color film ( contains l@@ act@@ ose @-@ mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , hy@@ pro@@ m@@ less , titanium dioxide , Macro@@ oc@@ ar@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , colour@@ less film ( contains hy@@ pro@@ m@@ less , Macro@@ o@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , light wax . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to reduce the symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the prescription doctor should be aware that most cases of Rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data are available , which support a treatment of infectious rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ic anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis , physical examination , and corresponding laboratory studies and skin investigations should play a role . &quot;
&quot; for about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years , metabolic des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is restricted and experienced a higher sub@@ load load ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the security of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up with children between 2 and 11 years , which is fully met@@ abo@@ lized - is identical to children who will be met@@ abo@@ lized . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains suc@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ ed@@ itary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose , in@@ suffici@@ ency or in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medication should not be taken . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interaction between clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets are not detected in addition to which ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were also given in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , Herceptin and alcohol was not enhanced by using A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
overall incidence of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group like the placebo group .
&quot; clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an adult dose of adults and adolescents , who were given up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
children aged between 1 and 11 years who came to question for an anti@@ hist@@ amine dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 ) .
because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults and children can be similar to the efficacy data from Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults with children &apos;s population .
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dosage of up to 20 m@@ g. a day was applied for 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect has been described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. daily for adults and adolescents , there was no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an individual daily dose of 7,5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets resulted in adults and adolescents in clinical trials with no impair@@ ment of the psych@@ om@@ ot@@ oric . &quot;
&quot; in pharmac@@ ologically @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , it was not possible to increase alcohol induced or ampli@@ fication of alcohol induced power ampli@@ fication even to an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adult and young patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in preventing symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as using the overall co@@ res of the questionnaire to life quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively boo@@ sted the seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the decrease of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this restricted metabolic phen@@ otyp@@ s was comparable with adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than at Caucas@@ ia ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ etic multi @-@ dose study with sy@@ rup form@@ ulating in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis , which can be restricted . &quot;
&quot; the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was approximately 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours , and the C@@ max approximately 3 to 4@@ times higher with a season half @-@ value of about 120 hours . &quot;
there are no indications of a clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient cum@@ ulation after a daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
&quot; 12 In different single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were comparable to p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients with those recommended doses were comparable to those of adults who received a lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme , however , was not identified for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin responsible , so that inter@@ actions with other medicines will not be excluded . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up is offered in type III Bra@@ ung@@ sters bottles with child @-@ safe polypropylene end cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;
&quot; equipped with a rigid , transparent pol@@ ystyrene measuring sco@@ op , cali@@ br@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with an application injection for inser@@ tion with a scale of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for the 150 ml bottle ) . &quot;
&quot; a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at once daily put in the mouth , to relie@@ ve symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster needs to be carefully opened and the dose of the Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ats must be taken without damage . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interaction with A@@ eri@@ us tablets were not detected in the scope of clinical trials including ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , than in patients who were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , where up to 45 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were applied , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at has been well toler@@ ated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory tests , medical examinations , display signs and EC@@ G intervals . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multi @-@ outlets , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dosage of up to 20 m@@ g. a day was applied for 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect has been described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was applied for ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. a day no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess was observed in comparison to placebo . &quot;
&quot; at a 17 single dose of adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard - measuring sizes , including rein@@ forcement of sub@@ jective drow@@ sin@@ ess or tasks that are connected to the flies . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in preventing symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as seen from the overall co@@ res of the questionnaire to life of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively decreased the absorption of allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; 18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients had been comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis population , a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was achieved in 4 % of patients . &quot;

&quot; two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets once daily put in the mouth , to relie@@ ve symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience from clinical trials to efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
&quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melting tablet are taken , without damage . &quot;
the effectiveness and un@@ think@@ able of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of processed tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been detected so far .
the overall incidence of side effects between the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine Sir@@ up@@ - and the placebo group was equal and with@@ drew not significantly from the safety profile in adult patients .
&quot; in the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us processed tablets had to be used as bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at for business formulation of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multi @-@ outlets , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dosage of up to 20 m@@ g. a day was applied for 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose of adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard - measuring sizes , including rein@@ forcement of sub@@ jective drow@@ sin@@ ess or tasks that are connected to the flies . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this badly met@@ alli@@ zing phen@@ otyp@@ s was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % , children 16 % ) , but the safety profile of these patients was not absent from the general population . &quot;
in single dose crossover studies by A@@ eri@@ us processed tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at were the formulation of the bio@@ equivalent .
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not investigated at p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients , however , in combination with the Dos@@ age studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ genetic data can support the use of 2.5 mg dosage with children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;

&quot; in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in preventing symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
in single dose crossover studies by A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of mel@@ tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at were the formulation of the bio@@ equivalent .
the overall analysis of pre @-@ clinical and clinical development tests for the melting tray revealed that these formulation is an unlikely risk for local irrit@@ ations in clinical use .
&quot; the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in children between 2 and 11 years , which is fully met@@ abo@@ lized - is identical with children who will be met@@ abo@@ lized . &quot;

overall incidence of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine group like the placebo group .
&quot; children between 6 and 23 months were the most common adverse events that reported more common than placebo , diarr@@ hea ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and insom@@ nia ( 2,3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , a single @-@ one dose of 2.5 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine solution have been observed no side effects in patients at the age between 6 and 11 years . &quot;
&quot; at the recommended doses , the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable to children and adults . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. daily for adults and adolescents , there was no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ ennial , allergic rhin@@ itis may vary depending on the symptoms of symptoms alternatively in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and &quot;

&quot; in June 2008 , Nov@@ art@@ is V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. was officially distributed to the Committee for Human@@ itarian Aid ( CH@@ MP ) that the company returns its application for the prevention of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N1 influenza in adults and older people . &quot;
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people to protect flu caused by the stem ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of influenza A virus .
&quot; this is a special kind of vaccine , which could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic that might cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; influenza pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus , which can easily spread from human beings , because humans still have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; according to administration , the immune system det@@ ects the immune system contained in the vaccine of the Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus as &quot; physical &quot; and forms antibodies . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system is able to form a free antibody in contact with a Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , membran@@ es of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which det@@ ects the human body as body foreign ) , was cleaned up and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
an inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; thus , the scope of clinical data base for the evaluation of the vaccine is not made to comply with the requirements of the EMEA ( EMEA ) requirements . &quot;
&quot; if you want to participate in a clinical trial , please contact for further information about your treatment , please contact your treat@@ ise doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you want more information regarding the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , the Imm@@ une Def@@ iciency Syndrome ( HIV @-@ 1 ) caused the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for entry , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the safety of this combination was not investigated . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should then be re@@ arranged if the doctor has checked , which has taken an an@@ tivir@@ al medicines of the patient who has been judged , and the probability that the virus is approached at the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which together with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines . &quot;
&quot; for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is intended for body weight . &quot;
A@@ Gener@@ ase reduces the HIV @-@ quantity in blood in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines in blood and keeps them on a low level .
&quot; however , AIDS is not able to cure the immune system , thus allowing the development of HIV related infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was used in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; with low do@@ si@@ sted Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicines A@@ gener@@ ase was taken with 206 adults who had taken previously a prot@@ eas@@ ant inhibit@@ or , with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ demonstr@@ able concentrations of HIV in blood ( viral load ) or the change of viral load after treatment .
&quot; in the studies involving patients who had previously taken no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or had a viral load below 400 copies / ml than under placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the vir@@ us@@ load , but with children who had been treated earlier with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few on the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who had been treated earlier with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the viral load of A@@ gener@@ ase increased the vir@@ us@@ load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ eas@@ ant inhibit@@ or : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant against four other prot@@ eas@@ ant inhibit@@ or , it came to A@@ gener@@ ase a stronger waste of viral load after four weeks than in patients who continue their previous release inhibit@@ or : &quot;
&quot; A@@ Gener@@ ase ( diarr@@ hea ) , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ hea ) , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ hea ) , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , vomiting , skin rash and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ pr@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ om@@ avi@@ r or other components .
&quot; aspir@@ ase should also not be used in patients , the cur@@ bs ( a vegetable preparation for the treatment of depression ) or drugs which are known as A@@ cou@@ ase , and are harmful to high concentrations in blood health . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , the A@@ gener@@ ase are taking cancer , the risk of cy@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rop@@ hy ( alter@@ ations in the distribution of body fat ) , an oste@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( symptoms of an infection that caused by the immune system ) . &quot;
the Commission for Human@@ itarian Aid ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ cou@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is generally taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ es@@ thetic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with k@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously have had no prot@@ eas@@ ant inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; because of scientific reasons for scientific reasons only limited information . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited for placing A@@ gener@@ a in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; aspir@@ ase is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ eas@@ ant inhibit@@ or ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children aged 4 years . &quot;
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic boo@@ sting of am@@ om@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r should be carried out in taking into account of individual viral resistance and treatment of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r as a solution for entry is 14 % less than one capsule ; therefore A@@ Gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ Gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg . Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily together with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 If A@@ Gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the enh@@ ancing addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) must be applied for higher doses ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ Gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ ent@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of c@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not investigated in children . &quot;
&quot; aspir@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the error of data to the un@@ think@@ able and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ es@@ thetic data , the dose of A@@ cou@@ ase capsules in adult patients should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver disorders to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application should be used in patients with mild or moderate @-@ liver disease with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is counter @-@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width , and also sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal supplements containing the cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied due to the risk of reducing Plas@@ ma@@ stur@@ geon and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ om@@ avi@@ r during taking am@@ om@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should not be noted that A@@ Gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a healing of HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with A@@ cou@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transfer@@ ring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually A@@ Gener@@ ase capsules together with low doses of c@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs are to be applied ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients who are suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of liver disease in potentially fatal .
&quot; for the case of simultaneous an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of hepatitis B or C , please refer to the relevant information of this medicine . &quot;
patients with existing reduced liver function including a chron@@ ically active hepatitis show an increased incidence of liver function under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored in clinical practice .
&quot; the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ ason or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ ids , that will not be recommended unless the possible use of a treatment of systemic drug co@@ o@@ i@@ der effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the epi@@ ece function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin strongly depends on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , an simultaneous administration of A@@ cou@@ stic with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin were not recommended for increased risk of my@@ op@@ ia including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some drugs that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alisation ratio ) , methods are used to determine the effectiveness concentration . &quot;
&quot; for patients who use these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective due to dimin@@ ished plasma level of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic inter@@ actions with Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tive may be altered , but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of inter@@ actions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored at O@@ pi@@ at@@ essen symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the possible risk of tox@@ icity , due to the high prop@@ yl@@ ation content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ sted with children under an age of four years and should be used to be careful with certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; aspir@@ ase should be reduced to about 5 if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients who received a anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , was reported on the occurr@@ ence of diabetes mell@@ itus , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia or an existing diabetes mell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases to which therapy drugs were needed to be associated with the development of a diabetes mell@@ itus or hyper@@ glyc@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports about an increase of bleeding , including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ es . &quot;
&quot; at the time of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients may develop a inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ ist infections which leads to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi @-@ fact@@ orial e@@ ology is assumed ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe Body Mass Index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose , especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic lat@@ ency may not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ pr@@ avi@@ r must not be used together with drugs whose active ingredients are used primarily via CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are connected to the increased plasma level with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to an vi@@ rology failure and lead to a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in trying to balance the lowest plasma level by a dose of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with ri@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently un@@ wanted effects of the liver were observed . &quot;
Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ om@@ avi@@ r can be hum@@ bled by the simultaneous application of vegetable preparations ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient already occupies Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the am@@ ate@@ av@@ ir@@ amide mirror and , if possible to check the vir@@ us@@ load and add the cur@@ b we@@ eds . &quot;
a dose adjustment for one of the medicine is not necessary when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ noch below ) .
&quot; 508 % increase , for C@@ up to 30 % lower if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of Am@@ ent@@ avi@@ r were applied twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which prove the effectiveness and un@@ think@@ able of this therapy schem@@ atic . &quot;
52 % lower when Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r ( 750 m@@ g. twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were met with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of ca@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dos@@ ing recommendation for simultaneous administration of am@@ om@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is not recommended that the effectiveness and un@@ think@@ able this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ etic study in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but is recommended due to the ant@@ acid component of di@@ dan@@ o in combination that the income of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and aspir@@ in are at least one hour apart ( see ant@@ acids below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in combination of E@@ zi@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is not necessary . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ mot@@ ir@@ ence in combination with Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended because the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ant inhibit@@ or would become low .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pine on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or and existing limited data can be dis@@ cour@@ aged that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pine might gain the serum concentration of Am@@ gen@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if this medication should be used simultaneously , caution is advis@@ able because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din because of the dimin@@ ished and possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma level might be less effective . &quot;
&quot; when this medication is applied together , caution is advis@@ able ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be performed , as an exact forecast for the effect of the combination of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult to be done . &quot;
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ bei@@ ut@@ in led to a rise of plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ bei@@ ut@@ in by 193 % and thereby associated with Ri@@ bei@@ ut@@ in associated side effects .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ bei@@ ut@@ in combined with A@@ gener@@ ase , is to be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data occur . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ etic trials with ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin were not performed in combination with ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin , however , the plasma level of both medicines could be increased in case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ on@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole a daily basis to 2.@@ 69@@ meters compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole a day without the simultaneous application of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ ees with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be applied together with A@@ gener@@ ase , possibly inter@@ actions . &quot;
&quot; patients should therefore be used on toxic reactions , which are connected to these drugs , if they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , it is advis@@ able that Ant@@ azi@@ da could not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ asis . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of anti @-@ con@@ vul@@ va , known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r can lead to a reduced plasma level of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; serum concentration of calcium carbonate block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ di@@ pin , pine pin , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ b pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r , elimin@@ ates the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine . &quot;
the simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ion of A@@ cou@@ ase can increase their plasma concentration and increase associated side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ ers , vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily , with 50 µg of flu@@ ori@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ times daily ) , the Flu@@ tic@@ on@@ onic plasma level rose by about 86 % , while the endo@@ genous c@@ ort@@ is@@ ol increased by about 86 % ( 90 % con@@ flu@@ ency intervals 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with k@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ ids , unless the possible benefit of a treatment is the risk of systemic cancer risk ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , which depends heavily on the pl@@ anting of the plasma level in simultaneous administration of as@@ ep@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; since Plas@@ ma@@ im@@ ex controls of this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or to my@@ opathy , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of this medicine is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; there is a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations as far as stabili@@ zation of the mirror , since the plasma concentration of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can be increased at the same time ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase cannot be applied together with oral eng@@ ined Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while in simultaneous application of A@@ cou@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al ten@@ ol@@ am caution is advis@@ able . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate an possible increase of the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am for 3 to 4 @-@ feet .
&quot; if Meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored at O@@ pi@@ at@@ essen symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ ability , there is no recommendation to be given as the am@@ on@@ av@@ ir@@ - dose , if Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; for simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ um together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alisation ratio ) is recommended for the possibility of a reduction or rein@@ forcement of the anti @-@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tive is not pre@@ dict@@ able , therefore , are also recommended alternative methods of contra@@ c@@ eption . &quot;
&quot; careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants ( for example , Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for simultaneous production of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be applied only after careful extraction of the potential for the mother in comparison to the potential risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in milk l@@ ur@@ able rats , Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , however , it is not known whether Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r is over in breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , administered by the in@@ fest@@ ation in the u@@ terus to the end of the breast@@ feeding Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight during the after@@ no@@ bility . &quot;
the further development of re@@ funds including fermentation and reprodu@@ ci@@ bility was not imp@@ aired by the administration of Am@@ gen@@ avi@@ r to the parent .
the un@@ think@@ able of A@@ cou@@ ase was studied in adults and with children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; most of the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment associated side effects were slight to moderate , very early on and led rarely to treatment departure . &quot;
&quot; with many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether they are used in connection with taking A@@ cou@@ ase or any other at the same time used to the HIV treatment , or whether they are a sequence of cruel disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the listed side effects are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , who were employed by the exam@@ ines as in connection with the study medication , and in more than 1 % of patients , as well as the treatment of regulatory laboratory changes ( degree 3 @-@ 4 ) are listed as well . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rop@@ hy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of strong and persistent fat tissue , prolifer@@ ating and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ trop@@ hy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ zer@@ vi@@ k@@ al fat collection . &quot;
&quot; less than 113 - not previously treated persons , who were treated with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ in / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ in over a medium duration of 36 weeks , was only one case ( st@@ acking ) ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , with 245 N@@ RT@@ I@@ - treated patients under Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ RT@@ Is over a medium duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin deposits were usually slightly mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ atic or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and emerged during the second treatment week and disappeared within two weeks without the treatment with Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r had to be broken . &quot;
cases of oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose were reported in particular patients with generally known risk factors that advanced HIV @-@ disease or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
&quot; at the time of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients may develop a inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ cal opportun@@ ist infections ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre @-@ treated patients , the 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase were observed twice daily together with low do@@ si@@ sted Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( degree 3 and 4 ) , which were observed under all@@ u@@ ase treatment ( degree 3 and 4 ) , which were identified with low do@@ si@@ sted Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 3 and 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of an overdose , the patient is on signs of an in@@ tox@@ icity ( see section 4.8 ) , if necessary , are necessary supporting measures . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease , thereby preventing the process of viral g@@ ag@@ - and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ proteins forward with the result of a formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied in both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripher@@ al blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm at acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µm at chronic in@@ infected cells .
the connection between the activity of am@@ om@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not defined yet .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - such as other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r pr@@ oo@@ ster@@ ous treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ eas@@ ing inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations are rarely observed .
&quot; with sixteen doses of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients who received $ 700@@ mg of Fos@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure could be examined until week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ical analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children , in which a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure could not included within the 59 , with prot@@ eas@@ ant inhibit@@ ors , demonstrated resistance pattern which were similar to those with adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ V , M@@ 46@@ I / L , I@@ 47@@ V , I@@ 50@@ E , I@@ 50@@ E , I@@ 50@@ E , I@@ 50@@ E , I@@ 50@@ E , I@@ 50@@ E , I@@ 50@@ E , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V and I@@ 93@@ L / M . &quot;
&quot; in the study AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and their extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ r / 100 mg of Fos@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) , patients with cervical canc@@ ers occurred over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations : &quot;
&quot; on gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance test analysis , gen@@ otyp@@ ical inter@@ pret@@ ations systems can be applied to estimate the activity of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ eas@@ ant inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is defined as the presence of the mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , I@@ 8@@ 2A and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ aline with a reduced probability of a vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; conclusions regarding the relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations pattern can be subject to any additional data , and it is recommended to always attract the current inter@@ pret@@ ations systems for analysis of the results of resistance tests . &quot;
&quot; on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing , clin@@ ically vali@@ ant analysis systems can be applied in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ical data on the evaluation of activity of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ otyp@@ ical inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
companies to drive diagnostic resist@@ ence tests have developed clinical @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ off@@ s ( separ@@ ations ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be applied to the interpretation of an resist@@ ence tests .
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity against Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r associated genetic samples creates a certain cross@@ resistance against ri@@ ca@@ vi@@ r , the sensitivity against In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data available to cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ ees , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral patients treated to which a Fos@@ amp@@ er / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 Isol@@ ate ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 Isol@@ ate ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; the vice versa , Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ ant inhibit@@ or of isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early departure of a failed therapy is recommended to maintain the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in boundaries which can affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; the proof of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a randomised open study ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with an PI , mainly with the lowest k@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty patients ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ cou@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the research study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
&quot; the primary analysis presented the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI Group in terms of time @-@ adjusted average change of output ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ lying shaft of 0,4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
&quot; the proof of the efficacy of un@@ protected A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 with PI were treated . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution was administered twice daily , 20 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , and the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; it was not given a low do@@ omed ri@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ RT@@ Is previously . &quot;
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients included in the study included a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a median increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
19 Based on this data should be considered for the treatment optim@@ ising with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ed &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; after oral administration , the median duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increase , for C@@ maximum reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake affects the magn@@ itude and rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a weight of 70 kg ) and allows for a large distribution volume and an enormous penetration of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation in the tissue . &quot;
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of energy in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ om@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active share , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of non @-@ bound Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components of the free active ingredient in the ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , pharmac@@ euticals must in@@ duce or in@@ hib@@ ited the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution when they are given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ Gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ orti@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bi@@ over@@ se@@ eable than from the capsules , therefore A@@ gener@@ ase solution and aspir@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gramm@@ ation basis . &quot;
&quot; also the ren@@ al cle@@ aring of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of a ren@@ al function distur@@ bing the elim@@ ination of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment schem@@ ati@@ ata lead to Am@@ bul@@ b@@ r @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ ids comparable to those who are tied to healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r twice daily without the simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for the can@@ v@@ ogen@@ icity with am@@ om@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne Aden@@ ome ( rat ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of the exposure of people , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r , states . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the he@@ al cell carcin@@ ogen@@ es Aden@@ ome and Kar@@ zin@@ ome has not yet been resolved and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects are un@@ clear .
&quot; however , some evidence of clinical studies were used as well as from therapeutic procedures , however , little indications for the adoption of a clinical relev@@ ance of this findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ational tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ kern@@ test in rats and chromos@@ om@@ en@@ ab@@ err@@ ations test of human peripher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes was not mut@@ ed nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; these liver tox@@ icity can be monitored in clinical use of AST , AL@@ T , and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; previously , clinical trials have been observed no significant liver tox@@ icity in patients , neither during administration of A@@ gener@@ ase nor after the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies on tox@@ icity in young specimens were treated at a age of 4 days , both were treated as well as with the indicator @-@ animals as well as with Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r animals . &quot;
&quot; with systemic plasma exposure that was significantly higher ( rats ) or significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure of therapeutic dosage , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus@@ ong@@ ation and low @-@ level skel@@ etal changes were observed . &quot;
24 If A@@ Gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the enh@@ ancing addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) must be applied for higher doses ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ Gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ ent@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the simultaneous application should be used in patients with a weak or lighter liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is counter @-@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some drugs that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alisation ratio ) , methods are used to determine the effectiveness concentration . &quot;
&quot; aspir@@ ase should be set to over 27 if a skin rash is accompanied by systematic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an increased risk of li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rop@@ hy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to an vi@@ rology failure and lead to a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increase , for C@@ up to 30 % lower if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were met with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of ca@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dos@@ ing recommendation for simultaneous administration of am@@ om@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is not recommended that the effectiveness and un@@ think@@ able this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ mot@@ ir@@ ence in combination with Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended because the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ant inhibit@@ or would become low .
&quot; when this medication is applied together , caution is advis@@ able ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be performed , as an exact forecast for the effect of the combination of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult to be done . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ bei@@ ut@@ in combined with A@@ gener@@ ase , is to be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose 31 if there are no clinical data available . &quot;
&quot; serum concentration of calcium carbonate block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ di@@ pin , pine pin , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ b pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r , elimin@@ ates the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily , with 50 µg of flu@@ ori@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ times daily ) , the Flu@@ tic@@ on@@ onic plasma level rose by about 86 % , while the endo@@ genous c@@ ort@@ is@@ ol increased by about 86 % ( 90 % con@@ flu@@ ency intervals 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; for simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ um together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alisation ratio ) is recommended for the possibility of a reduction or rein@@ forcement of the anti @-@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of E@@ thin@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of No@@ re@@ thin@@ dron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r 22 % respectively .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be applied only after careful extraction of the potential for the mother in comparison to the potential risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , administered by the in@@ lay in the u@@ terus to the end of the breast@@ feeding Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in body weight during the after@@ no@@ bility . &quot;
the un@@ think@@ able of A@@ cou@@ ase was studied in adults and with children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in case of an overdose , the patient is on signs of an in@@ tox@@ icity ( see section 4.8 ) , if necessary , are necessary supporting measures . &quot;
&quot; the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied in both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripher@@ al blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm at acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µm at chronic infected cells ( 1 µm = 0.@@ 50 µg / ml ) .
&quot; the vice versa , Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ ant inhibit@@ or of isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , at the therapy optim@@ isation in with PI pre@@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ed &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase &quot; should be considered . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of non @-@ bound Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredient in the ste@@ ady state during the ste@@ ady state in the ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; therefore , pharmac@@ euticals must in@@ duce or in@@ hib@@ ited the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution when they are given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
also the ren@@ al cle@@ aring of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negle@@ cted ; therefore the effect of a ren@@ al function distur@@ bing the elim@@ ination of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .

the underlying mechanism for the emergence of the he@@ aters o@@ zel@@ ul@@ ary Aden@@ ome and Kar@@ zin@@ ome has not yet been resolved and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects are un@@ clear .
&quot; however , some evidence of clinical studies were found out of the present exposure data as well as from therapeutic use , however , some hints for the adoption of a clinical relev@@ ance of this findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ational tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ kern@@ test in rats and chromos@@ om@@ en@@ ab@@ err@@ ations test of human peripher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes was not mut@@ ed nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; studies on tox@@ icity in young specimens were treated at a age of 4 days , both were treated as well as with the indicator @-@ animals as well as with Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r animals . &quot;
&quot; these results suggest that in young the metabol@@ ites are not yet mature , am@@ om@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) are not fully equipped . &quot;

&quot; the benefits of with &quot; &quot; oo@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution &quot; &quot; has not been treated with PI previously untreated patients with PI . &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r as a solution for entry is 14 % less than one capsule ; therefore A@@ Gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; patients should be able to swal@@ low the capsules , as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the use of the solution ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ Gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r / kg of body@@ weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2800 mg Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , since there is no dose recommended for simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take and low do@@ si@@ sted Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided , this combination with these patient groups can be avoided . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adap@@ table for Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r is not necessary , a application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution is counter @-@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ yl@@ ation content is A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take children and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with restricted liver function or liver failure , and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration can lead to a competent inhibit@@ ing of this drug and possibly cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhyth@@ ms ( z .
patients should not be noted that A@@ Gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a healing of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .

&quot; the applic@@ ability and duration of treatment with al@@ dar@@ a depend on the treatment of treat@@ able disease : • In case of incl@@ ines within the genital area , Al@@ dar@@ a is twice a week for six weeks . • In case of one or two four weeks of treatment , it is open three weeks between the treatment cycles , three times a week . &quot;
the cream is dil@@ uted before bed@@ time on the affected skin surfaces so that it remains sufficient for a long time ( about eight hours ) on the skin before she is washed away .
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared to placebo ( the same cream but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ nings in the genital area for 16 weeks . &quot;
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete separation of treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also treated in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma in two studies in which patients were treated for six weeks or placebo either daily or five times a week .

&quot; an interru@@ ption in the treatment process should be weighed , if intensive local inflammation occur ( see section 4.4 ) or when the treatment area is observed . &quot;
&quot; if follow @-@ up examinations for 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , les@@ ions are only incomplete , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;

&quot; with an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in higher than the recommended doses , increased risk of severe skin irrit@@ ation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations have been observed , which needed a treatment necessary and / or to a temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the outcome of the ure@@ th@@ ra , some women had difficulties with water , which needed a emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of affected area . &quot;

&quot; treatment of the bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips or hair loss was not investigated . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions take effect in general during therapy , or reactions form after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary due to the symptoms of the patient , or due to the sever@@ ity of the local skin reaction , a treatment for several days can be done . &quot;
the clinical outcome of therapy may be judged after the treatment of treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .

&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated B@@ CC@@ s are no clinical experiences , therefore the application is not recommended with previously untreated tum@@ ours . &quot;
data from an open clinical study indicate that during large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a smaller probability of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy exists .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has not been investigated for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ eries on eyel@@ ids . inside the nose or ears or on the lip@@ stick within the lip@@ stick .
there are only very limited data on the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses on anatom@@ ic places outside the facial and the scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data via the ac@@ tin@@ ic not@@ ch on arms and hands do not support the effectiveness in this application . therefore , such an application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions usually take away in the course of therapy to intensity or go back after the treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin reaction may cause large un@@ eas@@ iness or very strong , treatment can be suspended for several days . &quot;
&quot; out of the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 battery les@@ ions showed a lower complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune stimul@@ ating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creme should be applied to patients who receive an immune supp@@ ression treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies do not have direct or indirect adverse effects on the pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / f@@ öt@@ ale development , which indicate the integration or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither after one time , the quanti@@ fiable time ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) quanti@@ fiable time ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) can be reached , no recommendation can be given during the breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the most frequently allocated and probably probably with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream related side effects in the studies with three weeks of treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of ti@@ lt ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients ) .
the most frequently reported and probably probably with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream related side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
&quot; the Bas@@ ali@@ om patients treated by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Creme from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III , reported adverse reactions . &quot;
&quot; the most frequent , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Creme in the context of this studies were reaction to the application of application ( 22 % of patients with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients ) . &quot;
&quot; adverse events that were given by 252 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials involving I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream patients with acute ker@@ at@@ ose , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; the investig@@ ative assessment of clinical signs revealed that a clinical study involving I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream frequently demonstrated to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , ec@@ ori@@ ation / de@@ pl@@ ating ( 23 % ) and oil ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the investig@@ ative assessment of clinical signs , the investig@@ ational evaluation of clinical evidence shows that these studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream very frequently used to severe ery@@ areas ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sion ( 13 % ) , and too heavy fighting education ( 19 % ) . &quot;
clinical trials investig@@ ating the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment of treatment or in the surrounding area .
&quot; the acci@@ dental admission of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vomiting , headache , my@@ al@@ gies and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , was norm@@ alized in hyp@@ ot@@ onia that norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous liquid . &quot;
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ etic examination after the top@@ ical use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od increased systemic concentrations of the alpha @-@ interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ to@@ k@@ ine .
&quot; in 3 appro@@ vals Phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy studies could be shown that the effectiveness in respect to a complete allocation of f@@ eig@@ ns during an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment is superior to a placebo treatment over 16 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in a total of 60 % of patients with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ treated patients healing the incl@@ ines completely , this was 20 % of the 105 patients treated with placebo in@@ treated patients ( 95 % CI : &quot;
&quot; a full allocation could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared with 5 % of placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI : &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od during the five @-@ term application a week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically , single primary cell carcin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm . &quot;
&quot; the data from an open , un@@ controlled long@@ term study after four years of this data show that about 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically treated for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od during three weeks of use in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ controlled clinical trials was investigated . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , discre@@ et , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic accent , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic files within a connected 25 c@@ m2 large treatment area than on the un@@ hair@@ y scal@@ p or on the face . &quot;
the annual follow @-@ up data from two combined monitoring studies show a recur@@ ren@@ al rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical analysis .
the approved indications of external f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ons , Akt@@ ì ker@@ at@@ osis and Super@@ fi@@ zi@@ elles bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma occurs in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients usually not on and were therefore not investigated . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was studied in four randomised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum Cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 313 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the doses of doses ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) .
&quot; a minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème with the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the highest medicine concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and tot@@ aled 0.1 , 0,2 and 1,6 ng / ml with the application in the face ( 12.5 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated half @-@ life period was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ value after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; that indicates an extended re@@ ten@@ tion of the medicine in the skin .
&quot; data on the systemic exposure showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od of patients at the age of 6 @-@ 12 years was low and comparable to patients with healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ osis or super @-@ target bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ month study to der@@ mal tox@@ icity at the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG lead to significantly reduced body@@ weight and elevated Mil@@ z weight ; for another four months , the study found no similar effects in the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study for carcin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice at the oral administration at three days a week induced no tum@@ ors at the application point .
&quot; the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od only has a minor systemic absorption from the human skin , and not mut@@ agen@@ ic , is a risk of people looking very low due to systemic exposure . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ors occurred in mice , which was treated with real @-@ free cream , formerly and in larger numbers than in the control group with lower U@@ VR . &quot;

&quot; in the study , mainly the safety of the drug was investigated , however , it was also measured its effectiveness ( by exam@@ ining its effect regarding the reduction of G@@ ag concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under five years of sen@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , G@@ ag concentrations in the Ur@@ in rose by about 60 % , and half of the treated children pointed at the end of the study a normal large liver . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , arth@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia , pain in the lim@@ bs ( in hands and feet ) , heat este@@ em , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion point . &quot;
&quot; very frequent side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be sensitive to patients who may react strongly to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) , cannot be applied . &quot;
&quot; each year the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will be updated every year , which may be known , testing and updating this summary . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who observe Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , regarding reactions to in@@ fusion and development of antibodies . &quot;
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. for placing Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union . &quot;

&quot; treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor , the experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases . &quot;
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased , if the patient is wearing this , all 15 minutes in single steps are increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suffici@@ ency was not determined and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
&quot; patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which are defined as any correlation in connection , which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to monitor close mes@@ m@@ asch@@ ig , and in@@ fusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made in an appropriate clinical study where re @-@ revi@@ ving facilities are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , almost all patients Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are usually expected in 3 months from the start of treatment . &quot;
&quot; patients , the antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution with caution ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; as little experience regarding the recovery of treatment after a longer interru@@ ption , it must be careful because of the theoretical increased risk reaction after a interru@@ ption of treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or Anti@@ py@@ ran@@ ka ) to minim@@ ize the potential of in@@ fusion reactions .
&quot; in case of a slight or medium in@@ fusion reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weighed and / or a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to half the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of individual , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are decreasing , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is weak@@ ened . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be resumed with a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
&quot; 3 ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) , as well as a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of in@@ fusion rate , which occurred in the previous reaction . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ quin or pro@@ c@@ ain , because a potential risk of interference with intra@@ cellular recording of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase exists . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no data in new@@ bor@@ ns that were exp@@ on@@ ated across lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended , while the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is not too breast@@ feeding . &quot;
&quot; adverse reactions were in@@ jected mainly as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) were observed . &quot;
&quot; un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma , who were observed during the phase @-@ 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older in a total treatment duration : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respiratory tra@@ cts and lungs in the history , severe reactions came out in addition to bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus , respiratory problems and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma , who were reported in a phase 2 study involving 20 patients with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , reported in the table , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients it came within 3 months after the onset of treatment with a ser@@ oc@@ onic version , most of the patients at the age of 5 with a severe deteri@@ oration @-@ form usually came to a ser@@ oc@@ onic version ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; by the end of the Phase 3 study ( or to an early departure from the study ) , in 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) Ass@@ ay det@@ ectable antibodies ( R@@ IP ) Ass@@ ay , including 3 patients , where it was never too ser@@ oc@@ onic version . &quot;
patients with a short@@ age of low antibodies had a robust reduction in G@@ ag @-@ mirror in the Har@@ n during patients with high antibodies tit@@ res a variable reduction of G@@ ag in Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal up to low neutr@@ alizing industry effect on enzy@@ matic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro which seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ ag in Har@@ n .
the presence of anti @-@ physical medication seemed to be found in connection with the incidence of adverse drug reactions when the occurr@@ ence of un@@ wanted drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the ration@@ ale for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hy@@ d@@ roly@@ sis of the acute sub@@ str@@ ats and preventing a further accumulation of sufficient recovery .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ i @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were investigated in a randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recruited for the study , the entire disease spectrum was applied , the majority of the patients had the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
&quot; patients were recruited when they had an ongoing exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters . &quot;
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
&quot; all patients were then recruited for an open @-@ label extension study , where it received 100 E / kg of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) . &quot;
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients to improve lung function and in@@ ability to be shown in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in an open extension study , an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as the following table emerg@@ es . &quot;
the decline of the percentage of FE@@ V is not significantly higher than the period of clin@@ ically significant and absolute lung @-@ volumes increased further to the body @-@ size of growing children .
out of the 26 patients with a hepat@@ ocy@@ ry before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study a normal liver size .
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a clear end of the g@@ ag mirror in Har@@ n ( µg / mg of Kre@@ at@@ inin ) was established , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; regarding the hetero@@ gen@@ eous disease manifest@@ ation between the patients who has been taken into account , clin@@ ically significant changes for five efficacy variable ( at least 20 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) , and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) was observed . &quot;
a one @-@ year @-@ old open phase 2 study was performed in which primarily the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients who were at the time of their recording in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with the heavy tra@@ der form and 4 ) .
in four patients the dosage due to increased G@@ AG@@ - mirrors in the Har@@ n in week 22 increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients a size increase ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was diagnosed according to the Z Score for this age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the medium speed form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the medium speed form is only limited or no progress in cogn@@ itive development .
&quot; in a phase 4 study , studies were carried out on the G@@ ag mirror in Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dos@@ ing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be found in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , a representative alternative ; however , it is not demonstrated that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dos@@ ing schem@@ ati@@ ata is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will be updated every new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ etic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to elderly and less affected patients .

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ( another drug against cancer ) in patients , who have not yet been removed ( medicines for cancer ) , and is likely to be removed up to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small cell lung cancer , which doesn &apos;t attack the epi@@ thel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have previously untreated , in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in and in patients who have previously used other chemotherapy regim@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should intake cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as folic acid ( vitamin C ) and folic acid in the treatment of vitamin B12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ plat@@ in in addition an &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um &quot; ( medicines for vomiting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) . &quot;
&quot; patients whose blood image changes , or any other side effects may occur , the treatment should be broken up , removed or reduces the dose . &quot;
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells share .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in its active form is lighter than in healthy cells than in healthy cells which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer work time in cancer cells .
&quot; for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ end@@ othel@@ ial cells , A@@ lim@@ ta was studied in a major study of 456 patients who had previously received chemotherapy for their disease previously . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were treated in a study on 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously untreated with the effects of Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) . &quot;
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another drug against cancer ) and both in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.3 months compared to the sole administration of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
&quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy first , the average survival rate was with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months , compared to 7.9 months at Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients in which cancer did not attack the epi@@ thel@@ ium cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta long lifetime than with the compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted Eli Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. a approval for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; each throughput bottle must be replaced with 4.2 ml 0,9 % sodium chloride solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
&quot; the corresponding package of the necessary Do@@ - is taken from the de@@ structive bottle , and dil@@ uted with 0,9 % sodium chloride solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml . ( see section 6.6 ) . &quot;
AL@@ IM@@ TA is in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in displayed on first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ cell lung carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approx . 30 minutes after completion of P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion the first day every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small @-@ cell lung carcin@@ oma , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle . &quot;
reducing the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions must be given the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed gift as well as the day after treatment a cor@@ tical ster@@ oid .
&quot; during the seven days prior to the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of folic acid are taken and the intake must be continued during the entire treatment period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ - dose . &quot;
patients also need to receive in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose and after each third stop cycle .
&quot; in patients suffering from p@@ em@@ etry , a complete blood image should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of leuk@@ ocy@@ tes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) , and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination will take place under the Al@@ adi@@ rs of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the previous treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; according to recovery , patients must be treated according to the references in tables 1 , 2 and 3 to apply for AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy , or in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( CT@@ C v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ CT@@ C degrees 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ degree of 3 ( excluding neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) and the patient must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA .
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA has to be canc@@ eled if patients after 2 dose reductions or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - on the occurr@@ ence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies showed no indication of patients at the age of 65 on the age of 65 . compared to patients at the age of 65 years an elevated by @-@ impact risk .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data for un@@ question@@ able and effectiveness .
clinical trials were necessary for patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min . no dose adjustments are necessary to assume the recommended dose adjustments for all patients .
the data base in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin Clear@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver restriction of &gt; 1.5 @-@ fold of the top b@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; with the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( with presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies . &quot;
patients have to be supervised with regard to the Kno@@ b@@ ular supp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must not be administered to patients before their absolute neutr@@ rop@@ enia is a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ tes reaches a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; a dose reduction for further cycles is based on N@@ adir &apos;s absolute neutral number , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles . ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 ug@@ mat@@ ological and non @-@ psychological tox@@ icity , such as neut@@ rop@@ enia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neutr@@ rop@@ enia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ enia , when a pre@@ treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed patients have to be used to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophe@@ tic measure to reduce waste of tox@@ icity ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ logi@@ st@@ ika ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ eic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and minim@@ ising ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
all patients who are intended for therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half @-@ term therapy for at least 5 days prior to therapy and for at least 2 days after therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; many patients suffering from these events , corresponding risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation required in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the eff@@ el must be weighed before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment . &quot;
&quot; 5 serious cardiovascular events , including M@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , and cereb@@ ral spec@@ ular events were often reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ dly occasionally when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ed life di@@ mm@@ ers ( except yellow fever , this in@@ oc@@ ulation is contra@@ dict@@ ated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible shafts that consists of reproductive @-@ ability due to p@@ em@@ etry , men should be pointed out before treatment - to take advice on the sperm cells . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ logi@@ st@@ ika ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g per day ) can result in a dimin@@ ished P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed @-@ loss of adverse events . &quot;
therefore caution is advis@@ able when patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - spent 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ etry ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data regarding the Inter@@ tionary potenti@@ als with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s are available with a long half @-@ life time like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - mixed . &quot;
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of smell status during the illness and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ y chemotherapy requires a increased surveillance frequency of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alisation ) when the decision was taken to treat the patient du@@ cks with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ um .
&quot; there are no data for using P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed at pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - r@@ ene an@@ tim@@ et@@ abol@@ ites are expected to be severe defects in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; p@@ em@@ etry may not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessary , demanding , and after careful extraction of the usage for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage of reproductive conduc@@ tivity , men should be pointed out before the course of the treatment , advice regarding the sperm accounts . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ tos over@@ comes into the mother &apos;s milk , and un@@ wanted effects of infants can &apos;t be excluded . &quot;
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity adverse effects that were reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with Mes@@ othel@@ i@@ om and random@@ ized C@@ is@@ plat@@ in and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed and 163 patients with Mes@@ othel@@ i@@ om that received random@@ ized C@@ is@@ plat@@ in as mon@@ otherapy .

the primary analysis of this study was undertaken in the population of all patients who were random@@ ized and treated in treatment arms ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
statistically significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ om was shown in the application of the Lun@@ ches @-@ causing cancer in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole C@@ is@@ pla@@ - tin @-@ arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between both treatment arms are caused by an improvement of lung @-@ function parameters in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function in the time of control .

&quot; in a third study , all@@ i was compared with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who generate all@@ i 60 mg , after a year recorded an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg in the in@@ gest@@ ion of placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study of all@@ i with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , patients could not be observed for the patient &apos;s relevant weight loss . &quot;

&quot; patients , all@@ i and medicines for hyper@@ tension , or increased cholesterol levels , should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ists , whether the dosage must be adjusted to this medicine . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to meet additional fluctu@@ ating measures , in order to prevent severe diarr@@ ho@@ ea possible to prevent oral contra@@ cep@@ tions ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
both in a study on inter@@ actions of medicines as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed a lowering of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma screens .

&quot; or@@ list@@ at side effects are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal nature , and hang up with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of drow@@ sin@@ ess fat is prevented . &quot;
gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally easy and temporary .
&quot; the Frequ@@ encies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , seldom ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( frequency on the basis of available data is not estimated to be estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of the known adverse events that were detected after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known , since these events have been voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain size . &quot;
&quot; † It is pl@@ au@@ sible , that treatment with all@@ i can result in terms of possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects . &quot;
&quot; single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple sockets of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days of normal and overweight subjects , without significant clinical findings . &quot;
&quot; during the majority of the reported cases reported by or@@ list@@ at overdose , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on investigations on humans and animal , from a fast re@@ formation of systemic effects , which are due to the li@@ pas@@ cal properties of or@@ list@@ at , are assumed . &quot;

&quot; the primary parameter , the change in weight compared to the output value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in the course of course in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as part of the study participants that have lost more than 5 % of its initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction was observed for 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;

&quot; the most common adverse events are associated with the effect of the capsules , resulting in excess of fat from the body . &quot;
&quot; normally , these side effects occur during the first weeks after the start of treatment , as you have not yet reduced its fat percentage in the diet . &quot;
&quot; you can learn more about the usual fatty content with the following basic rules : • Beg@@ in already a few days , or better a week before the first intake of capsules with a fet@@ al diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite food and over the size of portions that you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood makes you exceed your fat limit . • Distri@@ bute your recommended fatty amount to the daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal , not to take it in the form of a low @-@ rich main court or a ste@@ ady night vision , as you may occur in other programs for weight loss . • Most people with those who appear to be able to control them with the time by adjust@@ ing their nutrition . &quot;
&quot; • Do not apply to medicine for children . • Do not apply all@@ i to the specified exp@@ ir@@ ation date . • The containers should keep well closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with Si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel , which serve to keep the capsules dry . &quot;

overweight has influence on your health and increases the risk of emergence of various serious diseases such as : • hyper@@ tension • diabetes - cancer disease • stroke canc@@ ers • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis - Please contact your doctor about your risk for this disease .
&quot; a permanent weight loss , for example through improving the diet and more movement , can prevent the removal of serious diseases and has a positive influence on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and learn after and gradually feed healthy . &quot;
energy is also measured in Kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les which also gives you as indication on the packaging of food . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take a maximum of each day .
note the following tables in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
&quot; what quantity is suitable for you , take the bottom of the information provided by the number of calories that is suitable for you . • Because of the mode of mode , the compliance of the capsule is crucial . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as far as before , it can mean that your body cannot process this quantity of fat . &quot;
&quot; by adher@@ ence to the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ize weight loss and dimin@@ ished the li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood for nutrition @-@ related accompanying symptoms . • You should try to gradually increase . &quot;
&quot; 34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should enable you to gradually lose weight , and lose about 0,5 kg per week , without fru@@ strations and dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; &quot; physical activity &quot; &quot; means that you can only do little or not go , stairs in the garden or other physical activities . • &quot; &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; &quot; means that you can walk daily 150 kcal per day , e.g. through 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 minutes of garden work or 2 km walk in 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; • For permanent weight loss , it is necessary to set up realistic cal@@ ori@@ en- and fat targets and keep it meaningful . • T@@ ry to move more to the cal@@ ori@@ de and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the all@@ i program for support the weight loss combine the capsules with a food plan and a large number of additional information materials that can help you to feed @-@ ori@@ de and fet@@ al processes , physically active . &quot;

&quot; Alo@@ xi is used by chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong trig@@ gers for nausea and vomiting ( like C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ) , and for chem@@ otherap@@ ies that are moderate trig@@ gers for nausea and vomiting ( like cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um ) .
&quot; the application for patients under 18 years is not recommended , since the effects in this age group is not enough information . &quot;
&quot; this means that the active ingredient prevent binding on a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ onin ) to recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies on 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ otherap@@ ies which are strong or moderate trig@@ gers for nausea and vomiting .
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , a strong trigger for nausea and vomiting , showed 59 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi in the 24 hours after chemotherapy not vomiting ( 132 from 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron patients ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , moderate trig@@ gers for nausea and vomiting , showed 81 % of patients who have been treated with Alo@@ xi in 24 hours after chemotherapy alone ( 153 of 189 ) , compared with 69 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron patients ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
&quot; compared with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values are 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission granted Helsin@@ n Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a approval for placing Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly em@@ eto@@ ing chemotherapy due to a cancer illness and for prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderate chemotherapy due to a cancer illness .
&quot; the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nausea and vomiting , induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be strengthened by adding a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids due to chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the colo@@ rec@@ tal cancer , patients should be monitored by an@@ am@@ id@@ ical Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us based injection . &quot;
&quot; as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , caution is offered at the same gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T@@ - interval is length@@ ening or that tend to be an extension . &quot;
&quot; except in connection with a further chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics , Alo@@ xi should neither be used to prevent nausea and vomiting for the treatment of nausea and vomiting . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron does not contain tum@@ ours of the five chem@@ otherap@@ eutic agents ( C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ak , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ etic interaction between one @-@ one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ static concentration of Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in a population based on a population , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ ine analysis was shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( D@@ exam@@ ines and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , hem@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , chin@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , cre@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ser@@ en@@ alin and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the cle@@ aring of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; on the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied for pregnant women , unless it is considered necessary by the treat@@ ise doctor . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ gram observed adverse events ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which stood at least possibly with Alo@@ xi , headache ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity reactions and reactions at the appointments ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dose , similar situations showed similar situations of undes@@ ired events such as in other dos@@ ages groups ; there were no dose of action relations to observe . &quot;
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , however , due to large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy at a Alo@@ xi@@ - su@@ do@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in two randomised double @-@ blin@@ d@@ studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients were obtained in total of 1,@@ 132 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ value 7.3 hours ) received intraven@@ ously to day 1 without D@@ exam@@ eth@@ ason intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; in a randomised double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pall@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron received patients who were 32 mg of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron were given to day 1 . &quot;
results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strong non @-@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
&quot; clinical trials for investig@@ ating chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of pall@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ T@@ c interval , including the corresponding effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; according to the findings of clinical trials , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block de@@ duction and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular channels and extend the duration of action . &quot;
the assessment of the study carried out by 221 healthy volunteers were the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of I.@@ V. mal@@ onic pall@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses ranging from 0.@@ 25 to 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous gift follows an initial acceptance of plasma concentration to an initial elim@@ ination of the body with an average season half @-@ value of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally used in the overall dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 m / kg with clients and cancer patients .
&quot; after an intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses was measured at 11 Ho@@ c cancer patients between day 1 and day 5 measured medium ( ± SD ) increase of pall@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ etic Sim@@ ulations , a daily intraven@@ ous injection of 0.@@ 25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days reached total exposure ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) , which was measured after a single intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ maximum was 0,@@ 75 mg . &quot;
&quot; approximately 40 % are eliminated over the kidneys , and approximately another 50 % are converted into two primary metabolism , which are compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron more than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor . &quot;
in @-@ vitro studies for metabol@@ ites have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 has been involved in the metabol@@ ism of pall@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
&quot; elim@@ ination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ in@@ ject , the total body weight of 173 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al cle@@ aring 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although , in patients with severe liver function , the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al is increased and the average systemic exposure of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron is increased , but a reduction of the dose is not justified by this . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions that are considered adequate via the maximum human therapeutic exposure which points to a low relev@@ ance for clinical use . &quot;
10 out of pre @-@ clinical studies indicate that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block at very high concentrations of ion channels that can be involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular De@@ - und Rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation and can extend the promotional period .
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( every dose ent@@ an@@ gled in about the 30 @-@ fold of therapeutic exposure when people ) , which were given every day over two years , led to a prolifer@@ ation of liver tum@@ ours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ op@@ las@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , pan@@ ni@@ as , cre@@ ni@@ er@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ours with rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not completely unknown , but due to the used high doses and because Alo@@ xi is intended for one @-@ time application , the relev@@ ance of these results will be small as for humans . &quot;
&quot; the approval of this auth@@ orization , the European Commission must inform the plans for the administration of this decision in the framework of this decision . &quot;

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Human@@ itarian Aid ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the approval of the approval of the treatment for the treatment of hepatitis C for the treatment of Alp@@ he@@ on 6 million IE / ml injection solution was recommended . &quot;
&quot; this means that Alp@@ he@@ on is a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same as an effective component , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference dent@@ ist &quot; ) . &quot;
Alp@@ he@@ on should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ treated ) hepatitis C ( one caused by viral infection ) .
&quot; in case of a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic study , the liver tissue damage caused damage , and the values of the liver enzyme Al@@ an@@ in Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast , into which a gene ( DNA ) was applied to the formation of the drug . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Alp@@ he@@ on presented data presented by Alp@@ he@@ on with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of efficiency , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Alp@@ he@@ on was compared with the effectiveness of reference procedure using 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
the study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment of the treatment to the medicine ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .

&quot; in addition , concerns have been expressed in regard to the stability of the drug and the marketing of the drug . &quot;
the number of patients with hepatitis C associated with Alp@@ he@@ on and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A were similar in clinical study .
&quot; after setting the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on flame ret@@ ard@@ ant the disease in more patients than at the reference dent@@ ist ; in addition , Alp@@ he@@ on had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , in the study , the test received a immune response ( i.e. the body makes antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
it can be used for the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with cr@@ ushing degree of skin infection ) and small in@@ infected Laz@@ ar@@ ations ( ar@@ c or chi@@ pping ) to meet needs and se@@ wn wounds .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go is not to be used for the treatment of infections , which have been proven to detect or presumably due to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) , because Alar@@ go is not affected against this type of infections . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from age nine months , but patients under the age of 18 may not be more than 2 % of body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient is not speaking after two to three days , the doctor should further investigate the patient and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of bacterial infections in which proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator of the efficacy was carried out in all five studies in the proportion of patients whose infection was withdrawn after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients suffering from placebo said to the treatment .
&quot; for the treatment of infected skin dogs , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together for skin dogs , about 90 % of both groups spoke on treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go was found in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( bott@@ led cav@@ ities in body tissue ) or of infections which have been proven to have been proven by M@@ RSA , not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation of the contract .
&quot; the Human@@ ist Committee &apos;s Committee ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits from Al@@ tar@@ go on the short @-@ time treatment of the following superf@@ icial skin infections are above the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected little la@@ under@@ ations , feeding or paraly@@ sed wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a approval for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; patients where there is no improvement in two to three days , should be examined once more and an alternative therapy is considered ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of a sensiti@@ zation or serious local irrit@@ ation , the treatment of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should be broken out , the treatment should be carefully wi@@ ped and an adequate alternative therapy of infection . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be applied to the treatment of infections where M@@ RSA is known as path@@ ogen or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
clinical trials in secondary trials was the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections that caused by a meth@@ ic@@ illin @-@ resistant stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) .
&quot; an alternative therapy is considered to be considered , if after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment there is no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected area . &quot;
the effects of simultaneous application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means of the same skin surface is not investigated and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicine is not recommended .
&quot; due to its low plasma concentrations , which have been reached by people after top@@ ical use on the skin , or infected superf@@ icial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant inhibit@@ or in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 After the same oral gift of 2 times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the medium ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be increased by 81 % on the rough skin of healthy adult men . &quot;
&quot; due to the low system exposure to top@@ ical use in patients , dos@@ ages are not required for required if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin are applied during a systematic therapy with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproduction x@@ icity according to oral in@@ gest@@ ion and are in@@ adequate in relation to impact on the birth and the f@@ öt@@ ale / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
&quot; ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy when a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clear , and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of a systemic antibiot@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in the decision whether the breast@@ feeding continued / terminated or terminated in the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go , it is between the benefit of the st@@ icking and the benefit of the stal@@ ac@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials involving 2,@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections which Al@@ tar@@ go was applied , the most frequently reported side effect of irrit@@ ation at the administration site which concerned about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; mode of mode ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated through fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the action mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein sy@@ thesis based on a specific bin@@ dings of the 50s sub @-@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ oma which diff@@ ers from the bin@@ ds of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the Bin@@ ocular Protein L@@ 3 is involved and in the region of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ Bin@@ ding Office and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ring Centre .
&quot; through Bin@@ d on this binding interface , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line transfer the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer , block partially P @-@ bin@@ ds inter@@ actions and prevent the normal education of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ aler sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the local prevalence of resistance , the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should appear at least some infection form , should be targeted by experts . &quot;
&quot; no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin were detected against S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ illin . &quot;
&quot; in case of non @-@ appe@@ aling to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes should be considered with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) . &quot;
&quot; Res@@ or@@ ption In a study of healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be was applied daily at oc@@ clu@@ sion and on the skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , which received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days to the top@@ ical treatment of secondary in@@ infected wounds , single plasma samples were extracted . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between a and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of an existing vaccine schedule when a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and is ensured that it can be led out of two cans of existing vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; ambient temperature , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis A@@ - or -@@ B vaccine will be given . if a r@@ ying dose is required for hepatitis A or B . &quot;
&quot; vacc@@ ines work by adding the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , &quot; as it can defend itself against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child received the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the viruses and surface anti@@ gens than &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components such as the approved vaccine Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults and the V@@ rix children &apos;s approved vaccine since 1997 .
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are applied to the protection against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults and Twin@@ rix are administered as part of an existing vaccine schedule . &quot;
&quot; because ambient rix and Twin@@ rix are identical identical ingredients , some of the data , which are used by the application of Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults , also used as proof for the application of ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective anti @-@ body concentration one month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of vaccine has been compared to a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two injec@@ tions . &quot;
ambient temperature resulted in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection for development and development of antibodies against Hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of ambient temperature of ambi@@ rix was in a sixth and a 12 @-@ month distance between injec@@ tions .
&quot; ambient temperature of ambi@@ ence ( observed during more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ines ) are headache , lack of pain , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ s ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix may not react with patients who may react sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) to the active ingredients that react to the other components or Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) .
&quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals . a. , a approval for the transport of Ambi@@ rix in the entire &quot;
&quot; the standard di@@ mm@@ ing plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ ing with ambient temperature consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a request is requested for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B , vacc@@ inated vacc@@ ines may be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ant vacc@@ ines or combination . &quot;
&quot; the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ H@@ bs@@ A@@ g ) Anti @-@ Hepatitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ bs@@ A@@ g ) , anti @-@ Hepatitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ bs@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ Hepatitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ bs@@ A@@ g ) antibodies are in the same size as the vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; it is not fully secured whether immune competent people , which are addressed to a hepatitis A@@ - vaccination , as they may also need protection as protection as they may also be protected by immune memory as well . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all injec@@ tions , the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction should be available immediately according to the gift of the vaccine for medical treatment and monitoring . &quot;
&quot; if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standard di@@ mm@@ ing scheme is recommended that the 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface . &quot;
&quot; in case of hem@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with dis@@ ru@@ ptions in the immune system , no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS @-@ antibodies are achieved , so that in these cases the gift of additional vacc@@ ines may be required . &quot;
&quot; as an intra@@ ocular injection , in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration in the glut@@ e@@ tically , could lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ etus , this injec@@ tions should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; in case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or blood cl@@ auses , Ambi@@ rix can be in@@ jected completely sub@@ cut@@ aneous , as it can occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift to bleeding . &quot;
&quot; if ambient temperature was administered in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with a combined diver@@ ge , tetra@@ he@@ el , az@@ ell@@ ul@@ um per@@ t@@ uss@@ - , in@@ activated Poli@@ omyel@@ itis and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us ass@@ enz@@ ae type b @-@ vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) , or with a combined mas@@ ern@@ - Mum@@ my m@@ öt@@ t@@ ine vaccine , was the immune response to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
patients with immun@@ os@@ res@@ sive therapy or patients with immune defects have to be assumed that perhaps no sufficient immune response is achieved .
&quot; clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults was the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ology , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , headache , and fever comparable with the frequency that was observed in the earlier thi@@ omer@@ isation and preserv@@ ative agent @-@ containing vaccine . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years , ambient mobility of ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ cans combination tool . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequency responses of pain and mat@@ ology at a calculation basis per vaccination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the test , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % of the test , compared to the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ doses combination . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vaccination cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects were given to the Ambi@@ rix , over pain , compared with 6@@ 3.8 % of the subjects , which have been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ Dos@@ age combination . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of Matcha was comparable high ( i.e. over the entire vaccination cycle at 3@@ 9.6 % of the subjects , the Ambi@@ rix were compared with 3@@ 6.2 % of the subjects who received the 3 @-@ doses combination ) . &quot;
the frequency of distinctive pain and relev@@ ance was low and comparable to the combination of the combination of combination with the 3 @-@ cans in@@ oc@@ sch@@ ema .
&quot; in a compar@@ ative study at 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vaccine , the occurr@@ ence of local reactions and general actions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group comparable to that with the 3 @-@ cans combination @-@ activated Hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was observed . &quot;
&quot; however , in the 6- to 11@@ - year old , however , after vaccination with ambi@@ ence , a common occurr@@ ence of pain ( on the injection point ) per dose , was not reported per trial . &quot;
&quot; the share of vacc@@ ines that reported over severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine are reported with ambient temperature or during the 3 @-@ cans vacc@@ ines with a combination of 360 EL@@ ISA@@ - units of the combination of hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B virus , was not statistically different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , which were conducted at vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the serum rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9,1 % was a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , a month 6 ab@@ orted dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ oc@@ onic rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , a month 6 ab@@ orted dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a compar@@ ative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two cans of ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combination of three doses . &quot;
&quot; in the 289 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ icity was useful , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 according to the gift of the 3 dose . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which were reached in a clinical reference study at 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds after the end of the full vaccine series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ doses vaccine with ambient temperature or a 3 @-@ cans vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface . &quot;
&quot; in people who were at the time of Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ ing between 12 and 15 years old , the per@@ sist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies were tested for at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with ambient temperature in 0 @-@ 6 months . &quot;
this study observed immune reaction to both anti@@ gens was comparable to the vaccination of 3 doses using a combination @-@ sim@@ ulated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hep@@ at@@ it@@ is@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
&quot; in a clinical trial of 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the per@@ sist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS @-@ antibodies were observed 24 months after immun@@ isation in 0 @-@ 6 months vaccination scheme . &quot;
&quot; when the first dose of ambi@@ ence was administered at the same time in the second year of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ ie@@ - , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ul@@ um per@@ t@@ uss@@ - , in@@ activated Poli@@ omyel@@ itis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us Chem@@ enz@@ ae type b @-@ vacc@@ ines ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or the first dose of a combined meas@@ les m@@ öt@@ t@@ um vaccine was administered . &quot;
&quot; a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults , showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ting rates , as for previous formulation . &quot;
the vaccine is both before and after the res@@ us@@ cs on any other side particles and / or physical visible changes .

&quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as by bathing in water contam@@ inated waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix is unable to protect complete before an infection with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child is not yet un@@ comfortable or ill ) you may not feel an illness of a vaccine .
&quot; protection against other infections that cause the liver damage or symptoms which are similar to those after hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , cannot be convey@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; • If you have an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix , or any component of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) . &quot;
an allergic reaction can be seen from it@@ ching skin rash , breathing need or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child has a severe infection with fever . &quot;
&quot; • If you would like to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months , prior to the scheduled appointment of the second vaccination dose ) . &quot;
&quot; with a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination , the doctor will take you / your child from a vaccination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; instead , he will recommend you / your child 3 injec@@ tions of a combin@@ ated Hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective hepatitis C virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a reform@@ ulated hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) . &quot;
the second vaccination dose of this vaccine is usually administered a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccination protection prior to the termination of the vaccination series .
&quot; sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is suffering from people who are caused by severe blood cl@@ ots suffer from the skin and not into muscle tissue . if you / your child is weak@@ ened due to a condition or treatment in your body &apos;s own defense / or if you / your child shall under@@ go a hem@@ aly@@ sis / under@@ go . &quot;
&quot; ambient can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons can not be sufficient , so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccine is . &quot;
21 Say to your doctor if you / your child takes up more medicines ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without a prescription ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated or in@@ sist@@ ence ( antibodies ) have been administered or this in the near future .
&quot; however , it can be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient for the vaccine and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine will be given simultaneously with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and can be vacc@@ inated by different lim@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; if ambient rix are given to the same time or shortly before or after a injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the response to the vaccine is still sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , ambi@@ ence fluctu@@ ations or l@@ act@@ ating women are not needed , except it is urgent that it is vacc@@ inated both against hepatitis A and hepatitis B . &quot;
important information on certain other components of ambi@@ ence . please inform your doctor if your child has shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiot@@ ic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and make a new date as soon as possible . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packages to 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packages to 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data , which has become known since the issu@@ ing of the first approval for the in@@ traffic , the CH@@ MP stepped down that the value @-@ risk ratio for ambient temperature remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) was limited to traffic , the available security data for this medicine is limited to low patient exposure . &quot;
ammon@@ ium may also be used in patients at the age of more than one month with in@@ complete en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage after high ammon@@ ium concentrations ) in the history of history .
&quot; ammon@@ ium is split - split by several individual outlets at meals - swallowed , shu@@ ff@@ led among the food , or over a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ y tea ( due to the stomach @-@ leading hose ) or a nose probe ( through the nose in the gast@@ ric hose ) . &quot;
&quot; there was no compar@@ ative study , since Ammon should not be compared to other treatment or placebo ( a drug medicine that could be compared to the active ingredient ) . &quot;
&quot; ammon@@ ium may also lead to appeal loss , a ab@@ nor@@ ms of acidity in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid re@@ ten@@ tion , abdominal pain , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , un@@ pleasant body od@@ or or weight gain . &quot;
&quot; in conclusion , the Committee for Human@@ itarian Ar@@ tic@@ ist ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that ammon@@ ess is effective in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle . &quot;
Ammon@@ ites was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; because of the condition of the condition at the time of approval only limited information to this medicine .
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete enzyme of enzyme already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late mani@@ fold form ( in@@ complete enzyme defect , which is manifested after the first life of life ) there is an indication for the use when in the history of hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; for babies , children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in granite . &quot;
the daily dose is individually calculated using the protein tolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient .
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children weighing less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children weighing 20 kg and in adults and adults . &quot;
&quot; in patients who suffer an early mani@@ fold deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ c@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
patients with a arg@@ in@@ os@@ uc@@ cin@@ ce deficiency must be in@@ arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing , as a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , if the tablets are not immediately reached in the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used with con@@ cili@@ atory cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency or severe genetic in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium re@@ ten@@ tion and de@@ mic formation only with caution . &quot;
&quot; because metabol@@ ites and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used in patients with liver or kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency only with external attention . &quot;
the significance of these results in terms of pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is contra@@ dict@@ ated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ ons and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
it also found a delayed matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth .
&quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic are divor@@ ced in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ dict@@ ated during the breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least one undes@@ irable event ( AE ) , and 78 % of those adverse events were assumed that they were not faced with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tic female patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with Lak@@ ist@@ azi@@ de , P@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ie , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; in case of an overdose , an average dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) was a case of overdose . &quot;
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic acet@@ ate that showed an intraven@@ ous dos@@ ing doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
&quot; phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic is a met@@ abo@@ lically active compound , which is con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys . &quot;
stur@@ d@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric at@@ oms ) ; therefore phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
&quot; 5 patients with dis@@ ru@@ ptions of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed , that for every gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate between 0.@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen can be produced . &quot;
&quot; it is important to improve the diagnosis early and treatment immediately , in order to improve survival opportunities and clinical outcome . &quot;
&quot; the progn@@ osis of the early @-@ mani@@ fold form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was previously untreated , and the disease itself led with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free An@@ alog@@ a within the first life of life to death . &quot;
&quot; by hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen oxide ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic ) , protein reduced cash and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of newly @-@ born in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first life of life ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed in pregnancy and were treated already before the first appearance of hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with many to mental disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late mani@@ fold form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ hic form of the Or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ c bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate and a protein reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical state may occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ulate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidneys , with glut@@ amine with glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were obtained after the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at , with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis according to individual input and repet@@ itive gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at and its metabol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous gift of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic .
&quot; after a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at in tablets , 15 minutes after taking measur@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate were detected . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cycles or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ b@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was det@@ ectable in plasma in the next morning after rapid fasting . &quot;
&quot; in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 20 g / day oral in three individual outlets ) , the average phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma level was five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
the medication is eliminated within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine via the kidneys .
&quot; according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate had been treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken in either oral ( infants and children , who can still swal@@ low no tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing ) or via an Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ y or a nostr@@ ils . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with new@@ bor@@ ns , infant and children weighing less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 g / m ² / day with children weighing 20 kg and in adults and adults . &quot;
&quot; ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um@@ prot@@ eine in plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
&quot; in patients who suffer an early mani@@ fold deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ c@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when rat econom@@ ists were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic ( active Met@@ abo@@ lit by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ in ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyr@@ am@@ ids of the brain rin@@ d . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tic female patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with Lak@@ ist@@ azi@@ de , P@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ie , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
stur@@ d@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric at@@ oms ) ; therefore phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with dis@@ ru@@ ptions of the ur@@ inal cycle can be assumed that for every gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ is can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen . &quot;
&quot; already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical state may occur . &quot;
&quot; after a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at in granite , 15 minutes after taking measur@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate were detected . &quot;
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; in this case , the little measuring sco@@ op is 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at . &quot;
&quot; if a patient must get the medication over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS may also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases are absent liver enzymes , so they can &apos;t separate the nitrogen of waste products , which can &apos;t separate after consumption of proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; when testing laboratory studies , you need to inform the doctor that you can use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can influence the results of certain laboratory studies . &quot;
&quot; when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists when you have taken other medicines or have recently taken any prescription drug . &quot;
&quot; during the breast@@ feeding time , you can &apos;t take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine could move in breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , confusion , headache , taste distur@@ ban@@ ces , desc@@ ents of hearing , Des@@ ori@@ enti@@ re@@ ty , memory disorders and a deteri@@ oration of existing neurolog@@ ical conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; when you identify one of these symptoms , check immediately with your doctor or with the emergency recording of your hospital &apos;s introduction to a corresponding treatment . &quot;

&quot; angi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood sugar to heart ) , for example , at un@@ stable Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction ( heart failure ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction ( an abnormal measurement value at the electro@@ cardi@@ ac or E@@ KG ) . &quot;
&quot; for preventing blood cl@@ ots in patients , an@@ gi@@ ox is applied to prevent a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help patients with Ang@@ ina or heart failure to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox is with sole gift or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) with conventional combination treatment with hepatitis ( another anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and an GP@@ I . &quot;
&quot; while the PCI was often used a st@@ ent ( a short tubes , which remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a closure ) , and additionally some other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( death cases , heart failure or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients that subjected to a PCI , angi@@ ox was just as effective as Hep@@ atic , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than hepat@@ arin . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox can not be used in patients who may be sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , other deer ine or other components . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it must not be used in patients who had recently had bleeding , as well as people with heavy hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or a cardi@@ ac infection . &quot;
the Human@@ ist Committee &apos;s Committee ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that angi@@ ox is in the treatment of ACS and while a PCI path@@ o@@ ous replacement for hepatitis is .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . a approval for the transport of angi@@ ox in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / Non@@ - ST @-@ Heb@@ do in@@ far@@ ct ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) , when an early intervention is provided . &quot;
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; in case of the patient in another episode a PCI is performed , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion of the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; according to the PCI requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resumed after 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
safety and efficacy of a single Bol@@ us gift from angi@@ ox was not investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0,3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should be made . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurr@@ ence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed and administered intraven@@ ously before the use . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT is worth more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with medium @-@ severe kidney problems ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT @-@ value is below 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is a second bolt dose and check out the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate ren@@ al damage caused by II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which led to the approval , the ACT was worth 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dos@@ ing adap@@ tion at an average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
&quot; 3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) , and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients , angi@@ ox is contra@@ contra@@ cted ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be conducted 30 minutes after the termination of the intraven@@ ous hepat@@ ocy@@ te or 8 hours after the termination of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of low @-@ molecular hepat@@ ocy@@ st .
&quot; • known hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity to the active substance or other components or against deer disorders , due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of hem@@ ost@@ asis and / or ir@@ reversible co@@ ag@@ ulation disorders . • harder unnecessary hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial inhibit@@ or ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients &quot;
&quot; patients are carefully examined during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ ine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if it occur in PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in most hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages in majority of blood cases , in patients who perform a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) during the treatment in principle everywhere bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , a monitoring of IN@@ R @-@ Wer@@ ts ( International Standards Organization R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after dis@@ assem@@ bling the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine has been achieved once again before the treatment . &quot;
&quot; based on the knowledge of the mode of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ un ( hepatitis , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) can be assumed that these substances increase blood haz@@ ard . &quot;
the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ atic parameters in any case are regularly controlled in combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ cular aggreg@@ ates or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ um .
&quot; the experimental tests are in@@ adequate in terms of the pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , exc@@ use or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is administered sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm or administered as permanent fusion with insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce sufficient insulin to control the glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin can &apos;t work effectively .
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine diff@@ ers very mar@@ gin@@ ally from human insulin , and the change means that it has faster and shorter effici@@ encies than a short @-@ effective human@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two trials with a total of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in case of type 2 diabetes , in which the body insulin could not work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the efficacy was the change of the concentration of the substance gly@@ cem@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how good the blood sugar is stopped .
&quot; in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed in comparison to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , the lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra , compared to 0.@@ 30 % of human insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra must not be used in patients , possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine or any other components , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adjusted , if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can effect on blood glucose bars . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ A@@ vent@@ is Germany GmbH for placing A@@ pi@@ dra throughout the European Union . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of stomach ceiling or to apply or sub@@ cut@@ aneous in continuous in@@ fusion in the area of abdominal de@@ cks .
&quot; due to the reduced glu@@ con@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the dimin@@ ished insulin change , insulin need to be reduced in patients with a limitation of the liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of effectiveness , the mark ( normal st@@ eller ) , the insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ ink@@ delayed etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method can withdraw a change of insulin requirements . &quot;
&quot; 3 An in@@ adequate dosage or the treatment of treatment , especially in patients with a insulin @-@ proof diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and di@@ vers@@ ities . these states are potentially life threatening . &quot;
the change@@ over of a patient on another insulin type or insulin type should be done under str@@ ingent medical supervision and can make a change of dosage necessary .
&quot; the time of the adv@@ ent of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the drug profile of the used insulin , and can therefore change with the change@@ over of the therapy schem@@ as . &quot;
&quot; increases the substances that increase the blood glucose levels and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ glyc@@ emia , angi@@ ot@@ en@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , sy@@ ox@@ al@@ yl@@ line , pro@@ x@@ yl@@ ate , pro@@ x@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ tics such as Bet@@ ab@@ loos@@ ens , cl@@ on@@ id@@ ine , gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in and Reser@@ pin the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ ees counter@@ balance are being caught or missing . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies on reproduction x@@ icity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ ist in terms of pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine occurs in human breast milk , but in general insulin is neither in breast milk , nor is rec@@ ap@@ sed for oral application . &quot;
&quot; below are the clinical trials known in clinical trials , group@@ ed according to system organs and arranged according to system operations ( very common : ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; very rare ( frequency on the basis of the available data is not estimated to be estimated ) . &quot;

severe hypo@@ glyc@@ emia with consciousness can be given using a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is given by an appropri@@ ated person or is treated by an intraven@@ ous gift by a doctor .
&quot; after glucose in a hospital , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the primary cause of severe hy@@ po@@ glyc@@ emia and similar episodes . &quot;
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimul@@ ating the peripher@@ al glucose ( especially by skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as inhibit@@ ing of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be of is@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the action entry will be faster and the effect of activity is shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ em standard .
&quot; in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , is@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the therapeutic doses of 0.0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg showed a proportional to the dose of a glu@@ ed glucose effects , and with 0,3 E / kg or more a proportional increase in the glucose levels , precisely as Human@@ itarian . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine has a double @-@ fast action entry , like normal human insulin and achieves a complete glucose levels earlier than Human@@ itarian . &quot;
&quot; the data showed that during an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post@@ den@@ ial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , like with human@@ ly normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; is@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , insulin was given a better postoperative control than with human insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; is@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 15 minutes after the start of the meal , insulin is detected , a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control like in human normal insulin is reached ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin injec@@ tions in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - before ) before the beginning of the meal was given as opposed to human insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1A ) . &quot;
&quot; in gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN : after the start of the meal in comparison to human Nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - previously ) was given before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1C ) . &quot;
