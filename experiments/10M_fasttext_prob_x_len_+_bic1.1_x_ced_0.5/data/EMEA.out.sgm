<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg of hot tablets (tablets which dissolve in the mouth) as a solution for setting (1 mg / ml) and a injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B., thinking and speaking, hallucinations (listening or vision of things that are not present), Misstrust and Wahntions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a psychic illness in which patients have alternate normal episodes (periods of abnormal mood) alternately with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Abilify is used to treat severe severe episodes and prevention of various episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past."</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is applied to rapid control of increased agitation or behavioral disorders if the oral medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"for both diseases, the solution can be used or the melting tablets in patients can be applied to which the swallowing of tablets need difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="9">"patients who use other medicines at the same time as Abilify, should be adjusted the dose of Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between cerebral cells by" neurotransmitter, "i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripianzol probably affects especially as "partial agro" for the receptors for neurotransmitters Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means Aripianzol such as 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in much larger than the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin can play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, which prevents psychotic or manic symptoms, and its reaction is prevented."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the efficacy of Abilify, preventing symptoms occur in three trials over a year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the efficacy of injection solution was compared to two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia, or similar diseases resulting in irritated agitation, over a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify became more than twelve weeks of 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo that have been stabilized with Abilify in which the manic symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was observed in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from Lorazepam (a different antipsychotic medicine) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change of symptoms of patients with a standard scope of bipolar disorder or the number of patients who were examined on treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in addition, the company also led studies by to investigate how the body reabsorbs the melting tablets and the solution into import."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both studies using the injection solution showed patients, the Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction of symptoms that received placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-time studies of manic symptoms more effectively than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo did not treat the resurgence of various episodes in previously treated patients and when it was given to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify-injections in 10- or 15-mg doses have also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similar effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common adverse events of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients), headache, Nausea (nausea), headache, Nausea (fatigue), fatigue, Nausea (fatigue), fatigue and exhaustion, soothing (sleep problems), fatigue (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Commission for Humanitarian Aid (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from medium-severe some serious episodes for patients who were mostly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes of the treatment with Aripianzol spoke to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the Committee came to the result that the advantages of injection solution in the rapid control of increased agitation and behavioural problems with schizophrenia or patients with manic episodes in Bipolar-I disorder, if a oral therapy is not suitable, compared to the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a approval for the placing of Abilify in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is used for the treatment of moderate to severe some episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mostly manic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily from meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"a increased efficacy of doses over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg. a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">ABILIFY's efficacy in treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not detected.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered as clinical factors (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripianzol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicides are among psychotic diseases and affective disturbances and was reported in some cases after the onset of antipsychotic therapy and treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of a epidemiological study showed that there was no increased suicides cancer in patients with bipolar disorder compared to other anti-psychological disorder.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazol should be treated with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (Myocardial ingestion, cardiac insufficiency, conditions that are prescribed for hypotonia) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports about the treatment with Aripiprazol."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if with ABILIFY patients treated signs and symptoms of an late dyskinism, should be taken into consideration, reduce the dose or break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a mns, or a clear fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics have to be removed, including ABILIFY."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripianzol should be used in patients with critization in the anamnese or in conditions that are associated with corridors in connection with caution."</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old with Aripianzol associated with psychosis who were associated with Alzheimer's disease patients who were treated with Aripiprazol to placebo in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, there was in one of these studies, a study with fictional dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to unwanted disruined events with Aripiprazol patients."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoazide or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including ABILIFY."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are no precise risk invaluable for hyperglycemia related events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic diseases, which allow direct comparisons."</seg>

<seg id="47">"a weight gain is generally used in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar manie due to Comorbidities, the application of antipsychotics which is known for weight gain as side effects, and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripixzol on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazol is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with excessive side effects such as seals (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2-antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripixzol, but this effect is not relevant as clinically."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study of healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected to expect that other high-effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects should be undertaken."</seg>
<seg id="52">CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolites can result in higher plasma concentrations of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations in comparison to CYP2D6 extensively.</seg>
<seg id="53">"if you consider the common gift of Ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors, the potential benefits should be the potential risks to the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteasors, should have similar effects, and therefore similar dosreductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after replacing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of ABILIFY should be raised to the dose height before the accompanying therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">"diltiazem or Escuopram, or CYP2D6 are given together with ABILIFY, can be calculated with a moderate increase in Aripianzol- concentrations."</seg>
<seg id="57">Clinical trials showed doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazol per day no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3-methodology morphine) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to insufficient data situation on the safety of human beings and due to the reaction studies in the animal's concerns, this drug may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the possible benefit justifies potential risk for the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other antipsychotics, the patients should be warned against such dangerous machinery, including power vehicles, to use until they are certain that Aripianzol has no negative impact on them."</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than under placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>

<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or unintentional overdosiders were observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without any death sequence."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there are no information on the efficacy of a hemalysis in treating an overdose with Aripianzol, however, it is unlikely that hemalysis in treatment of a surplus value is, since Aripiprazol has a high plasma connection."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazol is depressed in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder on Dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1 receptor and antagonist effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripianzol showed a high affinity to Dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and for serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a receptors as well as a moderate affinity for Dopamine D4- to serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adrenches and to the histamine receptor. "</seg>

<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar-I disorder (Aripiprazol showed a placebo over 3 weeks compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="83">"in a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixer dosing patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazol showed no superior efficacy against placebo."</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two Placement- and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a Bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic traits, Aripiprazol showed a positive effect compared to placebo with lithium or Haloperidol in week 12."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used for the treatment of adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who need insulin treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is administered subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm or administered as permanent fusion with insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce sufficient insulin to control the glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or the insulin can't work effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">"insulin lulisine differs very marginally from human insulin, and the change means that it has faster and shorter efficiencies than a short-effective humanist."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"Apidra was used in combination with a long-effective insulin patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two trials with a total of 572 children aged between four and 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in case of type 2 diabetes, in which the body insulin could not work effectively, Apidra was studied in a study with 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main Indicator for the efficacy was the change of the concentration of the substance glycemylified hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that shows how good the blood sugar is stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed in comparison to a decrease of 0.14%."</seg>
<seg id="2973">"in adults with type 2 diabetes, the lowering of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra, compared to 0.30% of human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Apidra must not be used in patients, possibly sensitive (allergic) against insulin lulisine or any other components, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycaemia."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the doses of Apidra may be adjusted, if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can effect on blood glucose bars."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Germany GmbH for placing Apidra throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as a subcutaneous injection either in the area of stomach ceiling or to apply or subcutaneous in continuous infusion in the area of abdominal decks.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to the reduced gluconogenesis capacity and the diminished insulin change, insulin need to be reduced in patients with a limitation of the liver function."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"any change of effectiveness, the mark (normal steller), the insulin (normal, NPH, zinkdelayed etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the production method can withdraw a change of insulin requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 An inadequate dosage or the treatment of treatment, especially in patients with a insulin-proof diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diversities. these states are potentially life threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">The changeover of a patient on another insulin type or insulin type should be done under stringent medical supervision and can make a change of dosage necessary.</seg>
