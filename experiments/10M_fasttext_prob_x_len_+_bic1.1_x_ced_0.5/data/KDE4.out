&quot; the package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite their low size , they offer some additional functions and simpli@@ fy the use of several functions of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; by making this easier available . &quot;
for more information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and in the built @-@ in functions you will find in the manual on &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; .
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select settings extensions .... open the card tool , and select the desired modules there . &quot;
this is a list of standard modules from the package K@@ DE ; add @-@ ons . please note that even more modules have installed on your system if you have any additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package that compiled &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; before you comp@@ ile this package .
&quot; to use the crash module , click on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for the crash , or the list of departure , if available . &quot;
the module ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under ex@@ tras check filters . with the module you can filter &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; &quot; s actual work directory on different kind of filters .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in the &amp; kon@@ qu@@ or ; select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and thus open a new window with the DO@@ M which is currently displayed . as pre@@ set the ad begins with the root mark of the document , for example : the element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ strate of this root property . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative to the different symbols and text views to view the content of your local file system .
&quot; the special feature of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in it to depic@@ t folder folder with the help of a so @-@ called Tree map . tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in snow@@ y structures . each object must possess the property that the sum of the inferior objects is smaller , or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; at &amp; FS@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or a folder , whereby the size of a file is specified as the sum of the size of entries in it . according to this way , it can be easily detected in the folder hier@@ archy . consequently , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you can be considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation a rectangle , which represents a file or a folder in your file system . for easier navigation use the rec@@ tan@@ gles of meaningful colour and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the colour of a rectangle , which is switched over view of color mode , can be either depth to the light detection of the screw @-@ up or display of another file name like name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type . &quot;
&quot; a rectangle can be labeled with the various characteristics of the corresponding file or the folder . for each feature you can determine if it is displayed at all , only if enough space is present or whether the area of sub@@ ordin@@ ated rectangle may occur if you can define the relative position of the label in the rectangle . &quot;
&quot; in case algorith@@ ms for Tre@@ em@@ aps should usually be kept that the area is proportional to size . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View ; this target will not always be stopped . note that less space is lost for the frame , if the rectangle is square . &quot;
&quot; as distribution of a entry is provided for the sub@@ ordin@@ ated entries , the implementation is left up . here it is for the label and avo@@ idance of space losses due to always beneficial the areas that are square . the best methods of this in terms are lines , columns or recur@@ sive second healing . &quot;
&quot; you can set the minimum bed area for an entry on the menu entry , keep on surface . instead , a slide pattern is drawn into the area of the superior entry , to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an under@@ lined entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; FS@@ View ; as little test application and introduction into the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ get , was designed to use K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ rin@@ d application . &quot;

&amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; contains a fast image processing with basic image processing tools . you can use these to view and correct your photos . processing power can be easily expanded with K@@ DE image plug@@ ins Interface ( manual ) modules .
&quot; although &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; easy to use , it provides a dozens of professional skills . it works all in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the convertible using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC color management efficiency . &quot;
&quot; improved database with significantly more met@@ ad@@ ata , such as &amp; eg ; via camera or lens that can be searched for . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; K@@ DE ; programs is also &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; an open source project . that means , it depends on the support of the extension of the end@@ ent . they should therefore report problems and improvement options . &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; try to make the mil@@ king of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , your web browser opens a page in the error report . all required information is already registered here . only follow the instructions to send your report . &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; is a project that is supported by a community . i.e. , the user and developer will help each other . if you wish to answer any more regular users of &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; and hopefully you may answer any questions of other users . in this mailing list , you should be so powerful . &quot;
you can also visit the di@@ gi@@ l ; homepage to visit news on shared releases and other information about &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; to learn .
the best start to participate in &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; is the registration in the developer mail@@ ing@@ list . instructions for the report in the developer mail@@ ing@@ list of &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; .
&quot; if you come &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; for the first time , you will be asked if you want to store your pictures and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply click on the folder icon of folder icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you have to specify a local file on your computer . here , the dat@@ ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders . &quot;
later you can add as many files as you would like to add . &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; you will additionally use as a library library . settings di@@ gi@@ k@@ am set up .
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top file , the pictures contains as basic file . &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; viewed every sub@@ folder as an album . no picture is changed . during the search of the ste@@ wards , you can see a progress indicator like this : &quot;
&amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; dur@@ ations recur@@ sively the li@@ br@@ arian spl@@ ash in its whole depth . you can do no under@@ ord@@ ship unless it is in swe@@ pt folder . this allows you to add an extra point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as basic folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ en@@ list has no photos as symbols . you can change it as an alb@@ um@@ icon . this will then be used as an album symbol . more details can be found in the Albums section . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set in &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; you should learn your digital camera . afterwards , you should learn how to manage your albums and my key@@ word box to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw material support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , then you can handle it . possibly the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ f library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu help Roh@@ kam@@ er@@ a@@ support . &quot;

&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera site will be available to you with your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; of course , every medium and any card reader who is supported by your operating system will work together with &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by using Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera can also be implemented as a plate rack . the camera can also be used as a plate rack . the camera can also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports communication with digital cameras , which has been developed by the International Imag@@ ing Industry Association for digital cameras , which is a widespread number of digital cameras supported by the International Imag@@ ing Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to machines and other peripher@@ als without the need of additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine . since photos in general are big files and transfers over the serial port , this connection is now ob@@ sol@@ ete . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; supports these cameras and leads the transmission of the pictures featuring g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support , so you can read images of di@@ gi@@ k@@ am reliably . if the EX@@ IF support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may be able to prove anything or the generation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the pret@@ ti@@ est things to &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; is how easy to expand his functionality by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE image plug@@ ins interface project ( manual ) is a approach to develop a joint fashion structure for &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . aim is to provide modules for all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate pictures in almost any way , as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; through the writing of a small module by adding a function when the changes in &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; itself . &quot;
&quot; to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either remove the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;

&quot; met@@ ad@@ ata is defined as data on data . met@@ ad@@ ata are defined according to your definition data , information about or documentation of other data , which are administered by an application or surroundings . &quot;
&quot; I would claim to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you do not need to find a specific photo . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t want to save &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have guaranteed to store up with other programs , platforms and formats freely . &quot;
&quot; the first you do and know what to do in your system , the structure of information is organized in contrast to data structure . your photo files must be arranged somehow on your computer , whether you want to save them on a reserved drive &amp; etc ; make sure you need to switch to a larger drive . &quot;
&quot; maybe you &apos;ll be happy with this structure . tourist images can be found fast over your memory location , unless you were interested in one year . if you &apos;re using enough photos , you will be able to print them as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is a folder for pictures you can print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archi@@ ving , work processes , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % of work files and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what kinds of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes stap@@ le processing easier . separ@@ ating new files from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are searching for an original or derived picture .
&quot; we also recommend the met@@ ad@@ ata option to store met@@ ad@@ ata in the settings of the met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; di@@ gi@@ l . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? this is &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; you have a met@@ ad@@ ata Editor for a number of selected attributes . these are the most important . &quot;
&quot; now the real work begins , since you should select any photo keywords , labelling and evaluation . of course you can select all the pictures that will select the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense when you can concentrate on the best photos on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s continue with key@@ words , key@@ words , as you proceed in other programs often , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; when you import catalog@@ ed pictures from another source with embedded images , then &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; automatically add the tree for you to build the image within the tree is no problem and can easily be done by moving out of a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed cap@@ tures will be updated by &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; updated , while the sub @-@ trees are pursued . &quot;
the graphic shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata is over@@ cut . this is a very rough representation since each block consists of met@@ ad@@ ata in truth from many sections . data names and calendar data are all properties .
&quot; enough of the keywords : the next section refers to inscri@@ ptions , or comments , the third important tool to catalog@@ u@@ ate your met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; most of you want to just see your photos easily , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are sure to be interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; check out this panorama . out of the distance it is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at closer , then start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say to you this of the Lan@@ de@@ platz of the Allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in French Nor@@ mand@@ y , 60 years after landing , memories , the historical period of time is again present , you may even hear the silence of this panorama . &quot;
&quot; for others who consider your photos , the title is possibly more important than the image itself . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is the meaning that you are moving about the motive that you understand what you understand . &quot;
&quot; it is ok if a picture is not perfect , if the strength is only with a labelling for itself alone . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; you can deliver a lot of text , in an internation@@ alised alpha@@ bet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , and you can even use it for a selection of images at the same time . you can tell your pictures to your wishes and / or the title of Web @-@ gallery . you need to tell it a second time for the opening . &quot;
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without a navigation system ? was they not a boring planet from Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now has a light speed . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities offered by ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alisation are already visible and are still deeper into the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can also export your journeys using ge@@ ographic data . you can also export the pictures at the recording location . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Google Maps viewer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice of using copyright to remove restrictions concerning the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information in the setting side of &amp; di@@ gi@@ l came ; as information should be deposited on :
&quot; author ( Syn@@ onym for writer and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo . if it is not desired , the name of a company or organization can be used . after which this value is stored once , it should no longer be changed as separ@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; Aut@@ ort@@ itel ( syn@@ onymous with the author ) : associ@@ ating the author . this field contains the name of the photographer . examples may be titles as : employee photographer , Free photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a comment on the author , this must be completed . &quot;
&quot; editor ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the An@@ bi@@ eter@@ field to identify those who offer the photo . if the photographer does not necessarily need to be the author , if the photo is a warehouse photo , then the group / agency will offer the image here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they have no protection against mis@@ use . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in work with calcul@@ ator . for individuals , this problem is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; will provide such a module for stap@@ le processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : record release , record loss , power ratings , EC@@ C , transmission error , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , des@@ ast@@ er@@ ing , life time , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ st@@ itions &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs which could be lost on the street or a fire . this kind of losses are the same as you can happen with traditional paper photos or negatives . in this section it concerns problems with the so @-@ called new media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll On@@ Track , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics that has a data loss . &quot;
&quot; to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , this pre@@ stige is treated and you can &apos;t take more than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs . of course , you can also download CDs and DVDs . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 of the piece that is a lifetime of 100 years for itself . if you believe this is in your discretion . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you can use good Dis@@ ks and good recording applications . the best DVD recording sessions are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you are so much reliable . it is therefore the right to select . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to mistakes even if you have just written just before . therefore , they use a control system mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are just effective data , the rest we needed for form@@ att@@ ing and the control environment . despite this massive prot@@ ru@@ ptions it requires chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs , there &apos;s a reasonable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster &apos;s seem@@ ingly wonders on CDs and DVDs . it &apos;s also not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged flo@@ ppy disks , hard drives , flash drives , USB drives etc . &quot;
&quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to save the For@@ mat@@ s against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all of which has been said to CDs and DVDs , of course also applies to the Blu @-@ ray disc . &quot;
&quot; burn slowly with a good recording feature on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ety format . read the media with a description , date &amp; author marks and afterwards on a clean , dark dry and protected against animals . do not forget to read the data on the next generation of hardware or software that can read these media . &quot;
&quot; flo@@ ppy manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturers include a new disk , but not the data . Google exhibits a large field study about the error mechan@@ isms of hard drives : dis@@ missing data &quot;
&quot; soon : Dis@@ ks keep the longest if you are operated in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In the lower temperature control , the error rate can not determine the im@@ min@@ ent failure . some of SM@@ ART may termin@@ ate this error . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only about the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a power case before you have secured the files , but these losses are normally not able to recover . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical equipment is not much , the devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed spro@@ uts are different . these can cause serious damage , complete data loss , soft@@ war@@ age , destroyed motor boards and other defects . protect yourself from the inev@@ itable which leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; most widespread protection against power tips is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is absorbed by the energy intake and the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ bar . do not think any plug @-@ in bar also contains a Over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should make sure that it provides the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a specific minimum of protection . you should also make sure that it protects against lighten@@ ing flash , and thus protects the devices correctly . &quot;
&quot; since an over@@ voltage of any cable can be used on your computer , you should make sure that even all peripher@@ als can be connected to your system . some manufacturers are also available for telephone lines and cable mode@@ ms , which can also provide a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for co@@ axial cable and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks , and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . so you are ideal for travelling . &quot;
&quot; while a over@@ voltage protection system protects your system from smaller variations in the power lines , it will not really help you . even a failure of few seconds can lead to the loss of int@@ oler@@ able data . it can therefore be sensible to invest in an un@@ interru@@ pt power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide a power loss . this gives you the possibility to store your data and run the system . if you have a UPS then you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . moreover , the life time of the battery and the included software will be interesting . &quot;
&quot; concerns the potential risk of reducing your computer system and compare its safety at power disorders with the cost of avoiding these . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W UPS can be protected as well as you should remember all cables before you go to vacation . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web @-@ service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to store this as a backup destination for your software . Google Shared Storage is another popular offering to store data . &quot;
&quot; however , you are in comparison to hard drives at home however very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . moreover , you need to send the data via the compar@@ atively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . it is too slow . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB . your free memory is available to you more , in the case of Fli@@ ck@@ r dramatically . for $ 25 a year you get unlimited memory which should only be checked in reality . &quot;
&quot; from the perspective of data backup , the Web @-@ solutions are very secure . transmission errors will be automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and included in the large companies this offer a backup and a ver@@ itable memory . so they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ ous . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all transfers are due to transmission errors . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs provide at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
&quot; the worst thing is that no one says when a transmission error occurred , not if this is in your hardware . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ discovered until you have no protection in your computer . nobody ever seems to have it in your computer . no one seems to have thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a significantly more secure database than that in your computer . &quot;
un@@ reliable networks are another source for transfers since they generate interest rates within data streams . at normal fil@@ esystem these errors remain un@@ noticed .
&quot; even if you are currently not affected by transfers problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 , you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS by Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates that can handle with turn@@ tables on lower level and can be scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one to the GP@@ L compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will be available soon for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English . &quot;
&quot; Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ oh@@ fs file system . this is still in the alpha status . it is still using the same protective mechanisms , it is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel . &quot;
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in not@@ ebook and 46 % for job systems . not@@ ebooks is already the share of theft 50 % .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most of them . it leads to a lower damage , for example , theft or new installations . and there is currently on Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; for long no more sigh@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : false , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to see the common file systems . find a very good English article here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : false , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and a definite status is avoided . if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that the technology develops a natural limit for these progress . sensitivity and noise characteristic for all types of light sensors are no longer removed from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xels . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is the optim@@ um for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras will need your limit at 10 @-@ 12 Megapixel . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; now you get a 750@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so you don &apos;t get any other data loss for data loss . so , you &apos;ll get your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous as the new installation of your operating system , exchange records or the size of the hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make daily your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash , you will be lucky when the drive was not connected . &quot;
&quot; a disaster proposes locally to and destroyed a lot . don &apos;t forget an airplane disaster : fire , water , electricity , children and theft . they usually affect all the room or the whole house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , disaster in@@ fle@@ ction means a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the steps , into the neighbouring house , in your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as already said , a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup not immediately available , then you can save one day . &quot;
&quot; complete backup : a complete backup of all files must be secured . it is a moment , without history and represents a complete copy at a time . &quot;
differentiation : to backup the files have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete moment of time : the complete backup and the result of the last differential .
&quot; incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files have been changed since the last backup . this creates several moment of moments . you can restore the original status at any time again . this backup comes with an exception of the exception that it is used only , and not continually continuously . &quot;
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool which you can easily set up easily on your machine . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts only the difference of files that really have been changed . this happens and if you want to increase the safety via ssh .
get important pictures directly after you saved them on your computer on a DVD or another optical media .
&quot; this approach allows you to explore losses and restore losses . at the same time , you get a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly basis for at least one month and a moment for each month . every further th@@ inner should happen manually , after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original retain , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ ent images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copying the pictures to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visible devices , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; thus valuable pictures will survive the next 40 year , that &apos;s about the time span in which you really are interested in you because she will remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; because the future is un@@ pre@@ dict@@ able because of its nature , everything is said to be careful with caution and re @-@ evaluate it while the time flies . unfortunately , there is no other way to ass@@ ert itself as the current system backward . the less variants you have in the past , the easier is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered with explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtu@@ alization is available nowadays for everyone . if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures , then store it and install it in a virtual machine for a later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you can change your computer architecture , memory and safety technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer default . stay in open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the professional print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this is actually bigger .
let &apos;s go out which you have planning the scal@@ ability and put the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition . at * ni@@ x systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this section and dis@@ semin@@ ate them on a new record :
&quot; with the command d@@ mes@@ g , check if your new record was detected by the system , but do not hang them . &quot;
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / S@@ DC # Source is / dev / S@@ DC # Source ; par@@ ted re@@ size / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of disk in MB@@ gt ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS if necessary &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can be read , then you can create them . this task will be easier from year to year . &quot;
&quot; G@@ IF is a proprietary , patented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . therefore you should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; P@@ NG was designed as an open source standard for G@@ IF . however , it is much more . it &apos;s loss @-@ free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata , but not as many as T@@ IF@@ F requires and a slow compression . this format we recommend you to store your pictures . &quot;
&quot; T@@ IF@@ F was widely used as picture format . T@@ IF@@ F can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a low @-@ free compression salt ( de@@ fl@@ ate ) . however , it manages images in this format . a problem is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
D@@ NG The Digital Negative file format is a licensed free and open @-@ image format that Adobe Systems has been developed . it is based on the T@@ IF@@ F / EP format and is required to use met@@ ad@@ ata . a hand@@ ful camera manufacturers are now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource targets ; X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible met@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a blend of XML and R@@ DF ; it is stored for the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers run it from an original of your recording , mostly in the rough format , to archive file format . however , it can cause problems with the link between the met@@ ad@@ ata and the picture file and as mentioned above is superior to whether you use D@@ NG as container and place everything together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core met@@ ad@@ ata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ ad@@ ata standards and support the activities of D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I work groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ful efforts to achieve an ongoing acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera field , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert Roh@@ files to D@@ NG and save them in your sc@@ opes . this function is not implemented yet .
&quot; for a sensitive processing , you can use external programs . if you have returned the pictures with &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted , then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these were cut off under the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the processed pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only in Web@@ gal@@ eries , code in MPEG , use in contact leaves , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; di@@ gi@@ l . in the section adding a photos to an album , you can add a description of how you can already add photos that you have already on your hard disk . the camera interface offers you many advanced settings to import images to your alb@@ end@@ ata bench . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted , you connect these with the machine , turn the camera on display mode and turn it off . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , you try to connect to your camera . when the connection is made , a Fer@@ tig -@@ indicator appears at the lower end and the pictures of all photos on the camera will appear . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol of file association will appear on the camera . if this is the case , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you can download the photos on your computer , you may need to see the camera information to each entry . with the lateral qualities and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of a entry or his met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; this dialog shows file characteristics and photo information , the internally saved by the camera . a symbol shows that the image has not been downloaded on your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have any information available at some digital cameras . &quot;
&quot; the rider Metad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer notice , GPS , etc. of the picture . this information is the same as the met@@ ad@@ ata side bar from the main window of &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; or the image editing . note that these met@@ ad@@ ata is not available at some digital cameras . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to download photos on their computer , click the button to download and then download the selection of all . this invites the photos from their camera into a single album and we recommend you to check if the pictures are secure in an album before you delete pictures from the camera . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired selection methods of &amp; K@@ DE ; as soon as you choose the photos selected , you can download the button . you can download the button chosen as long as you &apos;ve selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , you can download a new option . these pictures have been downloaded from &amp; di@@ gi@@ l . in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star window . if you select this option , only the new pictures are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; if you can download the buttons Show more or selected download , a dialogue with which you can select the target album , in which the photos can be selected as normal files can be displayed in the section &quot; &quot; folder . &quot; &quot; then select the target album out of the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after which you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; invites the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete this from the camera . you can delete it all at once by using the button del@@ eting . if you only want to delete a few , then you have to delete it first and delete del@@ eting Selected . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to delete pictures you deleted from the camera . so you should not check if the photos will be deleted in a &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; so you should not delete the photos successfully when you want to er@@ ase the camera through the camera , because this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos often not particularly compens@@ ated for photos . this can result in double fil@@ en@@ ames in the same album , if you have done photos of several shooting sequence in the same album , in which the image has been made to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for turning and sk@@ e@@ wers for the picture and dat@@ e@@ based sub@@ cut@@ ters . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day . &quot;
&quot; the options During the transmission will open three further options that are carried out before the photos are stored on the record . if you select it , the corresponding entries from the EX@@ IF information is copied into the IP@@ TC fields . with the latest option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want a different file format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo@@ - % Y@@ - % 0 % H : % M . switch the option time &amp; time . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the command stro@@ f@@ time . &quot;
&quot; if you use the camera fil@@ en@@ ames option , you have the option to change the file name in small letters . or in case letters , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; di@@ gi@@ l , is used for a photo , is displayed below the name which displays the camera in preview . your settings can be stored and automatically used for the next time you can open the camera window . &quot;
&quot; you can use all information about the orientation of the camera to the timing of the recording , and not all cameras provide this information ready . in section lateral met@@ ad@@ ata , you can read more details about the information that has embedded your camera into the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is normally turned on , and when your camera do not supplies this information , the photo is in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the button Extended and select the automatic rotation in the lower section of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera has information on the date on which the photo was made , can be downloaded &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; this sub@@ cut@@ ters are based on the image data . all images with the same date can be downloaded in the same album . all pictures with the same date can be read , which information can have embedded your camera into the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually switched off , and in this case , &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , you &apos;ll need to switch this option . use the button @-@ based sub@@ cut@@ ters at the lower end of the window . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to load photos from their hosts on their camera is the button download . select the file extensions holder &amp; K@@ DE ; it appears that you can select the file extensions holder &amp; K@@ DE ; you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; K@@ DE ; methods . &quot;
&quot; after the picture selection is done , you wonder where the pictures are uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the pictures will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Position@@ ing System ) is used as a general term in this document . therefore , a position is meant that can be displayed in long@@ itude and lat@@ itude and can be displayed on a map . the identification of the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographs , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to carto@@ graph@@ ically . environmental planning , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo was made , you can send a browser to another &amp; di@@ gi@@ l . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; users want to locate the place of the photographs , or simply just document this aspect , it is good to submit to the photos of a photos . &quot;
&quot; the question is how to get the GPS data into the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 many GPS data fields , such as direction , artic@@ els and map refer@@ enced . there are at least three ways to reach this . directly with the right hardware , via a reproduction of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for the ge@@ ographic assignment ( manual ) and last via the manual input of well @-@ known locations . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that is integrated into a GPS unit . however , there are a few that work with GPS recipi@@ ents . either as map module or via transmission of data using a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;

downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ one or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . but you have to save these data from the GP@@ X format as this is the only format that is supported by the module to geographical assignment .
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract data of images and of the GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; make : ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and lat@@ itude or other data , you can use this script which works with the Ex@@ if@@ tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the pre@@ defined coordinates using e.g. map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street cards . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , all the navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; try to give you as much control over its operations as possible . there are many settings that change the behaviour of &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted . to set up on these settings , you need to set up in eight sides . you can change between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left . &quot;
&quot; action can be set on embedded preview or image editing , so you can set the default behavior of &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; fixed when you click on an entry in the main view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standard candidate and copyright data . these data are automatically written in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , if the option is syn@@ ced from the camera resolution . this data is also written in the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; Aut@@ ort@@ itel is a syn@@ onym for the editor : this field should contain the label of photographers , as a freelance photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a detailed description of the author , this must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this must not be the author , if this is a photo agency such as Reuters or Associated Press , then these organizations should be registered here , then the group or agency will be available here . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC actions save the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ der@@ s. by this way , the met@@ ad@@ ata is permanently contained in the picture and not only in the database of &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; these met@@ ad@@ ata is also available , and can not be imported into &amp; di@@ gi@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; photo shots as embedded in JPEG pictures : this is synchron@@ ized the comments which you can add to your photos , with the pictures embedded in pictures of pictures . attention : in pictures which have already been inscri@@ bed , these are over@@ written by the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ans ; over@@ written . &quot;
&quot; the page settings contains all options for the information appearing in the main window of a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; di@@ gi@@ fted ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to determine which file types &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted , you can add the file extensions of this list and remove any file in a &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; Alb@@ um@@ folder that has no such expan@@ sions , ignored by &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; ignored . &quot;
default settings can be reset back by pressing the button updates on the right of each category .
&quot; the settings of the lumin@@ osity of &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; can be set on this page on the default settings . every images can then be switched on . some pictures have different sizes and syn@@ ch@@ rone . if you have one , then you can only get better results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select this here . you can use the tool@@ bar when you use image processing in full @-@ screen mode . &quot;
&quot; over@@ - and lower areas of a picture can be marked with dark or brigh@@ ter color in the image . these colors are defined here . in image editing , this review can be switched with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 . &quot;
&quot; with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , it is meant that pictures are encoded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for the next explanation . &quot;
&quot; using the P@@ NG compression mode , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality as P@@ NG requires a loss of loss . if you have a fast calcul@@ ator , you can set this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 compression . &quot;
&quot; with the T@@ IF@@ F file option , you can turn off the de@@ fl@@ ate compres@@ sion@@ ism for T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . it has no influence on the image quality as the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm has been working . &quot;
&quot; the ratio of loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files can store you loss @-@ free . even if you select the loss of loss , the relationship between quality loss and file size is much better than at normal JPEG . when this paragraph has not been supported , met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported , but was in planning . &quot;
&quot; in the previous versions of &amp; di@@ gi@@ l , the image editing is only a picture viewer for photos . currently it develops very quickly to a tool for mani@@ pulation of your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the standard version is that all green pixels are equal to ultra@@ violet light . if you use this option , this difference is a bit soft , elimin@@ ating this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option records this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option records a little soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 pattern with the V@@ NG@@ - or A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white is used in the camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is used only if the white @-@ off is not set . standard , there is a solid color balance which was photographed on a white map that was photographed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . using the second sensors the effect can get more details in four steps more details into the head@@ lights . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
&quot; the standard is the head@@ light , so the parts of your pictures are burned , as well as the in@@ ability to consider the top white in the settings . the setting colors will solve some unusual results , as they can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the head@@ lights . &quot;
&quot; this is possible , as blue pixels generally not be satis@@ fying such as green and red . &amp; di@@ gi@@ w therefore try the missing green and red proportions of the still not saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question , how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option , you get the option to set up one level . here is a value of three compromise and can therefore be adjusted for each picture separately . &quot;
&quot; put the L@@ umin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably need to set him somewhat higher than standard 1 . however , this may also be made in the imag@@ ery options of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; in order to keep the time for den@@ os@@ a@@ icing , you should be conservative . &quot;
&quot; a me@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process that features a complete picture of the partial data , which is available from the colour @-@ filtered image sensor that is available to many cameras and also known an Matrix @-@ color pixel . this algorithm is also known as CFA @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction . &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ w came on ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm used by myself . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know your lenti@@ ls of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correc@@ tions here . this is certainly the best method for colour@@ less correction , since you will be convertible during the shell conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the colour information and gives instructions to be given back . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; information like the color space of a color space in the others are so accurate as possible .
&quot; behavior Questions , if a picture is opened in image processing / colour management module with Roh@@ files . &quot;
&quot; colour profile folder S@@ itting file the folder , such as / usr / share / color / NT / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you will save all your profiles . &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; follow these ste@@ wards then during the start . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles you have the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profile . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color does not manage the entire screen .
&quot; the input profile should be used to the camera manufacturers and model that you can use . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain any color mapping or gamma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma is not necessary for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to do the color mapping themselves . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , which you can em@@ ulate as your image has been changed from a device . this is very useful before you can print a smaller color range than your camera and a few colors , therefore , you could manually adjust to the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious which the colour profile is fore@@ seen for them . unfortunately , there is not a table of cameras and profiles to fit together . this answer is of course un@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extension makes the style for the goal : F for precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutr@@ ally , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; K@@ DE ; image Plu@@ gin interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; K@@ DE ; image @-@ related and image processing is supported ; many modules support , which have been written to cooperate with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you &apos;ll see a list of available modules . select those from you want to use and these will be downloaded from &amp; di@@ gi@@ l . these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and beyond . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks , which are performed by modules , can be set in the menu under Settings . &quot;
&quot; for more information ( in English ) , you can get over the K@@ IP@@ I project via htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org , or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the Di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper kno@@ b is adjusted to adjust the time between the image outputs , usually are 4 @-@ 5 seconds good . the other instructions can turn off the met@@ ad@@ ata a res@@ or , which are embedded in the lower end of the pictures during the display . &quot;
&quot; camera characteristics show a list of all the cameras supported on the left . on the right side there is a button automatic detection , which is tried to identify the camera that is connected to the computer . currently , serial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are currently supported . &quot;
&quot; at the lower end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active when you select a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you have to specify the path here , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ ash / or , on which you hang your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; you need to connect the camera to your computer , put them in the display mode . &quot;
&quot; pro@@ bi@@ ere you out of whether &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if you don &apos;t , you can set camera production and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . if you have more than one camera , you can add all of them here . &quot;
&quot; with the option of confirmation dialog for the shift of &gt; images in the tr@@ ash@@ can display , you can adjust the talk of a photos in an album . in the del@@ eting of a photos and del@@ e@@ tion of an album you can find further details . &quot;
the editorial changes due to the right side bar can be shut down by &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; if you use the option changes in the right side bar without re@@ qu@@ ire . otherwise you have to store the changes with the button changes .
you can also specify the display of a welcome screen of &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; when starting out ; this will accelerate the starting process of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ans .
&quot; the setting of the new photos are looking for new photos and look for the base folder according to new or deleted albums / photos . if something from the base folder was extingu@@ ished , she asks &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; she asks , whether it is to er@@ ase these from the database . &quot;
different color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; used to adapt the main window to your taste . this settings can be used under settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text@@ files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; you will find further information about this tut@@ orial .
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use this to view your photos and improve the image editing , click a preview of a picture or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry @-@ on display / editing . &quot;
the image editing contains a range of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; you are not part of your distribution . more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in paragraph Image Processing .
&quot; a status bar at the bottom edge of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size . &quot;
&quot; one menu bar at the upper edge , and including the tool@@ bars for quick access to the most commonly needed functions . &quot;
&quot; the editing functions of image editing change your photos . however , the function will change the original photo before using file storing , or install the button store from the tool@@ bar . note that you have saved the original photo once you have saved the image . &quot;
&quot; so , you should get a copy of your image , before you can change it . you can save you with file storing . &quot;
&quot; as long as you have not stored the photo , you can restore the original image by using the button restore or the button to restore image editing in the tool@@ bar . you will lose every change that you have done in the photo since the last store . &quot;
&quot; nearly every action of the image editing can be made , or re@@ produced , and the last action you can reset , by clicking editing and select re@@ produce from the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you often use this , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to restore and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; read more than the back@@ common or restore button in tool@@ bar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between are also made and restored . &quot;
&quot; once you start the image processing , you can move between the photos on the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture top , picture down or the entries in the menu file . if you have any changes in the menu , you will be asked if you want to back up . &quot;
you can come in the photo and get out zo@@ oming in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse bike or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the saf@@ est menu .
&quot; to adapt a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : Mag@@ ni@@ fication factor automatically &quot;
view Full Screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you can also use the tool@@ bar in which you don &apos;t want to change the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t want to change this in the creation dialog by &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; you can see it out of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; main window . see the section on setup of image processing .
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print the File menu and receive the Standard &amp; K@@ DE ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print individual images or whole sentences . all picture pages can select from your selection . you need to select the pictures featuring the standard methods and exp@@ orting the menu , exp@@ orting printing assist@@ ent . if you follow the wi@@ z@@ ard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; main window has a side bar at the right edge , which is important information and promotions for selected images . the same side bar is available without the navigation editing , also available in image processing . it is displayed if one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
&quot; multiple click on the same rider , the side@@ bar will appear or disappear again in the edge . &quot;
&quot; in the sign@@ posted view , you can insert mo@@ ft@@ ings with unlimited size or insert . note the note down . the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . that means all special characters are allowed in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that you can use of other programs . &quot;
the IP@@ TC @-@ data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are designed according to 2000 characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications .
&quot; after which you comments , use either the button users or simply change to the next image , the labelling will then be saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the user button there is a button More . with this , you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or the database . but you can also read the met@@ ad@@ ata in the files . this is always done when you have a met@@ ad@@ ata default , which is always written into the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the review rating shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting out . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars or with the keyboard short@@ cut Str@@ g + 0 ... 5 . the evaluation from the side@@ bar will always be used simultaneously . to evaluate more pictures at the same time , select it and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field . encoding follows the scheme in the following table :
the key@@ word view shows a search@@ box for filtering of the keywords in the key@@ ring and a selection box with the previously used in this &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; -@@ session attached sample .
the key@@ word is adapted dynam@@ ically to the specified search phrase . you can restri@@ ct the number of possibilities in search of a key@@ word quickly . this ability is very useful if you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is another relief for the input of sample shots at a picture series . if you have entered various keywords , these are stored for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all tags of a picture are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
&quot; if several pictures are selected in the main view and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not on the whole selection , if you want to choose a selection with a key@@ word , please refer to the key@@ word filter . &quot;
&quot; the page bar is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar will be used with their album , - data , key@@ word and search filters from the right side , only the cutting quantity of these two are displayed . all available keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also move and lie down . suppose you have selected several pictures in the main view . if the key@@ word exists , you can just put it out of the right side bar and put on the selection . then a dialog appears if you want to put the key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on a cal@@ ender date . the key@@ word filter stands on No more keywords , which have been selected on three images . they were drawn with C@@ tr@@ l + a . and afterwards , a key@@ word is asked whether this key@@ word is supposed to be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at any start of the program . it can also be turned off under settings .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and realize that it should be one or more , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and the control range . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry , after which is sought in the database , can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc . &quot;
&quot; 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already placed in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can define an extended search of all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need to use the cross box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options look as follows : &quot;

this article / tut@@ orial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I used it mainly on &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; s concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason why we have a color@@ fully administered workflow , which are available from your camera or scanner which are in fact that the colors are available on your monitor or scanner that are available from your camera or scanners , and the colors that you can print or in the web created from your digital dark chamber . &quot;
&quot; if the theme comes on colour management , everyone wants to know which buttons he has to express the results for the results . unfortunately , it means that you &apos;ll need enough background information about colour management . in addition to make your own informed decisions allow you to make the desired results . &quot;
&quot; if your image has fulfilled all the criteria listed below , you must not take care of colour management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is cali@@ br@@ ated on the s@@ RGB @-@ color space . ( see further information below )
&quot; your only other image expenditure is by e @-@ mail or web , where the RGB is the de facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and the life for everybody is so easy , why should I use another color space and have to make thoughts about paint h@@ anger ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the s@@ RGB compared to the colors which we really can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ br@@ ine @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the RGB color space , the tri@@ ang@@ ular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger farms , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om excellent side and then click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to cali@@ br@@ ate my monitor if I chose to work only in the RGB color space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you work in the RGB color space or do not , you &apos;ll need to install your monitor as s@@ RGB mode . if you have a RGB mode of the RGB mode , you will need to use either your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , a matching monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use a further manual processing . &quot;
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , the same , automation level and contrast expand from the menu Kor@@ rig@@ ating automatic correction to automatically experiment out of your colors . they will experiment with these effects , to see what is best in your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alizes : this method sc@@ aled the Leu@@ ven @-@ stronger the entire picture , so the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point as bright as possible , without its color sha@@ kes . this function is often a magical correction for images which are dark or washed . &quot;
&quot; compare the same method : this method is rec@@ alled the lumin@@ ance factor of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity each is as flat as possible . it is a very powerful surgery that works either wonders in a picture or destroyed it . &quot;
&quot; automatic : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright boundary tones and adjusted the red , green and blue channels on the entire history . &quot;
&quot; contrast expand : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of a picture by post@@ p@@ one the lowest and highest levels of all values in between . this is only visible when washed images , and can be a good correction for bad photos . &quot;
the bald @-@ off of &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; is a semi @-@ automated tool to perform the white off of a photos .
&quot; the white @-@ like correction is slightly restricted to a colour space of 8 @-@ bit each color . if you can perform the white cover in the raw mode , if you work in the white mode , you will get your possibilities for correction better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white em@@ bal@@ m which is protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ y@@ m . they launch it via the menu entry colors white from the image processing .
&quot; the front window can be adjusted in size . on the left , the original picture can be seen as well as the preview of the target . if you want to see the original whit@@ ish , it is enough to click on the lower window . &quot;
the preview photos of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the lumin@@ ance of the slopes under this mark@@ er is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; on the right above , a hist@@ ogram is displayed as soon as you can change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful because , even in well lit images , most pixels are very small L@@ umin@@ ant values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is indicated . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on sha@@ dows , satur@@ ation and gamma off . sha@@ dows Adjust@@ ment lets you improve your photos of your photos or drop down . &quot;
&quot; An@@ stat has to play around the above controls , you should use the color temperature Pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then click on this button to calculate the colour temperature of the white image . at this kind , temperature and green values are automatically added . &quot;
&quot; additionally , you can set the white off with the list of settings . the following settings are available : &quot;
&quot; the super@@ l@@ ator holder increase the colors , when more than a colour channel of the slopes are over@@ exposed .. you will be displayed in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image . &quot;
&quot; the buttons saving as and store exactly this . each setting of the white equ@@ is@@ ations , you can store this in a text file and later load it later . &quot;
&quot; the button pre@@ ferences will reset all the filter values back to their standard values , and the corresponding neutral white settings . note that neutral settings will be given a different photo than your original . if you store it , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; here you can adjust the code entry per color channel of the mach@@ ined image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . this coding requires even more record @-@ quality images , but is also available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IF@@ F and D@@ NG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialogue as the processing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color ton@@ ing can be carried out through the sub@@ window for the Hel@@ lig@@ ations . detailed instructions for use of color profiles can be taken to the chapter of color management .
&quot; another important tool is available in the menu of colors of sound correction . this tool provides an integrated way to store multiple color channels simultaneously . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always require the same bug and therefore you will always need the same correction . in the manual of the audio correction , please find further information . &quot;
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool of gra@@ dation that you can find under colors Gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ a.com ; tool color effects produces four color effects , a Vel@@ via filter , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and an edge filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing was Solar@@ isation , also known as Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect of the image produced by the extra light . that &apos;s the effect that the brigh@@ ter areas dar@@ ker dark and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . this tool was possible to adjust these interesting effect fine . &quot;
the intensity controls the solar cell . at approx . 50 % intensity the picture shows what chemical is possible . another increase is finally a negative image that is not able to produce phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar installation . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this is processed ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
Vi@@ vi@@ d filter sim@@ ulates the so called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it diff@@ ers from a satur@@ ation effect that makes a stronger contra@@ sting effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it easy to emb@@ ell@@ ished many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for one on daylight enhanced colour film which is produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ vet offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contra@@ sts . Vel@@ vet offers high @-@ quality colours but also several phot@@ ograph@@ ers in which the hardly landscapes are made possible .
&quot; the Ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the shooting repet@@ itions for the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . at large pictures , the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment . &quot;
&quot; digital cameras often have problems with light conditions , and it &apos;s not unusual for you to correct the color @-@ effects of your photos with the tools in the menu of colors . once you are satisfied with the result you can use the button O@@ k and you are used . &quot;
&quot; if you can get a photo from bad light environments , you can get a good choice for brightness / satur@@ ation . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation can reduce the satur@@ ation of satur@@ ation . if that &apos;s the result you can confirm the changes with o@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and simple cand@@ le@@ strength / contrast / Gamma is the tool sound correction for improvement of exposure . even if the dialog appears on this tool very complicated , you need for the field of shooting only the area of shooting . concrete is the three slide below the history program . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph@@ s of int@@ oler@@ ance , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three sliding windows can be found in the inside and to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the control and make sure the picture changes .
&quot; the original and preview of the image can be viewed on the right side . the preview will be dynamic , updated using the settings of the image , updated on the left side , the following options are available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : with this selection box , the hist@@ ogram can be displayed with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y @-@ axis . for pictures of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram of a single pillar is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the linear hist@@ ogram of a single pillar is dominated . &quot;
&quot; three kno@@ bs : the top for the dark tones , the mean for the bright sounds and the lower for the middle tones , often called Gam@@ ma@@ values . &quot;
&quot; the three color pads can be used in preview of the original image , to adjust the input of the shadow , middle and bright sounds automatically . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
&quot; output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two regul@@ ators to change the output . for example , the compression of output can be used , for example , to create a more light picture as background . &quot;
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set on depending on the intensity values of the image .
store and store : these buttons can be stored and re@@ loaded with these buttons and later re@@ charges the Gim@@ p levels format .
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input can be adjusted automatically for all sha@@ dows , medium and sun beds . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette to use and click on the preview of the program for rot@@ or , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the Over@@ bel@@ t@@ ator option controls all color channels to display excessive pixels and show you the combined income of all channels . here it is an indicator , that means you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you see an example of the alignment of the intervention applied to the red , green and blue channel of an photos . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the correct picture ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left , half of the original and the target picture is displayed . the preview can be updated dynamic in dependence on your settings . on the right side , the following options are available : &quot;
Modi@@ fic@@ ere channel : this selection box allows the channel to specify the module specified by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , two symbols have to change between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures featuring a digital camera , the linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , linear mode helps the log@@ arith@@ mic mode . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a short vent@@ ing to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright sounds can be associated with dark bal@@ lot . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos is a red mark to see . if you want to change this mark@@ er on the area you want to change the original value . create a point on this line and move it up to the value after your taste is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; store and store : with these buttons , you can do exactly that . each curve can be generated with this file system and later loaded . the file format is the Gim@@ p short @-@ format . &quot;
&quot; create this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , central and Sundays . enable the colour pi@@ p@@ ette to use and click on the original picture to put the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the check@@ box option controls all color channels to display excessive pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ loaded pixels , you get the combined result . here it is an indicator , that means you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance channel . shadow and Sundays was applied with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) . &quot;
the channel mixer of &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; image editing is a tool to improve color channels or change the color sha@@ des of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can process it from the menu @-@ mixer @-@ mixer to work .
&quot; using the channel optional speaker you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication as you can adjust the relative distribution and rash . the left range of the window shows you a preview . the original can be regarded as opposed to their own riders . &quot;
&quot; the preview of the target picture has a red mark@@ er . if you move to this in the picture , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram appears to show you the corresponding color value . &quot;
&quot; the controls for the module are right below : regulator for Red , Green and Construction allow you to adjust these channels . if you have to activate the corresponding color components , as the channel bl@@ ender is able to reduce your photos to generate great black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color is in the colour channel which does not appear in the same place in color channel and the noise pattern in each channel looks different . if this is the case you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion at first in which you can reduce the far@@ brau@@ schen first . &quot;
&quot; store and store buttons are used exactly on this purposes . for any bl@@ ender adjustment , you can store and then download . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format . &quot;
&quot; the Over@@ bel@@ t@@ ator option controls all color channels to display excessive pixels and show you the combined income of all channels . here it is an indicator , that means you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see a photo in which the blue channel is re @-@ adjusted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is activated . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the painted image below ( 2 ) . &quot;
black / white photography was always intri@@ gu@@ ing because of its abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography is black / white a step @-@ step because color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of movie profiles .
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford H@@ P5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super &quot;
&quot; green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scenarios , and fits especially well to portraits around the sky . so similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter . &quot;
orange @-@ filmed : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Oran@@ filmed . &quot;
red filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a red lenti@@ l filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ eration effects and may sim@@ ulate lun@@ atic effects on the day time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) red filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : creates warm light and medium tones while he adds a bit of cold into the sha@@ kes . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; tool texture apply to use decorative tex@@ tures on a picture .
&quot; adding a texture to your image , regardless of it is a color image or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop kind of an old master , a pop @-@ portrait of an old master . the menu entry for image and image processing can be used . &quot;
&quot; relief : post@@ p@@ one of these parameters to the right increases the angle of the depth , or three @-@ dimensional texture on the image . &quot;
a paper text effect is applied on the picture below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the modified under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief is set to 200 .
with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; tool frame can add a decorative framework to be added to a picture .
the eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a photo is not easy task . an option to keep his attention is to be a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the scatter@@ ing eye . under the frame , the module can be started out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; type : with this parameter , you enter the desired frame type for your image . penet@@ rated the picture with a thin line and a wide range ( ideal for black and white images ) , it gro@@ unded with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame and decor@@ atively adds a ornam@@ ental frame with patterns . &quot;
width : is the width of the frame in percent . the width of the frame is limited by 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; this frame is bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio will have bigger than the original but the same aspect ratio . this is important to print images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can add simple , form@@ at@@ ted text in a picture in any spot . this also goes to several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type text direction , orientation , colour from the colour space and the character set with its features like you need . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . the picture is ready . &quot;
&quot; each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed , until you have stored on the button &quot; OK . &quot; once the picture was stored once , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed . &quot;
with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; tool template can apply you can place a template on a picture .
the menu Picture sten@@ cil apply in image processing can be used to create templates for a picture .
&quot; for the template there is no restrictions concerning the size of the size and orientation . however , you need to add the P@@ NG file format and you should just add an e @-@ mail in english to the &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; mailing list di@@ gi@@ fted users @ k@@ de@@ .org .. &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to put your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder for the sten@@ cils , there is a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil folder . the selection of a file is updated automatically . &quot;
&quot; under the preview of 3 buttons , you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this button increases the underlying image . it is cent@@ ered to the position of mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ ink : this button reduced the underlying image below . it is cent@@ ered to use the position of mouse . if you want to use the template on the whole picture you have to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; post@@ p@@ one : use this button to post@@ p@@ one this button on the template . take the image , and place it in the desired position . &quot;
use OK when you want to apply the template on your image . the image will then be adjusted automatically .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; three different tools are available for sharp@@ ening . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharp@@ ening is a traditional tool for sharp@@ ening . it is very fast and simple , but produces particularly in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures . &quot;
&quot; un@@ sharp@@ ness mask works on the contrast of the edges by a picture . actually , it is not a bit , it is rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it makes a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and he is protected by copyright protected by Win@@ ston Chang . &quot;
&quot; it is perhaps the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its use and has different parameters to adapt . &quot;
&quot; photos without focus as well as most digit@@ ised images need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is also a little bit spo@@ ilt for the resolution , so the same phenomenon can be watching a little bit spo@@ iled . SLR cameras will usually take more dynamic sharp@@ ening as normal cameras for the private user . &quot;
JPEG pictures often have a camera internal sharp@@ ening . images in rough format has to always be sharp@@ ened in the processing .
&quot; some scanner turn a sharp@@ ness filter already during the read of the image . if you dis@@ able this , you get control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get usable results by sharp@@ ening a photo with the sharp@@ ening range of sharp@@ ening . this can be sharp@@ ening with the menu entry . &quot;
&quot; but you should get careful , as the results do not seem very natural : sharp@@ ening the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but enhances also the noise . in general , you can achieve further information on sharp@@ ening of a picture . in general , you can find further information and a comparison of all techniques to sharp@@ ening . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution , the image is a little soft to draw . use the tool to sof@@ ter with the menu entry , and experiment with settings . the front window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter is un@@ sharp m@@ asked is a very good tool to remove mu@@ cus from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview can help edit the image . the front window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values often generate good results and should be tested first . an increase of the radius or amount increases the effect . if you generate the sharp@@ est mask , you will create noise and the impression of gr@@ ate in the vicinity of sharp edges . &quot;
the radius is how many pixels are affected on each side of an edge through the filters . high @-@ resolution images allow bigger radi@@ i . they should therefore use pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ red images added to the original . this will be the strength of the sharp@@ ness .
&quot; the swelling value is a fraction of the maximum RGB values , and the difference amount . you can therefore define a minimum difference thus for a cann@@ on of filters . in this way , areas with a soft change between the tones of shar@@ ks and therefore beauty errors are avoided . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the un@@ sharp m@@ asked filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the revised image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp m@@ asked was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a s@@ well@@ value = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; tool Re@@ focus is focused on a picture through improvement of the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright @-@ protected un@@ f@@ iss@@ ure filter algorithm with Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to hit a picture of &amp; quot ; foc@@ uss@@ ed en@@ listed ; in which it is better approach to sharp@@ ening the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese Fil@@ ing . it is used to focus better results than in@@ sharp m@@ asked . you can launch it from the menu by calling colors Re@@ focus in image processing .
&quot; in practice , the circular f@@ ash works much better than the G@@ auss &apos;s f@@ ission , which leads the mathematical result also by the source pi@@ x@@ ies , which is far off from the original qu@@ ell@@ ent pixel . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese In@@ verse is even very strongly influenced by distant pixels . causing un@@ wanted results . &quot;
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the most important parameters for the use of the module . it is the most important parameters for the use of this module . for most pictures should be the default value 1 good results . but you can set a higher value if your image should be very un@@ sharp but then to Heiligen@@ sch@@ an .
&quot; Cor@@ relation : an increase in correlation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ est effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filters : an increase of noise filters can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values improve from 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 is very bad . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very bad . a high value is the image even further . &quot;
&quot; G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your un@@ sharp@@ ened us@@ p is caused . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts , so you may also increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; mat size : this value determined the size of the transformer @-@ size . an increase in mat size can generate good results , especially if you select big values for the circular edge or the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
store the store and store buttons are used exactly on this purposes . every re @-@ focused parameters that you have set it will be saved for later and can be loaded later .
&quot; try out all accessory , color and intensity activity on the image before you use the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not immediately visible , but later leave un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; if you read pictures and compressed , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , un@@ sharp m@@ asked produces better results than sharp@@ ening . this could be caused by inev@@ it@@ ating a larger neighborhood as sharp@@ ening . &quot;
&quot; theore@@ tically it must always be m@@ asked to create arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never be the effect of the un@@ sharp@@ ness . practical , the result of the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is always at least as good as the un@@ sharp@@ ened mask . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better with the processing of small details . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture , see : &quot;
the original un@@ clear colour picture has to be corrected . this picture has been made with an analog@@ ous camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the Auto focus lens .
&quot; for more information about the methods of sharp@@ ness re@@ ac@@ upun@@ cture in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot;
&quot; the control unit uses the sharp@@ ness of the area of the dark , in order to create a natural pose . &quot;
&quot; the color tin@@ te allows a customized color for pupils . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , you can adjust this here . &quot;
&quot; the tool image error is one of the most developed tools , in order to remove no desired art@@ e@@ facts with unprecedented speed . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ famous algorithm was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France , and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; this tool contains different settings as starting points , in order to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available settings are listed below : &quot;
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the riders and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detailed post@@ ure p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of details . a small value leads to a smooth gl@@ ass@@ le over the image . a value of 0.9 should be preserved , so that no sharp@@ ening should be toler@@ ated . please note that the details will always be ordered . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ ver@@ depen@@ dency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly across all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . in case you will create a high value of optical similar patterns . JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts will be best removed at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smo@@ othing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smo@@ othing factor above all@@ usion p , then the relative smo@@ othing . set this value therefore matching the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is concerned bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed , as it is difficult to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; repet@@ itions : when often the algorithm is run through , there are usually 1 or 2 . &quot;
&quot; &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha has been chosen , there should also be small for a long run@@ time . make sure that small angles can generate a long run@@ time . therefore , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel gl@@ itter and never larger than 2 . &quot;
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more quality you get through the choice of this option is only low . but it doubles the term . we therefore recommend it to allow him .
the buttons save as and store do exactly that . any attitude of image errors can be stored in a text file and later re@@ charged later .
&quot; image error correction is compar@@ atively very fast in work . however , it may take a very long time and draw a high CPU load after them . therefore you can break the calculation at any time with the button demol@@ ition . &quot;
&quot; you can see how photo errors can be corrected using Small Ar@@ te@@ facts . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog@@ ous camera . as you see , there is an independent black arti@@ facts in the fore@@ ground that caused by a bad film storage during the trip ( 1 ) and the correct picture is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce balance . it uses a copyright protected algorithm .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts which come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ ase ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
&quot; if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read these in English in this tut@@ orial . &quot;
the screenshot picture above shows a typical scene with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a grain noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub @-@ window details and the lower @-@ panel advanced settings can remain at default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 41@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for filters . large values increase the filter per pixel and can be administered over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus smaller bugs . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness of sharp@@ ness . this value is set to determine the filter distance from the filter to the front . if it is increased , the adap@@ tive filter image details will no longer be obtained , and if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer be obtained , and del@@ eting or lubric@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , it cannot be removed at a value close to the maximum when you want to lose a weak noise or JPEG arti@@ facts . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend you to change either colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . this settings do not influence the smo@@ othing process due to the details pane .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend you to change either colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . this settings do not influence the smo@@ othing process due to the details pane .
&quot; gamma : controls the g@@ amm@@ ate tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase tolerance values of the dark areas , typically stronger , however , the shadow ranges too . &quot;
&quot; d@@ amping : controls the adjustment of the Ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ ing damp@@ ening . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of the lumin@@ ance . when it is increased , the edges will appear . if it is on his minimum , it can remove noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter in the edges . it can remove noise and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
&quot; store under and store : these buttons are used exactly . all parameters for the noise reduction which you have set , can be stored in the file system and later loaded . &quot;
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected using ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied to the default settings .
&quot; sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution , the image is a little soft to draw , but fortunately you use tool to sof@@ ten with the menu entry with the menu entry . showing the effect on the right side of the dialog it shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ l came ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo art@@ works .
&quot; the restoration process gives you the possibility to remove a lot of un@@ wanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove im@@ p &apos;s noise , film @-@ organ , scrat@@ ches , compres@@ sive , scrat@@ ches , compres@@ sive images , and thereby preser@@ ves the contents as it also makes the human eye . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and tex@@ turing . the text of the text is developed by a different tool , the image error correction was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ í and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a loss of compres@@ sive compression , it creates some compression &amp; quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this attitude should correct these problems . &quot;
&quot; buttons store and store exactly this . each setting of photo rest@@ oring can be stored in a text file , and later re@@ charges . &quot;
&quot; photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and take a high CPU load after you . therefore you can break the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
&quot; in the bottom , you can reduce how a photo with equ@@ it@@ ches can be restored . the module is applied on a black and white photo taken with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film @-@ gra@@ iny on the faces . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see another example for the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were reduced to an old color photo which has been read by a scanner . you can see the scan @-@ arti@@ facts which have been viewed from sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; tools Hot@@ pixel are permitted to remove hot@@ pixel of photos that were equipped with a CCD camera , eight were to be removed . it uses algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are protected by Martin Dick@@ lop . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead , or hot pixels are a problem specially for high @-@ quality raw materials such as many cameras with JPEG compression via a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; &quot; there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wi@@ z@@ ard with the button dark image . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the imag@@ ery .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , you have to record the dark picture directly in connection to discover new hot or light pixels by CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first described , as described in the previous section , you should find the appropriate dark image to the correct picture . note that the assistant will notice the last dark image and re@@ loading this automatically at the next meeting . &quot;
the picture area and preview can help you corrected within the image . the window display shows the output of the film with the current settings . bad pixels are pointed out in all pre@@ st@@ ables areas .
select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixels . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ cut : an average of the neighbouring pixel is determined . the resulting paint is assigned to all defective pixels in block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this will be used separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixel are drawn up to a gap of 1 of pixel block ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ square ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) .
&quot; Kub@@ ic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are moved , to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic bends ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in block . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 and long exposure , applied . the original image was increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the correct picture is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; Vig@@ net@@ animal correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ance , i.e. sub@@ bel@@ ated corners , to correct one image . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lens , especially those in the middle and large photo format , can &apos;t be evenly lit the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ orous en@@ quot ; ( sha@@ dy ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by taking the light to the sensor there . Tel@@ e@@ objective show also this behavior . &quot;
&quot; but he also has dis@@ advantages . many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter which is impossible to keep the camera with hand . wide angle lens should also be used , also with center filter , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , otherwise un@@ sharp@@ ened effects can be created . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter from today &apos;s filters and film scanners , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter in order to sim@@ ulate the transformation with a c@@ enter@@ filter on a picture . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three shelves you can control the Vig@@ net@@ animal correction filter , and with three further the exposure of the target picture . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light ampli@@ fication at the point of the largest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , resulting in a optical intensity of 1 , or random , reduce the density by a larger level of Vig@@ net@@ ance to compens@@ ate it for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; leu@@ ch strength , contrast and gamma settings : the proof of a picture decreases with the Vig@@ net@@ animal correction . you need to re @-@ adjust the exposure of the target picture with these options . the kno@@ bs provide you only positive values , since you must only raise the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a more sensitive re @-@ adjustment of the target picture , so let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; image processing from the menu of paint Gra@@ dation . &quot;
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ animal correction on a picture . the original picture ( 1 ) shows the Vig@@ net@@ ance in the corners and ( 2 ) the correct image is also performed at the image with this tool .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; lenti@@ cular dist@@ ortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion . colour dist@@ ortion cannot be corrected using this tool .
&quot; the coefficient of the second degree is treated with the general geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion of the lens , and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ cave shape of the picture . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient of the third degree has a similar effect effect , but fla@@ wed upon the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient fourth , correc@@ ts away the remote corners to the second degree . if you combine these two geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion is eliminated almost . &quot;
&quot; general : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ ortion second grade . with negative values , tons @-@ shaped dist@@ ortion can be corrected and positive values ho@@ ver@@ ed dist@@ ortion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ ortion fourth grade . this value is stronger in the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners parameters has the converted prec@@ urs@@ or of the parameter . &quot;
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and leads to a correction of first degree . negative values enlarge during positive the image .
&quot; light : this value is adjusted to the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the picture in the corners , while positive values are increasing . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialogue with a preview of dist@@ ortion is illustrated . the values you use for your image will be saved and used at the next start as standard values . &quot;
the m@@ res@@ p or ho@@ ver@@ ty correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . best way to cut this correction as all the first . if you have a picture new and then a tonne @-@ shaped correction would be the effect of the r@@ ong .
&quot; to help you find the best correction to you , this tool provides a vertical and horizontal tool line . move it to an important place , such as the sea level or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . following the connection , you can fix the cargo / ho@@ ver@@ ed dist@@ ortion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you have a ho@@ ver@@ ed dist@@ ortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove these with the cutting tool in the menu and remove from the image editing or the zoom controllers from this dialogue . &quot;
&quot; for most pictures , the tons @-@ shaped correction is enough . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs such as recordings from the front , frame and paintings , it is the perspective to correct any angle in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you have the camera with the hand you will always have a slight dist@@ ortion of perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the en@@ m@@ ating correc@@ ting to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method of sim@@ ulate infrared film , which is easily reachable under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( TM ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ a film , see this URL . this movie has a sensation of sensitivity of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the range for the preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse , you can consider the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
&quot; below the preview , you can adjust two parameters to adjust film @-@ gra@@ dient and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . if you want to sim@@ ulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator is changing the amount of fil@@ ming and domin@@ ance of colour green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in converting . green meadows are white as snow ! &quot;
&quot; since the filter colour channels can be used for re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to use the effect on black / white photos , since the color formations are missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infr@@ a @-@ red fil@@ let on a land photograph from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the working image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was placed on ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of au@@ ra into the head@@ lights .
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; filter fr@@ ame@@ di@@ ers is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film grains , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tri @-@ X . to enhance the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturer of large silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film @-@ gra@@ dient effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ iny especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , so you have to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the control , the ISO sensitivity can be cali@@ br@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although higher values are required , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the film @-@ gra@@ ding effect on a black / white image . the original picture is the ( 1 ) , which worked as ISO @-@ 1600 . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a ur@@ he@@ y legal algorithm created by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and style are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two kno@@ bs to influence this effect . the upper cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five . th@@ icker brushes are better suited for large pictures . smo@@ othing the glass or , from the other side , the hing@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the worked is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and glass .
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dient to create a cab@@ bage can be emphas@@ ized . images whose gra@@ dient are not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful when you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ etch . this would be good pictures to start with it . &quot;
there are two regulator with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper kno@@ b cho@@ oses the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast ( gl@@ ass@@ le ) .
this is an example of the carbon label filter . the original picture ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result is still further improved by adjust@@ ing the intensity value .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; filter engra@@ vings defines your painting in 3 @-@ D as if it was marked in wax . it uses a copyright protected algorithm created by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; Filter engraving is a quick tool to give your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works very well with images with a simple structure in which colour is not the most important content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray and mon@@ dar@@ ken landscape .
&quot; the depth allows the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , is equivalent to 10 % , is the default value . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) is 10 % .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by dist@@ ortion effects . it is used to copyright protected algorith@@ ms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
wave blocks 1 : spl@@ its the image in cells and look it as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : similar to the wav@@ blocks 1 the picture is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects need a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can break this effects at any time with the button .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a artwork using un@@ sharp@@ ness effects . it is used to copyright protected algorith@@ ms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; zoom In@@ sharp@@ ens : im@@ itate the image along along @-@ shaped lines , the un@@ sharp@@ ness of a zo@@ oming camera and creates a dynamic expression of often seen in sports photography . &quot;
radi@@ al un@@ sharp@@ ens : wi@@ pe the picture by turning the pixel by a focal point . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ est of a swi@@ vel camera .
distance sharp@@ ens : wi@@ pes the picture for the effect of a non @-@ focused camera effect . the object seems to be back in the background .
&quot; movement of movement : wi@@ red the picture by horizontal movements of pixel . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photographic , camera . &quot;
&quot; sof@@ ter : wi@@ pe the picture soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ aming and glossy soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour @-@ photos , or add a warm and subtle light . &quot;
sho@@ ot@@ un@@ sharp@@ ens : wi@@ red the picture by random displacement of pixel and sim@@ ulated the sharp@@ ness of a arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
smart Un@@ sharp@@ ens : finds the color in the picture and wi@@ ping them without changing the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo in rectangular cells and then created it , by filling the col@@ t with an average pixel value . &quot;
some effects need a long time to calculate and cause high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the button .
the shelves are a nice little tool to make reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es on your image . this gives it natural your pictures a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected algorithm .
drop size allows to change the size of the dri@@ p . as the dri@@ p size is not automatically decrease with the size of the picture . number changes the number and density of drops . fish stocks change the optical effect of the drop in the picture .
&quot; you can hold on the &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; image processing is free of shelves . use the selection tool to run the area , e.g. a face to remain free . if you then start the filter Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es , the area will remain free of reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es . &quot;
this is an example of the shelves . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the painted image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through sk@@ e@@ wers or dirt into the correct orientation . the tools can be found in the menu , trans@@ forming or trans@@ forming sk@@ e@@ wers . &quot;
photo @-@ blo@@ wn is definitely one of the most developed tools in order to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
&quot; a picture is simple . the big question is , how can you get rid of a picture and get the details sharp ? how can you find the missing information here ? how can you find the missing information here ? how can you see the missing information here ? how can you see the missing information here , and you will see it yourself and you will see it himself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scal@@ able it on the desired size with the tool size . select transformation size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog can be seen below . &quot;
&quot; the tool for change is using a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to increase the pixels . if you want a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to blow . &quot;
&quot; many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ash inter@@ pol@@ ation for larger image . &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you need to tell the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below :
&quot; maintain the aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the input of the new size is the original image aspect . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is concerned bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed , as it is difficult to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ let effect . &quot;
the buttons saving as and store are used exactly . any application for photo can be stored as text file and later re@@ charged later .
&quot; photo flo@@ ats is very fast with what it makes , but it can still take a very long time and take a high CPU load after you . you can break the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
you can see below a sample for photo shooting down by a small color picture on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard enlargement .
&quot; the cutting of a photos is not only a commonly performed surgery , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to form a picture . image editing is simply allowed to create a picture with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and move the rectangle , you will see this rectangle with the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when you get rid of the mouse button , the area of the photos will be cut out . this gives you a good overview of what your photo would like to look like . you can create a new rectangle by turning to the corners of the rectangle . just create a new rectangle with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the enco@@ ders , use the kno@@ b button of the image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file store or file storing in the menu file to save the newly added photo . &quot;
&quot; in the advance area , you can change the size of the rectangle by shifting the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains maintained . &quot;
&quot; in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ size or cross @-@ format . in the high format , the larger value of the height and in the cross @-@ size is assigned . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . that means it is always equal , regardless of whether you are centi@@ meters , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , two buttons are marked by selecting horizont@@ ally horizont@@ ally or vertically . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the dialog you can set with the Max . ratio button to cut the area on the maximum possible , depending on the selected relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool set aside after aspect ratio saves the settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you are using the cutting tool , these settings will be displayed as standard values in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data is reflected in the cut image and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the att@@ itudes for donations will allow help to help themselves , so that you can get your pictures better . these help are : &quot;
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ious particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third el@@ gel is an opportunity to share a rectangle in similar harmon@@ ious triangles .
golden middle : the golden middle is a split into different natural growth pattern such as spiral of a Nauti@@ lus mus@@ sel or the pet@@ als of a sunflower oil . it appears in all possible things to do so nicely .
&quot; the golden pitch is the ir@@ r@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and you &apos;ve been using the old Egyptians and the pyr@@ am@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you come up your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 13 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . from where any number is after 1 equal to the sum of their two . the resulting divi@@ der is as a visual harmon@@ ic . &quot;
the golden middle represents fluid relief lines available if you have a painting . these hel@@ pers are listed below :
&quot; golden Spir@@ al will give you a good result for your photos . compared to third level , the golden spiral creates a liquid line of the eye through the picture . this type of composition runs along the line of spiral and creates a symm@@ etri@@ cal visual flow . &quot;
&quot; another rule are the rec@@ tan@@ gles of golden Spir@@ als , also called gold rec@@ tan@@ gles . it should be something that the eye can be transformed into the centre of composition . that can be a line of its own or different objects . that can be easily done without the eye , it will fulfill his task . &quot;
&quot; the golden triangles also lead from the above golden Spir@@ als . in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles are no equ@@ in@@ ous triangles . diagonal to this lines can be a static object . &quot;
&quot; if you use golden triangles in order to break your frame , create a effect of professional photographer dynamic symm@@ etry . try your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition you can &apos;t reach . &quot;
the Horizont@@ al mirror and vertical mirror show can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic particles .
&quot; with the button color , you can set the colour of the relief lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . on this way you can adapt the colour of the lines to your current image . &quot;
&quot; the Free rotation is a tool to turn a picture , any angle . &quot;
&quot; if you make a photo then it &apos;s easy to keep the camera exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are turned by an angle . you can use this with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; image editing and tool free rotation . select trans@@ forming the target angle , and adjust the target angle . &quot;
&quot; turn your picture with the shooting angle . the values on this slide are specified in degrees . with the button pre@@ ferences you can set the shooting down to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are displayed on the right side . &quot;
&quot; to your help , the module free rotation offers a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter to move the two lines you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you have turned a picture , you will find un@@ wanted tri@@ ang@@ ular holes in the corners . a possibility to repair it is to use the function transformation from the image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the picture is the function automatic . select one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing will smooth@@ es the picture a bit after the rotation . please note the above warning .
all per@@ formers are performed at a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you must use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be re@@ charged automatically . on the right side of the dialog it will find some information which help you to change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed territory .
angle to the top : shows the actual angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed territory .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed territory .
angle to the bottom : shows the actual angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed territory .
&quot; after adjust@@ ing the perspective , the picture becomes a little bit . for individual adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after completing the perspective , you get un@@ happy tri@@ ang@@ ular holes in the corners . an option to ber@@ some of it is the image with transformation cutting from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the setting tool is used to move a part of the picture in one direction and move the other part into the opposite side . this is no rotation , the image will be dist@@ orted . in other words , a rectangle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via trans@@ forming sciss@@ ors . &quot;
sciss@@ ors your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can reset horizont@@ ally and vertically at the same time . if you are on default settings the angle of the target will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target picture are displayed on the right .
&quot; to your help get a vertical and horizontal line . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after which you have performed the shaft , the picture becomes a little bit wi@@ red . for a single life , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two notes accounts twice as much dec@@ ei@@ ving and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
after crossing has the image un@@ nice tri@@ ang@@ ular holes in the corners . an option to remove this is the image with transformation cutting from the image processing .
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write . the available formats are therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way such as these libraries comp@@ ile . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of images with &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted . &quot;
&quot; due to these depen@@ dency on other libraries , it is impossible to specify a list of all available file formats . however , you will always find JPEG and T@@ IF@@ F . &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; only shows files in formats . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of these with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension in the list is listed , you can change the file in the image editing . you can also accept this list of file extensions . in the configuration , you can find further information . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or T@@ IF@@ F . some cameras do even allow you to use the format . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; supports both formats .
image compression is the use of data compression technology to digital images . redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data on a more efficient way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ other results as JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss @-@ free if this is specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the resource @-@ format , you can read by Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Landscape and Cambridge in colour very helpful instructions in English . you can read more information about the use of modules with &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; . &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; supported the store of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is contained in &amp; di@@ gi@@ l . all support cameras can be seen below on the web site of Dave Coff@@ in . see the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; supported : &quot;
many digital cameras support the recording short films . these clips are often stored in the AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG @-@ format . but you don &apos;t understand a film processing program and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities for movies . &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; the &amp; K@@ DE ; can use settings for playback movies to play the program to play .

&quot; &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE programme for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ graph@@ s ; -@@ graph@@ s . graph@@ s are free layout programs . graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with just a few functions . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; project aims to replace these programs through a modern and user @-@ friendly graphic surface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; program . &quot;
&amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; shows graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( such that a change in Graph@@ ene in &amp; Kate ; the graph@@ s are re@@ calculated and in &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; )
&quot; menu to open the graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; to open or open the graph@@ s in &amp; K@@ graphic , in a &amp; Kate ; -@@ component &quot;
download of large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems with approximately 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to show more than that node )
&quot; additional needed software : &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; program , which requires &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools and dot ; for representation of graph@@ s . needed in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window shows the open graph@@ s , each in its own window . at the beginning , if you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ ically , the main window is empty as in the lower screen photo . in this case , the tool contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list Zul@@ u opened files . Click on the first icon to display the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files are selected , the main window looks like in the lower screen photo : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , a overview in the corner will appear if Graph is larger than the character surface . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse bike ( high and down without special buttons , left and right with pressing &amp; Alt ; key ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; when the file has just changed in &amp; k@@ graph , the following window is displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph is to be re@@ loaded , or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; can your decision may also notice that later , you can use your choice later , you can also use the menu option k@@ ins@@ ens@@ viewer ; see also , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you can open a graph@@ s outside of running &amp; c@@ graph@@ s ; file , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; -@@ instance , or to lad@@ ling graph@@ s in a sub@@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the latest option , you can save your choice permanently , but can also change them with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; when the program starts , you can open all the graph@@ s of your last session again . again , you can save your choice as well as later . &quot;
&quot; you can also define how the graph will be split on multiple sites , and the number of horizontal and vertical pages may be freely chosen . &quot;
&quot; if you use multiple sites , you can choose whether the parts of the graph@@ s , which are on a page will be ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out of particular parts of the graph@@ s . &quot;
page @-@ look with one on several sides distributed graphite without head and with another font
&quot; the page once again shop gives the opportunity to determine the behavior when a file has changed on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can specify a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or the program for each time . &quot;
&quot; the page open is the possibility to determine the behaviour of &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; determine if a graph is opened outside a running session . you can specify a standard behaviour for this case ( the graph@@ s in a new window ) or determine that every time is in demand . &quot;
the site seat management gives the possibility to determine the starting behaviour of &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; determine a standard behavior ( the files of the last session or do not ) or determine what to be asked for each start .
&quot; the context menu , usually at one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , further possibilities are opened : &quot;
&quot; here you can choose from different &amp; graphic algorith@@ ms ; entries , as described in the website of &amp; graphical vi@@ z ; are : &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization permits GPS coordinates into the met@@ ad@@ ata of a picture and edit the ge@@ ographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF sample of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a card in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization provides tools available to locate images geograph@@ ically in the spher@@ ical coordin@@ ate system , which is used by GPS and Galileo . height , long@@ itud@@ inal and lat@@ itude are used . &quot;
&quot; to cor@@ relate your pictures with ge@@ ographic data , you need a GPS file as a XML file in the GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and ps@@ one can download the data for you from your GPS device . &quot;
image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can lead a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the pictures you want to cor@@ relate to the main window and call the menu . to see a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you &apos;ll need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . of course , you need to upload a trace file with GP@@ X file , such as the pictures of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when the file is loaded , a automatic correlation is executed in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera @-@ time must be converted with GMT . this can be done with the time zone . place your camera zone here . &quot;
&quot; the adjustment for the maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time . lies the deviation including the data , the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have any trace data from one place for images , you can edit the GP@@ X file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all the pictures in this area . &quot;
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have a suitable data . if you know that in reality a location in a large difference between camera and GPS is , you can put these limits and cor@@ relate to the button . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually using this dialogue . this is useful if you have made a number of photos on the same place . since the dialog can use the coordinates to the next notice , you just need to use the button OK to put the data on the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the loc@@ ation can also be found with the displayed map and be found , and you will win this in the relevant region and you will win this . the card can always be selected manually . the card can always be manually switched between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; complete outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the ex@@ if@@ tool is used to have a stack of pictures with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
&quot; this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select records of the HTML pages to be exported , and specify the parameters for the HTML page . the character set is encoded with UTF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; the module has four hor@@ semen in which the settings can be adjusted . the rider selection permits it to select the albums . you &apos;ll need to select these albums on the right side . with the three buttons on the right side , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area , the album will be displayed on the right side of the HTML page . &quot;
&quot; the rider appearance defines the general look and layout for each page . this rider is largely expl@@ ain@@ able . if you click on a picture a new page is displayed in the picture . otherwise , the picture will be displayed directly with your standard image , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , &quot;
&quot; the riders album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your associated images . select a folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you select the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information is stored in the new pictures even in the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; with other colours , you can change the standard color depth . it also influences the file size . all other settings are expl@@ ain@@ able itself . &quot;
&quot; the rider pre@@ st@@ ills allows you to watch some of the settings from the album riders for the th@@ umb@@ nails , these are small images displayed in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; a progress window indicates the user , how far the action is . press shut@@ down to break the process . &quot;
&quot; if the module has created the pages , the window is not closed automatically . therefore , you can read the message to determine if mistakes can appear at the end of the web browser . press the web browser to close the preview of the gallery . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL based tool to watch images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to watch a selection of pictures and perform basic operations such as tor@@ ques , zo@@ oming or shifting . the viewer can be used with short commands and easy access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture is displayed in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG L@@ oss@@ less module is a tool to change pictures without impact your quality .
&quot; this module allows for the actions listed below , save images in JPEG format , without the usual losses to quality and met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of the los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size increases , as no compression of the color information is taking place , for example , can be found in P@@ NG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ client is a tool that you can connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera company currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these are the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under K@@ DE @-@ Imag@@ ing @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module met@@ ad@@ ata Editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mailing list K@@ DE @-@ Imag@@ ing @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; using the import function of the met@@ ad@@ ata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the file extensions with which you want to copy the target picture , so the image will copy the met@@ ad@@ ata . the data will be copied after you on the button OK . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy anywhere , but not in any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please look at ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a di@@ asch@@ au .
&quot; the m@@ peg @-@ video module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of di@@ asch@@ au . &quot;
all pictures are automatically sc@@ aled on the correct size for the selected video format . additionally you can use a background colour for the di@@ asch@@ au . with this module you can use the formats DVD / 16 CD / SV@@ CD / VCD to your DVD player . you can only use the K@@ 3@@ b Program .
&quot; first you need to be packed into the pictures featuring the MPEG di@@ asch@@ au . after that , you can start the module via Extras m@@ asch@@ au . &quot;
those selected images are then listed below picture files in the portfolio . you can also change sorting order in the pictures or the contents of the list .
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should select the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , XV@@ CD , SV@@ CD and VCD . if you are planning to select the file on a TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre@@ set and most probably choose the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds . the speed of the image process will be specified . a low value generated very sudden , a high contrast , very smooth finish . &quot;
&quot; the background colour can be set as next . in doubt , you should set them black . the name and the path of the created file can be set up under the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file below the name of the audio source file , this is integrated into the film . after all the settings you can start your wishes , you can enjoy yourself quickly or in all the rest of your computer , you can enjoy a coffee when you are back . &quot;
&quot; if a hint appears that co@@ ax or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick packages on the right below . &quot;
&quot; printing assist@@ ent allows you to print multiple pictures on a sheet paper together in standard Photo@@ sizes . this can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is , e.g. , make sense to print or printing the Gim@@ p module for the direct expression . &quot;
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import and convert them in one of three formats JPEG , T@@ IF@@ F or P@@ PM formats . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command @-@ tool d@@ cra@@ w of Dave Coff@@ in . a original quote from Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
&quot; first , select the RA@@ W file to convert and start the module . the Ra@@ w image Converter window appears in mode for a single image . with the button preview , you can look at the effect of your current settings on the image . &quot;
&quot; you can now re @-@ adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings can be used for the White , brightness and red / blue amplifier . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the picture later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected , so you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch does not work any effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are happy with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and the conversion results will be equal to and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a low @-@ loss algorith@@ ms and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the tagged image format , T@@ IF@@ F , ret@@ ains all the information of your picture and uses the loss @-@ free L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you plan to process your images frequently or later you should not use the JPEG format , as it is only allowed to use the JPEG format , since it is only possible to deteri@@ orate the image quality . T@@ IF@@ F and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JPEG als , the met@@ ad@@ ata files are stored in the RA@@ W file in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF information file . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion button . if you want to cancel this process , you can use this process . &quot;
&quot; the pile processing mode allows you to convert different pictures to once . use this mode therefore , if you are safe , e.g. through testing on a single image that are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility of existing file automatically . this is helpful if this is in an earlier try . a preview of progress shows how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all pictures in an album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix to use the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce the image from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce the image of image change :
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the picture is automatically selected , depending on the picture orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . this option remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adapt your image to the screen format .
not proportional : non @-@ proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
&quot; press preparation : prepar@@ es the image for photo printing . the user can set up the printing solution and size of the phot@@ op@@ press . the target picture , includes background size , edge and background colour , is adapted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the more added pictures in advance . more images can go on the list of cap@@ tive images , and lie there . &quot;
&quot; after you started the module , the pictures window with the pictures selected can be displayed . over the button pictures you can add more pictures featuring a file extensions . for the last selected image will be displayed a preview on the right side . &quot;
you can also draw pictures on the picture list and place there by using the list of suitable pictures .
&quot; using the button , remove the selected images from the list of cap@@ tiv@@ ating pictures . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected all pictures , you can open the New message window of your e @-@ mail clients . you have to add here only the addresses and subject to the subject . those selected images are already attached as app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
pay attention to many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of the e @-@ mails . it is possibly a good idea to send emails when you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and used every time until you change them .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you &apos;ll have to specify the right path for your installation . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you have to install the G@@ mail@@ box on your computer before . you can download this here . &quot;
&quot; after the election of comments in a attached file , comments on the images are joined in a text file and added the mail . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best to use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG photos file format , and the original files in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ if@@ data will be added to the associated images . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down with that you can see the status messages when searching for mistakes . your e @-@ mail program is started automatically at the end . with button closure you can handle this window ? en . &quot;
&quot; after starting the Module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions such as you want to have shown . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL @-@ trans@@ itions in the presentation activ@@ ates very elegant imag@@ inations via Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphics card because otherwise the di@@ asch@@ au will be very slow . &quot;
the fil@@ en@@ ame option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images will appear in the left lower corner during the presentation .
&quot; for this , the loop provides that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop . you can then sign them manually with Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; selecting the pictures randomly , the pictures are displayed in a random sequence . so it is not used to order the pictures in the album . &quot;
&quot; under delay between the images , the time gap between the individual images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , you should test this before you show your friends ! &quot;
there are more than a dozen trans@@ itional effects between which you can select . randomly choose between the pictures a different effect .
&quot; during the di@@ asch@@ au , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left side of the screen . move the mouse in this corner around you . &quot;
&quot; with this tool bar you can hold the presentation and start again , stop the previous and the next image and stop the di@@ asch@@ au . &quot;
&quot; at your left , you can see the current data name , the position of the current picture and the entire number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date is still no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under K@@ DE @-@ Imag@@ ing @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. please note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module is a tool to set a picture as background image for the user interface .
&quot; this module sets up the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the lower frame , as the background for your K@@ DE working surface . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have received your pictures and videos with notes , you can see &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; through these brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , now in people , places and in group keywords are present . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window , you can see the categories as you have entered your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to view the folder structure on your hard disk and see the current umb@@ nails . in the following will be described each . &quot;
&quot; if you push the mouse to the entry , the view of the browser is changing . see picture . &quot;
if you select another person only the pictures are displayed on which both persons are visible . by this selection method you can limit the number of images from a few thousand pictures to a few single images .
&quot; if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view the pictures of your action range . &quot;
&quot; in the picture every person has the same symbol in front of its name . you can store with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for every person an own appearance , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories that you have defined . see this picture . &quot;
&quot; to show images next to the name , select the button that you want to use right outside on the tool@@ bar . please note that you can view the view for each category . it has the advantage that you can view the image with images of people and simultaneously a list of keywords ( if you have no suitable images for your words ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you must define what image for each individual person should be displayed . in order to see this , you &apos;ll need to select the picture below for the corresponding person . in the c@@ auti@@ ous window , you can select the picture to your wishes and select what part of the image will be displayed and cut off . &quot;
&quot; if you are searching for entry in the main window , you will display a dialog displayed in the dialog for determining the image properties very similar . this dialog can be seen on the picture once again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string in the field of labelling or description , the description and descriptions of the pictures will be searched after this text . if you want , you can also use a date of the whole date , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all the pictures according to certain names as you can see in the picture . see images on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; this is the user &apos;s manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manu@@ als , but rather like to try functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and look at the quick @-@ up , screen photos and execution videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; download photo album ; and select in the first dialog the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or pick up menu for the menu entry in photo album ; as a result , some sample pictures are loaded and you can test the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual page , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a related HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom edge of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline , see the tim@@ eline , see here : as the name suggests , this surro@@ unds you see data statistics about the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; the time bar can display you several different time units . each strip shows a different unit . you can switch between units , months , weeks , hours , and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by using the LEICA only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be inter@@ actively using in the following ways : you can select the displayed entries of the database ( if you select a date , the tim@@ eline will always show you the current date of the currently shown pictures , when you navigate in the preview section . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a range of time bar by pressing the mouse button and select the mouse over the lin@@ e@@ al of the time , so you can select a section , so you can break the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you two options available to create HTML websites with your images . the one is integrated in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other than module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user &apos;s book is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version described you can create about the menu file HTML ...
&quot; before HTML pages have to be created , you will need to make some settings . these are divided into three areas of content , layout and target . in the following every section is described . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the surplus and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on a photo album ; HTML example pages you see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , choose whether a &amp; k@@ screen album is created ; export file will be created on the review site . nour@@ ishing information about export files you will find in . &quot;
&quot; recently , you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages . thus , you can avoid that information is visible even without description . for example , all pictures of a party are exported . you can &apos;t use this attitude to hide certain images from certain viewing . &quot;
&quot; in this area , you can design@@ ate how the HTML pages are to look like . most of the installation possibilities are clearly , which is not specifically made specifically . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the pictures . this way , those who have to look at your website and own a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 , no pictures to download a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer &apos;s viewer can change the resolution at any time you can change the resolution at any time . so , it can &apos;t get your pictures with low resolution , as well as a lower transmission time , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this installation area , place the various folders and the URL where your site is stored . &quot;
&quot; at best , select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each following sentence . &quot;
&quot; first , you must select the main folder in which all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added to all future pictures . here you can select either a folder or a K@@ DE support protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your pictures , you can check that if you have a URL to choose a URL . if you have created a URL , select the URL which you have created here . otherwise , the URL for the web browser should start this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t have to edit the HTML files in the final target folder you have to manually copy them . thus the import function , see , correctly works , you have to specify the final destination of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; the installation possibilities , which are just described above , have set up all three on the base folder , or UR@@ Ls . in this context , a sub @-@ folders , whose name you set in the output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you may also have a lot of time for viewing the pictures , you need to add an HTML page on the pictures , recording place , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work is not even more . &quot;
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import different into your database . the image characteristics are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im -@@ files , internal and external . they distinguish themselves if the pictures are stored in the file or whether in the file itself can only be a link to pictures . the advantage of all pictures can be stored in the file , but the obvious down@@ side is the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can exp@@ orting a .@@ k@@ im file either from the menu file exp@@ orting ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file is searching for the pictures on two times . first , the images are not found in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . of course , the images of the URL , which you have created using the creation of HTML files , will not only be possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , dialogue for exp@@ orting pictures are described , which you exp@@ orting over the menu file exp@@ orting ... . &quot;
the most important option of this dialogue is whether it is to take internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are the following three options available :
&quot; with the manual option , manual the .@@ k@@ im file , you have to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with the Autom@@ atically option , copy the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; download photo album ; pictures automatically for you . &quot;
.@@ k@@ im -@@ files are normal Zip files . since most pictures have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small but it is normally not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files as if you want to comp@@ ress the export file .
&quot; the last option of this page is maximum size limit . if you send pictures to your friends images , you might want to limit the images maybe not in full size , since the .@@ k@@ im file would be very big because you can say that each picture should be at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you want to import a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file , select &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exp@@ orting database as described in described . &quot;
&quot; the assistant to import consists of four steps . first you need to choose which pictures you want to import , afterwards , in which file the import images should be copied . &quot;
it may be that you &apos;re looking for the category persons of imported file person@@ it ( if you are a sw@@ ans ) while this category is within your database . therefore you will be imported in the third dialog window that will be imported in the third dialog boxes and to which categories are to be imported in your database .
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of imported file with the categories of your current database . an example of this is shown on the image . &quot;
&quot; it must be easy to browse pictures and view : if you see pictures , you want to view images in different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you want to discover pictures of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend , you may want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will see the different steps from the ( 1 ) fixed information about your pictures , via ( 2 ) the search and respect to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program for managing your pictures . however , it has been extended and today your videos also takes care . at many places in this manual will talk about pictures , but frequently also includes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all of its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top file of their pictures . it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , i.e. Normal backup tools , you can backup on a disk or revisions in CV@@ S . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; remember the folder in which your pictures are stored and used for future Star@@ ts automatically . if you want to read another folder in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can start with -@@ c . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
&quot; set up the menu entry settings ; set up ... get to a window , with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of user hand@@ book , you will be explained the various setup possibilities . &quot;
&quot; on the left , you will see six different symbols , with which you can use the preview and options for the viewer . for each setting there is a detailed help to call the F1 key and one click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; it was described as you can set up for any image different features , e.g. persons , places and tags . you can also create your own groups like items , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog box which is used to process existing groups already . for each existing group , you can select a labelling and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ categories were already mentioned in the section . in the dialog options , you can set up complete assembly groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a medi@@ as in a group . &quot;
&quot; you can select the options available to you at the list of members of the members . you can select the category you can configure . in the left window of the window , you can select a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares his module with other graphics applications such as di@@ gi@@ ve@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; K@@ DE ; image Plu@@ gin Interface . you &apos;ll find information on the website of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called via the modules . modules can not be described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most modules have a help page that you can call on the modules themselves .
&quot; since the modules are used together with each other , it can be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . so you should have access to your own pictures with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu help . don &apos;t say , I would not have warned you ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that uses the modules via K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the down@@ side when you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order is not supported , it will be sim@@ ulated for some modules , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; sim@@ ulates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is just the current view , so all images that show you the picture shows . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ Album ; the modules also have a list of albums . here goes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s brows@@ ers the content of a category , for example , all persons , then every entry of this category is an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will be the category you have defined in the installation dialog as a category for virtual albums , so for example , if you use the category persons , you will be selected &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so if you would have chosen persons to view and do this module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules are using &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can remove these from the list of modules . start the installation dialog and select modules in the modules which modules should be loaded . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see an example for a start screen , once you start &amp; k@@ screen album ; start your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see it up a menu and a tool@@ bar . in the section we &apos;ll see no information about your pictures . currently , please click on this window , but now click on the entry photos that shows you an overview of all existing images . &quot;
&quot; one of the main features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the opportunity to see any image with notes on the picture , where the picture was taken , etc . you can set any image either individually or for a larger number of images . if , for example , on all images of Jes@@ per , and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen . &quot;
&quot; all these notes can be used for searching and brows@@ ers , as you can read in the section . if you want to see these notes if you want to use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; in view , you can choose three lists with a text box by typ@@ ing persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you can always use it when you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is the shift of the pictures within the list : if you are shown for example a family party and are shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people are displayed , so you can find out that the used names are moved up to the top that can be found faster . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get a alphabetical list , click on the icon for sorting on the list below . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected notes on each image separately , you might want to edit all selected images and have these pictures with notes . Click in this case simply on the front and back @-@ buttons that are located below the preview of the picture above . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more comfortable to mark all these pictures and to use the menu option multi @-@ point entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as a revision group . to show you , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the interview dialog@@ s it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category . in addition , you can also put an entry into a category to make this entry into a sub@@ category of this entry . note that you just see your categories alpha@@ be@@ tically . see . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the interview , by clicking on the top that make the edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make a private window by using it out of the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the look of the window so on your needs , you can click on the button options ... , which offers you the option to save the current structure and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also complete a frame completely . if you want to get this window later , use the button options ... and then window a / off . this process can be seen in the image . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry pictures in your browser , you will receive an overview of the current pictures , or all pictures if you don &apos;t have a filter . for example , you can see the size of th@@ umb@@ nails , by simply after drag the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it simply . &quot;
&quot; if you make a picture in the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , this image is displayed next . if you have not yet opened a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete pictures in the picture preview . simply select the appropriate pictures from you or select either the remove button or select in the menu Edit , you will see the window that you can see in the picture . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use pictures somewhere without you on your hard disk . in the picture you can see images of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures from the hard disk can be loaded .
&quot; images , where the right corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . this is , for example , see images 1 @-@ 9 . for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , you can view the preview of these pictures . however , you can also view this pictures with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you see , this function requires that you would like to copy files from the folders and copy it again . if you don &apos;t want to avoid trouble @-@ related CD until now , please buy a bigger drive to save all images . &quot;
&quot; in the menu pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to stay a little more privacy , you &apos;ll filter the pictures that you can see for other un@@ accessible and click on current view . alternatively , you can also see all the pictures that you can view your little sister , check everything except for current view . &quot;
&quot; so you have set the pictures in the case of the case . if you give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry , which all pictures you have locked away . if you want to get the pictures again , click on Sper@@ m . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to determine a password , which must be entered into un@@ locking the images . to set this password , simply select password change in the menu privacy . &quot;
&quot; please remember that this picture protection is not sure . you can read all the pictures on the hard drive and to others , the password as un@@ encrypted text can be retri@@ eved or er@@ ase the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only very familiar with the view of private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason you all want to describe your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and hours over hours with it , of course you want to look at some point . for this reason , you can see them at some point . for this reason you can start from the preview , as described in . &quot;
&quot; you can see the viewer you can see . it shows the image , but additional information you have to enter about the picture , such as who is done on the picture , when and where was it made , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ box is on the top part of the image you want to see , so you can also configure which information is displayed and if all these options are displayed on the viewer . all these options are displayed after a right click on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here on the browser , see the matching entries to this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser displays all images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you were selected individuals from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you are loaded several pictures in viewing , you can switch between them and back by using the keys picture high and image . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also available from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when several pictures are loaded in viewing , you can run these as di@@ asch@@ au . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; invites you a new picture after a few seconds . how often a new image can be checked by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key ; S . &quot;
a very useful skill of view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it in full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . just use the input key to switch in full screen mode and back .
&quot; if you use the viewer you can get in the picture and get out zo@@ oming . with the mouse , you can simply move a rectangle . with the minus button , you can return r@@ aus@@ zo@@ oming Die Plus key zoom in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom @-@ rectangle is marked and shows the result of the Zo@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; with the point key , you can reset your zoom , so that the picture is not zo@@ omed . with the it@@ iner@@ ary set the zo@@ oms , so each pixels corresponds to a pixel resolution on the screen . &quot;
note that the only Zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations operate in videos that come in and get out zo@@ oming with the Plus@@ - and Min@@ u@@ st@@ aste .
&quot; with the shooting menu from the context menu , you can turn the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes on the actual picture with the menu point notes from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you look at pictures , you &apos;ll find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to place on the image . at the moment you can open the picture and see configuration dialog of the image to look at the picture and see further pictures to look at . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images on a printer to see images on paper . to see what photos you want to start with pictures and watch them as good or bad , while you &apos;re looking for one after another . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above gives you the view the possibility to view images with tra@@ its , while you can view them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by adding the corresponding letters . in view , you can see a picture when the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have set features on your images , you can see them in your browser . if you have chosen all the pictures you can edit , print or whatever you have selected , so you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you can view the categories in D@@ re Pre@@ view View , then you can easily press the letters by clicking on the picture after the image has been selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you allows you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; click on the picture .
&quot; the old is not stored in the database , but in the database . on the way you can move your old later on . &quot;
&quot; you can see a picture on the painted picture . in order to switch off the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , turn on the picture from the context menu . to get the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ um@@ er ; you need to have the use of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully @-@ proof , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you should have read and understood . &quot;
in the object @-@ tree you can select single objects . then their properties are displayed in the object characteristics and the object in the wire @-@ mod@@ ell@@ - view yellow .
&quot; you can also select multiple objects simultaneously . but not the subject of an object , since all sub@@ objects are already selected by the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object @-@ tree , select the position on which you want to insert and click either to the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu . &quot;
&quot; there are multiple possible positions , this will be the following folding menu , so that you can choose the right position : &quot;
&quot; with delete either from the menu bar under Edit , or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene before . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed features , click on App@@ ly to adopt these changes . if you have invali@@ d values , a message with an error description is displayed . then you can click input errors and dis@@ card the changes with cancellation . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed item with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture or a part of texture , you can see a preview in the Corporate view . &quot;
&quot; press a preview of The Sc@@ ene View and a small example of the scene is rendered with the chosen texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want a lower element ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the whole texture map ) , cross locally . &quot;
the screenshot displays the camera control points . you can drag this control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and it will display a small cross in the wire model . this cross marked the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the location for shifts in the entire window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a wire model , as a wire model . you can only add this value relative to the level of the superior object or absolute value . objects are only displayed if they are selected or their visible level of small or equal to the tool@@ bar of the scene . &quot;
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ ers ; has a window assignment as default . object @-@ tree and view of the object characteristics are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window assignment , or if you need another arrangement , you can adjust it any other window arrangements and change simply between different orders . &quot;
&quot; in order to fix a window on or below one of the view , drag the link to the upper or bottom edge of a view . a rectangle shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the shape to the right or left side of a view . the new view will be an@@ cho@@ red in the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange more views on each other , pull the right in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views of clicking on the map switches above in the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window assignment are pending views : view , which are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . to view a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the link to the desktop , or click on the link to the left above @-@ pointing arrow . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the facade bar . to prevent the link , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can add extra views into the main window . in the menu view , you will find entries for any type of views . new views are woven , you can fix them on any spot . &quot;
the current window view can store you with view window assignment ... save . it will display a dialogue in which you can save the window assignment under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ dering them . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ irus ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to ren@@ dering this program has to be properly installed . when this manual was written , it was &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ et@@ er ; version 1.0 not supported . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ dering the current scene , click the icon Ren@@ dering The Symbol Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or choose the menu entry . &quot;
&quot; a ra@@ cer mode meets the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; it determines the image size and quality of ren@@ dering . if you want to insert a scene in different sizes and quality levels , you can claim any of a fast preview up to full images in high quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the symbol The R@@ ender in the tool@@ bar , or in the menu View R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... choose the following dialog : &quot;
&quot; each ra@@ cer mode has a name . you can enter any name , but sense is a name that can detect the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the box size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to ren@@ dering a small section of the image , select the cross section and give the image cutting into the input fields . &quot;
&quot; the combination of quality you can select the features which uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering , this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection lighting . an exhau@@ sti@@ ve description of the R@@ ender properties you will find in the user &apos;s manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; &quot;
&quot; if a picture is rendered with only a ray of pixels , different errors can arise . these pictures often don &apos;t appear a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details will not be displayed if they are less than a pixel . this effect is called Ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these defects . in general pictures with this feature is better .
&quot; when you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is super sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . the second method is adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sive , because each pixels is always split again and adap@@ tive because each pixels depends on the calculated colour values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tra@@ cing a ray of pixels . if the difference between color values exceeds the specified threshold , then both pixels are calculated by the persecution of a certain number of pixels with super sampling . if you set the depth value on 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated using a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) extra beams per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for Red , Green and Blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for Red , Green and Blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ b 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixel , which can be checked individually and checked further on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the Rec@@ ur@@ sion can be adjusted to the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the Stra@@ it process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch J@@ itter@@ ing , the rays changes to avoid regular patterns to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use light refle@@ x@@ ion ; it takes a very long to calculate a scene with this property . &quot;
&quot; on this map , you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is transparent when the associated R@@ ays have no object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console issue . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason for this . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene , select the menu entry to import ... and select a file in the dialog window . &quot;
currently &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ em@@ akers are currently supported and not the full command @-@ catch of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . when import@@ ing errors or war@@ nings , a dialogue window indicates a list of all messages . &quot;
&quot; if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ scul@@ er ; import , write this source between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End . &quot;
&quot; you can convert objects from the object @-@ tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; to export this text file in the Editor . to import objects into the scene , just mark the source code in the editor and drag it into the object @-@ tree . &quot;
with copying and inser@@ tion in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ ers ; and in your editor you can also add the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ scul@@ er ; a scene is made . usually it is PO@@ V@@ RAY or x @-@ PO@@ V@@ RAY .
&quot; if you click on help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ et@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation on the displayed item . place here the path to your document re@@ ten@@ tion and the version . supported , versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches after external files ( for example height rates ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you enter files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also read the path to these files , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the colour for the control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the colour of the rectangle for the visual field in the camera view and in the Windows type label .
&quot; you can adjust the object @-@ catch of the points on the grid menu of the wire @-@ wire view . you can adjust the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling , and swi@@ vels . &quot;
&quot; larger values indicate a more accurate wire model , making better se@@ wing for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the ball you can set the detailed level for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross high detailed information for extended projections , all wire @-@ model views are further divided when the camera uses an extended projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions to the projections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering . &quot;
&quot; when you cross a wall , a wall is rounded behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you cross ground , a floor below the objects is rounded . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you check edge in English , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method for the ren@@ dering of scenes is set . the values for depth and swelling can be adjusted . more information on the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements . in the section of the window orders , you can create and store window orders . &quot;
the combination of standard window assignment : show all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ scul@@ er ; uses the selected window assignment at the start of the program .
the list of list arrangements displays all existing window arrangements . a new arrangement allows you to add and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
every window code is identified by name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below the names shows all the views of the selected window assignment . new views can be recre@@ ated with the button add and delete selected views with the button .
&quot; the new window position . with new columns you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with cardboard card you will receive a map view back in common with the previous view and web@@ based on the top view , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have just installed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and now you would like to start the exact knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all the steps in this guide , you should make the ultimate simple scene very popular among beginners : a ball on a plane . &quot;
&quot; but you should consider the following warning messages , before you complain about that you can only use a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time you should consider this important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not adjust the camera , no rules for the ren@@ dering are applied , as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; when you insert no light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have any faul@@ t@@ less installed , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ et@@ er ; the following default window assignment : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to get the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . read the documentation , so you can get an appropriate presentation of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will have to use these menus and symbols now often , so you should remember the menus and symbols , and their use . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ scul@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object @-@ tree . mark the scene and then choose the menu arrangement . so you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you create . in particular note that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view@@ point of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ dering of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , see the content of view object characteristics in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you will find further details . &quot;
&quot; change nothing at the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions reserved , but please note that the camera can change in view of the camera , with which you can change the target point of the camera , click on a control point and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; if you push the button users or delete the button , the wire @-@ model views and the object @-@ tree immediately change this settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view@@ point of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you might set a qu@@ ader ( insert final body , qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a continuous method to solve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ scul@@ er ; indeed offers a simpler opportunity . you can use an infinite plane above ground :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and press the button users or the input button . in the object tree , the new name is displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view is now also the level , even at the moment only as a limited time . if you render the scene , the level stretching up to horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you view the object tree precisely , you &apos;ll notice that you can click the item + before the object . in this case , you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object characteristics . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should move to the ground to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , only to get some of these parameters . select shifting and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first choose the floor to hire out its material properties . there are many different materials , but select a little one at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases a dialogue opens in which you can select how the object should be inserted . please select the name in the property view ( name = floor pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button . see how the pig@@ ment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can only have a look of the pig@@ ments , because you have to enter settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , you can always check the colors for the pig@@ ment . also , there are many possibilities now , but take the easiest way . &quot;
&quot; if you look at a preview no color on qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button users and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your picture now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the color names . in the colour list you need to enter two new attributes . in the color @-@ tree you need two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree each time , select the colors in the view of the object characteristics : &quot;
&quot; this step should already be able to execute , as you have already understood the fundamental work of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ ettes . the ball can be just as simple as the ground : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object characteristics you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( don &apos;t forget to press the button on the ground ) , so the ball would ho@@ ver down the floor , since you moved the ground by a unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , the Ren@@ dering is now a strange result : as already before , the ball @-@ surface appears as a sheet of black material . place in the following step a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you select the ball , you can now as@@ sign a material now . as already at the bottom , enter the ball a pig@@ ment as color : &quot;
&quot; select the object , and change the name for example in sphere pig@@ ment . Click on the sphere pig@@ ment , then select single colour and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can gain more interesting effects , when you take time to introduce some finish properties : &quot;
change the values as in the following screen photos and click on users or press input .
&quot; the spl@@ end@@ ment effect and reflection provide some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even when metal is not selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of it , which provides you &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ scul@@ er ; hopefully you &apos;ve already lear@@ nt so much you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ tra@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; if you have a scene ra@@ y@@ tra@@ cker , the Ren@@ derer hyp@@ othe@@ tical radi@@ ance from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera which reflects the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene and how atmospheric effects can be reflected in the scene and like atmospheric effects , such as mist . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will see without a camera without seeing the camera . without a light source , you can also see nothing , the image is simply black . apparently every scene needs to be made , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . PO@@ V@@ RAY files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
&quot; opens a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ scul@@ er ; &quot;
&quot; whenever you can open a new model or create , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest record in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . is it a new file , you need to enter a name and space . &quot;
imagine the scene in the last stored version . all changes since the last store will be rejected .
&quot; this menu entry , you can only then select if you haven &apos;t stored any changes in the scene yet . &quot;
&quot; repeatedly , the order returns . this menu entry is only then select when you use permission to work . &quot;
saves the current window assignment and opens a dialogue in which you can enter a new arrangement or write an existing arrangement .
&quot; in this menu , you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ scul@@ ls ; here you can change the appearance , the keyboard and the default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog for change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change the short commands for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ ers ; change or add new commands .
opens a dialog to the furnishings of tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ ers ; add and remove commands .
&quot; a B@@ ump @-@ Map is an opportunity to make smoking surfaces individually , without any b@@ oul@@ le on the surface individually and to change without the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself . &quot;
it is usual to use the same file both for a B@@ ump @-@ Map and for a texture map .
&quot; basic body are simple geomet@@ ric shapes , which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens of or even hundreds of these basic body . these models will then be processed then to give them a realistic appearance . &quot;
&quot; a texture map is an option to give the surface of an object color on pixel @-@ base , using an image file as color card . &quot;
&quot; the application has a comfortable imag@@ ery and web browser . the application has a browser browser , where you can select images for viewing . &quot;
images can either be displayed in your own window in the size of the picture or image mode .
the use of &amp; cozy show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files you can click with clicking on &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or key return .
&quot; you can adjust whether each image is displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always be using the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first characters of fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field has been found , the file is highlighted by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in dialogue with set @-@ up show ; there are five cart@@ on cards . in three of them , General and editing and slide show , you can set up the work of &amp; ball show ; in the two other , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , can be specified for the respective windows . &quot;
&quot; this is selected , then the pictures are open in full @-@ screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background colour which you can proceed below . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , invites &amp; trade show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still choose the current picture . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show . &quot;
&quot; with this option , it stores &amp; radiator show ; at the end of the last @-@ opened folder . at the next start &amp; open show , this folder in the browser window . &quot;
&quot; click on the colored beams to select a background colour . this is used in order to fill in the background screen in full screen mode . when in the window mode the window is larger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can access &amp; cu@@ ick@@ show , so that only some of the file types are displayed , which can also display the program . &quot;
this option will be extended to big images the display window on the full screen . this option is enabled as default .
determines whether the slide show is scheduled with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; the interval between screen change at a slide show . to change the value , you can use a new value in the input field or use the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of repe@@ ats . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show is repeated long until it is interrupted by the user . to change the value , you can use a new value in the input field or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 1 . &quot;
change the keys for the different business cards of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
&quot; using this option , you can switch between the two @-@ part list of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for files ) and the one @-@ piece list of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays big symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short notice .

&quot; open the input field for completion . enter the first characters of fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show photo ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; photo @-@ based based on the &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; image editing . &amp; show photo ; is part of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted project .
&amp; show photo ; is a fast image editing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to watch your photos and correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; K@@ DE ; is &amp; show photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on that the user reports its part , at least problems and potential improvements . &quot;
&quot; and show photo ; if you are able to report it as easy as possible or possible improvements . wherever you are using this , your browser contains a link to reports of problems and wishes . all required information is completed , and you can simply follow the instructions to give your message . &quot;
&amp; show photo ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means users and developers can help each other . if you want to answer another user of &amp; show photo ; and hopefully you would like to answer any questions of other users . in this mailing list there will be English spoken to this language .
the best start to participate in &amp; show photo ; to participate is it the developer of mail@@ ing@@ list . instruction to enter the developer mail@@ ing@@ list of &amp; show photo ; .
&quot; show photo ; try to give you much control over its operations as possible . there are many options that can change the behavior of &amp; show photo ; change to these settings , you need to set up in eight sides . you can change between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left . &quot;
&quot; in the range of exposure indicators you can select the color , which is displayed if the under@@ - or over@@ l@@ apping disc should be selected in contrast . exposure of color should display a dark colour and over@@ exposure of a dark colour . &quot;
&quot; the main window of &amp; show photo ; features an aspect bar at the right edge , which provides you important information and promotions to the selected images . you can also click this page in which you can click on one of the five riders : &quot;
&quot; hex@@ ag@@ ite , is an application to sc@@ ans of images that do not make more than scan and de@@ fl@@ atter than images . &quot;
&quot; hex@@ ag@@ ite ; it is a simple application to scan and storing images , which do not make more than images and save them in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and files . &quot;
you can check the status of your scanner on the gentle project page by clicking the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org / C@@ GI @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ p@@ l .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; hex@@ ag@@ ite , with the command d@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the Terminal . if this scanner is not specified , or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog is opened to choose the scanner . &quot;
user can select the scanner and select OK to open the scanner . stop and stop the scanner .
further settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; hex@@ ag@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) these options do not treat particularly .
&quot; to insert a picture , the user can only start a qualification and then scan scanning for the final scan . the advance can be started by a preview button . &quot;
&quot; to better select the image , user can zoom into the picture and out of the current selection , it can also set the zoom that the complete preview in the window fits . &quot;
if the image has been selected then the final picture can be read with the scan button .
&quot; if you have a preview of Save a preview in the Settings menu , the picture is displayed in a window window as seen below , then the image is stored and Sch@@ lie ? EN leads to a demol@@ ition and you get into the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the button settings , the same name is opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can look at the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected prior to save a preview . if this preview of the user is not desired , the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows you to select the type such as &amp; channels ; pictures saves to select . dialog for each image will open the dialog in front of each one @-@ sc@@ anned image . if &amp; hex@@ l@@ ite , this automatically opens with a generated name in a previously defined file , you must save saving without a file name . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images stored in the option save without a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the pictures are stored on each scan , then this folder is used as standard for dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change . &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the automatically stored images and is also the proposed name for the image in dialogue to store . the automatically stored picture gets a numer@@ ical Su@@ ff@@ ix of each time , when a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adapt the image quality to store . this value changes also the compression value when saving . if you select the image quality , the default value is used by Q@@ t . &quot;
the button help launches the K@@ DE help with the channels . the button above starts the K@@ DE over -@@ dialog for &amp; hex@@ ag@@ ite ; . the button settings will be used to end the dialog for the Settings and Sh@@ ut .
&quot; hex@@ ag@@ ite ; is licensed under the GP@@ L library and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library , which is used by &amp; channels , under L@@ GP@@ L . attention : lib@@ san@@ e is under the GP@@ L with an exception . &quot;
&quot; &amp; W@@ amar@@ ok ; used as all other programs key@@ chains . below , you can set up a list of these pump@@ kin and their function . select a list of the mouse button in the Player window and select the key keyboard in the Player window , click on the button window and select short commands . &quot;
you may need to create existing multimedia buttons so that they work as &amp; amar@@ ok ; make your keyboard to the &amp; amar@@ ok ; control centre .
&quot; the D@@ COP interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions , which are mostly used in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is designed to describe the D@@ COP functions from collection , context @-@ browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ list browser and scripts . this example will look like this : &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE ; in addition Amar@@ ok still has some own command @-@ sc@@ aling options .
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script , whether all necessary modules are present and utili@@ ze dialog , so that user ID is not running . &quot;
term &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ ult &apos; Res@@ cue ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings V@@ 3.4 is Re@@ quired for this script . &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
&quot; in the folder scripts / Tem@@ plates , you can use a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can simply define it as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand the necessary functions . you will quickly find that the writing of scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
with the help of D@@ COP you can replace your scripts with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should be attached to each K@@ DE installation .
&quot; most scripts allow the result of external programs and commands . for this purpose , d@@ co@@ p &gt; is usually called d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy to be called . here , an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; amar@@ ok ; sends al@@ erts on all running scripts . for this reason , scripts should monitor their default setting and react accordingly to events . of course , a script may ignore the events , if it does not use any use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure . configure the script to display the setup dialog . to store the setup data , the script itself must take care of each script itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok uses the working folder on the folder , where all data should be stored . &quot;
tra@@ ck@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script now could ask &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP functions further information regarding the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the line length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ Men@@ u@@ cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title , Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the play@@ list , when a user @-@ defined menu input can also be used . in order to remove one entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p amar@@ ok script by e@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; amar@@ ok is closed , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do . for example , save data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ oks script management system can also install script packages which can be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which can also be identified with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , thus the user can clearly recognize the archive as the Amar@@ ok script package . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the Extended amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason you should ren@@ ame your script packages right right .
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights : &quot;
&quot; if your script package is ready , you can download it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and link to the Wik@@ i Script side of &amp; amar@@ ok ; you should use the category cat@@ amar@@ ok , scripts . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; K@@ DE ; . &amp; amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is still surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; amar@@ ok ; you can simply pull music into the play@@ list instead of going through endless menus . maybe you can also find a very specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; amar@@ ok ; you &apos;ll find the piece within seconds .
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is exactly the right thing for you . if you are still difficult , choose the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically choose the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Rivers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . you can also use many different audio systems such as you want to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to re@@ experience your music ! &quot;
&quot; typically , you have to enter the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources , to comp@@ ile or install Amar@@ ok : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should comp@@ ile no difficulty . if you encounter problems , please report them in the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; like most applications you can activate or dis@@ able most applications with the configure script or dis@@ able . this is a list of available options .
&quot; for some of the comp@@ ile options , specific depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the system scheme . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates de@@ bug@@ ging icons . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help at the development of &amp; amar@@ ok , you should be full . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort via setup dialog . the setup dialog has several cart@@ on cards to set up the various functions of &amp; amar@@ ok .
&quot; in addition to the play@@ list window , the Player window switches off to the play@@ list . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists window is displayed . &quot;
mood barometer : this function is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok is compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches to the experimental function of the tuning barrier .
&quot; impressive design : this function is only available , when &amp; amar@@ ok is compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . thereby , the used color scheme for the mood barometer is changed . &quot;
tuning files at the music files : this function is only available when &amp; amar@@ ok is compiled . if this setting is activated , .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder by &amp; amar@@ ok ; otherwise the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder by &amp; amar@@ ok . ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / apps / apps / apps / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; amar@@ ok will be started when a browser is needed .
&quot; using other brows@@ ers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list below . &quot;
&quot; play@@ list when loading , store the current play@@ list automatically at the end of &amp; amar@@ ok ; activate this option if you want to lose the current play@@ list when they do not want to lose . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the storage place of the play@@ list , otherwise the absolute position of the music files are stored . &quot;
&quot; the actual piece of piece change is made visible , that the play@@ list window is up / off , to keep the current piece always in the visible window area . &quot;
&quot; when changing the context to the context @-@ browser , automatically displays the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is played . &quot;
in the section appearance you can custom@@ ize &amp; amar@@ ok . the section is divided into three parts .
&quot; in the font section , you can use the use of different writings in &amp; amar@@ ok . otherwise you can select fon@@ ts for the following range : play@@ list window , player window and context @-@ browser . press on selecting ... , so you can choose a font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; using custom @-@ defined color scheme , you even have the qu@@ al of choice and can set up a unique color scheme . use them the default color selection for front and background colour . &quot;
&quot; continue playing at the start , that &amp; amar@@ ok ; after the program start playing the play automatically with the piece , with which it stopped at last stop . &quot;
&quot; the sub @-@ screen on @-@ screen display allows you to set the Swit@@ ching on the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display , a preview of O@@ SD is displayed and you can look at the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
the first option is the font font . Click on selecting ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box sha@@ des that the text is displayed in the O@@ SD .
&quot; you can use your own colors to adapt the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . one click on the color of color opens the dialog to color selection . if desired colours are not enabled , the default &amp; K@@ DE ; colors are used . &quot;
&quot; the input field Display Text illustrates the text displayed in O@@ SD . by type of plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholder and what they mean . &quot;
&quot; the screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users , so you can set on which screen will appear on a multi @-@ way monitor surrounding the O@@ SD . &quot;
the cart@@ on card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the select box . some drivers enable you to activate further applications in this box card .
the map collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folders , the &amp; amar@@ ok ; to search for music files . in order to include a folder to the collection with a file . this section also includes instructions for setting up , as with the selected folders . &quot;
sub @-@ folders : this causes &amp; amar@@ ok ; as well as their sub@@ folders as well as their sub@@ folder according to music .
&quot; monitor changes : enables &amp; amar@@ ok , to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore , an incre@@ mental search will be performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
play@@ lists import : causes that &amp; amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collections folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection will be added later to play@@ lists browser later .
&quot; the part of the collections database is used for selecting a database for the collection . the combination system driver : lets you select between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , another establishment in the sub@@ window is necessary . &quot;
&quot; the MySQL facility is used for setting up the database for &amp; amar@@ ok . under calcul@@ ator : if the computer is entered on which the MySQL database is entered , under which the database is achie@@ vable . name : is the database name to which the connection is established . &quot;
use us@@ ername : and password : to enter the data available to the database .
the mapping card loaded .@@ f@@ m establishes the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of divided pieces into a loaded .@@ f@@ m server and create music @-@ recommendations on the current piece .
&quot; here , enter your us@@ ername and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you have no profile , you can register one on the loaded .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
pre @-@ played pieces and update the profile : this setting enables it &amp; amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your loaded .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar Inter@@ pre@@ ts calls : after activ@@ ating this setting &amp; amar@@ ok ; a list of similar per@@ formers are accessed each . note : you need not a loaded .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . more information can be found in the summary of functions and gallery with screen photos .
&quot; am@@ aro@@ K requires only the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no more K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs ( including the programs contained , because &amp; amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to compiled e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide as you have k@@ deli@@ bs minimal . &quot;
&quot; some functions such as the O@@ SD make sure that your window managers are preparing the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org , for example , Flu@@ x@@ box is preparing trouble . we are trying to support am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these are an excellent development environment . &quot;
&quot; probably one of your files will make an error in the day Li@@ b library for days . you can see this error in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / apps / apps / off@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and hang out the cap@@ tive file that has caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and create the collection again . &quot;
&quot; mostly is that Tag@@ lib in reading the met@@ a information from this file system crashing : please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer , under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
if you use MySQL as a database then try again SQ@@ Lite . the support for it is &amp; amar@@ ok ; is somewhat sophisticated .
&quot; make sure all of &amp; amar@@ ok will be compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , e.g. &amp; amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , this will lead to the editing of met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d then turn off machine . turn off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically at a crash ) . if it is a common crash and send us a good back@@ trace will be fixed .
&quot; this is because many programs write data as UTF @-@ 8 in met@@ a @-@ information , but this does not define as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; -@@ f $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ pd@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ 1,00 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F8 ) ; &quot;
&quot; this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : Mp@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : Mp@@ lib &quot;
&quot; the symbols in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 is still active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bugs in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes you can simply click the status of icons in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can click the status disabled to grey and semi @-@ transparent . please note that in some cases , you can click on a symbol until this setting its effect . &quot;
&quot; if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pixel map , then please check if am@@ aro@@ id is the correct Q@@ t library . this can be found using the ld@@ d &apos; the amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p Q@@ T . &quot;
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ant Q@@ t version , or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to adjust the correct version first . &quot;
there are some options . most installation problems clari@@ fy themselves on the ligh@@ test by the help of an expert your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or developers . please use the forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # amar@@ ok .
bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please wear only a bug if you find something on the error of an error in am@@ aro@@ id itself .
after the launch of &amp; amar@@ ok ; only an empty play@@ list appears . how do music pieces come in ?
this is easy . use the file browser on your left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the play@@ list .
&quot; to keep the surface intuitive , the start @-@ window is transformed into the statistics window . you can find it in ex@@ tras . &quot;
the meaning of this symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for evaluation by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
&quot; to evaluate sections , the play@@ list must be displayed in the play@@ list and select a column list . Click here in the new evaluation column to determine the evaluation for a piece . you can also use the short command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works even if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and press it on your keyboard . or click the right mouse button on your selection and then select from the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; pull a play@@ list file with the mouse in the play@@ list , and let them fall there , just as you would do with other files as it is : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of play@@ list , right next to the add button , you can store the button play@@ list . Click on it . &quot;
probably the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the package X@@ M@@ MS @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; amar@@ ok ; new . look after lib@@ visual that package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations .
&quot; the equ@@ ali@@ zer can be found in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you will find it via the menu bar at ex@@ tras ... &quot;
&quot; yes , that &apos;s true ! none ! &amp; amar@@ ok ; used by the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the actual question is supported by G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ mm / w / K@@ DE@@ mm ? ! how you can see , we can even support text and P@@ NG ! &quot;
&quot; maybe you can use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , where@@ with the default does not use MP3 decoder ( for patented reasons ) . the solution : old @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 K@@ DE , input &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s off : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa ink , the tool has to provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time as well as the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or via the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or via the d@@ mix module for AL@@ SA . &quot;
&quot; the issue of this command should help you search for the problem of problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different S@@ ink ( e.g. oss@@ sink ) . &quot;
&quot; the do@@ cking &amp; amar@@ ok . already . do not forget that media must be de@@ coded first . you can &apos;t just send a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can use directly to AL@@ SA , as well as x@@ ine . &quot;
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound server with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time price ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ ra@@ ra@@ pper su@@ id is set : &quot;
&quot; at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs which can cause gest@@ ed playback . read this error report . the En@@ large Sound Pu@@ ff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help . &quot;
&quot; either do not use the Arts driver , but instead of G@@ spre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia completely to get the fastest Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ code _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; probably you are using the Arts driver . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer at the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less orders react , please help us fix it . &quot;
&quot; g@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the g@@ amer driver , crash@@ es &amp; amar@@ ok . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . do you follow @-@ register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this does not help , you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer too . &quot;
&quot; try this ( quit am@@ aro@@ K before ! ) : - Store download and install it . then guide you register register , once as system administrator and once as your normal user . delete the module file with you @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer config ) and take you register register again . now , start &amp; amar@@ ok . &quot;
please report under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a whole list of suggestions / wishes please send them best to our mailing list : amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

thanks to D@@ COP is that already possible . set in your calendar program an alarm and leave the alarm to this command : d@@ co@@ p amar@@ ok player play
&quot; this command leaves &amp; amar@@ ok . make sure that &amp; amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will be wo@@ ken by the soft tones of music that you have to go before bed@@ time . &quot;
how to experience the current in &amp; amar@@ ok ; ongoing titles when you &apos;re on another computer ?
&quot; when a functional SSH area is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you Inter@@ pre@@ t and title of the current piece : ssh -@@ i ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ RSA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable ername amar@@ ok player , Pl@@ aying &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and Ihr@@ us@@ ername with your user name . this assumes that your identification in the file ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ RSA is present .
&quot; visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; amar@@ ok , press window . press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in size variable window . &quot;
&quot; the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + right mouse button represents a piece in the cli@@ ck@@ row sequence in the queu@@ e . by pressing the input , the first search result will be played and the search is reset . &quot;
&quot; OK , the Player window and the play@@ list have tri@@ ck@@ eted functions , but how does it look with the symbol in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s , click on the title of a browser window . in the context menu , you can select which brows@@ ers are to be displayed . &quot;
&quot; my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS drive . after the launch of am@@ aro@@ K , the collection database can not be created and on the console many error messages appear . what now ? &quot;
&quot; the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; amar@@ ok is not working with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok on a local drive , or use am@@ aro@@ K@@ s MySQL support . &quot;
&quot; put the CD , then click on the menu to play audio CD . it opens up a file browser with multiple folders . you can pick up a file browser with multiple folders , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired target folder in a counter @-@ cross window . instead , take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g . &quot;

&quot; basically this fits the previous evaluation with a decreasing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can insert the evaluation for a piece by clicking with the right mouse button , click into a column @-@ translated into the play@@ list window . then mark the evaluation of a piece into the piece and edit : select or F2 . you can change the evaluation also in the dialog met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
the developers don &apos;t want to give you when you want to publish a stable version of am@@ aro@@ K . this means : K@@ DE packages have not been able to bring together a fixed release plan of am@@ aro@@ id .

&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest versions available . old AL@@ SA versions have caused a lot of sever@@ ing and thus also a lot of error reports . &quot;
probably &amp; amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore the / configure routine does not comp@@ ile this output modules . you need to configure &amp; install and install .
now I have &amp; amar@@ ok ; newly installed but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
&quot; presumably , use a distribution that installed the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , you need to install x@@ ine de@@ vel . then you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel ; then you have to re@@ comp@@ ile and install again . &quot;

&quot; if this is crossed , a small cas@@ est at the bottom edge of the window is displayed . it contains information on the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , and its activities . if this is not covered , the status bar is hat@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; folder view is off or off . folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , the content will also appear in the content view .

&quot; this opens a dialogue window to change the button arrangements for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , after one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key order below . &quot;
&quot; this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup assist@@ ants . so the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs can be set . therefore , system administrator rights are needed , so you have to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . here , the general program settings can be made . almost all the functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialogue is intended to person@@ alize and thought to adjust the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , like many other &amp; K@@ DE ; applications also , with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface well equipped . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions can be used , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are decisive for the function and the kind of task is crucial , which of the included programs will give you . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to ensure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , you must ensure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is started . then enter something like the following : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , all &amp; K@@ DE ; in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts are described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ COP @-@ Interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , provides functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and additional functions for creating new projects . &quot;

&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , one will receive a D@@ COP reference to the newly created project : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project via # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface curr@@ ent@@ Project Through Use this reference is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b features the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface which is applicable only on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :

&quot; this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then add files to the new folder : &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator : is an audio CD ; read for &amp; K@@ DE ; you can easily read audio CD ; s read and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the computer installed on the computer . &quot;
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator : is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and by many co@@ di@@ ers used to code these wav @-@ files ( compressed @-@ free compression ) . more Ko@@ di@@ fier can be added to the program ( if installed ) .
&quot; first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then &quot;
&quot; in a second step , this WAV files ( usually a per title ) compressed to MP@@ 3- or OGG format , or even in other formats like the loss @-@ free F@@ LA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , read the &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre@@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this has to be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , lame ( for MP3 ) , pre @-@ installed ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ og@@ ie ( for OGG ) or other Ko@@ di@@ erer . all these programs are already available for any Linux distri@@ butions , but it is not necessary to comp@@ ile some itself . if F@@ LA@@ C is not used , the installation is not necessary . &quot;
which code / file format should be used ? chapter Wel@@ ter Ko@@ di@@ fier gives a small introduction over Ko@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy of protected audio CD ; s : as already said , use &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used to read the audio CD ; it is not possible to avoid any copy protection . if not the mechanism of copying protection is not possible , you can simply avoid the purchase of copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while the setup can only be done once ( the setup dialog can be found so often up to a suitable configuration ) , after reading a daily handling , it will be explained ( hopefully ) as understanding for the slim approach of user interface , which can be stum@@ bled at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert in many formats - depending on which code programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
can &amp; CD ; get information from Free@@ DB from the Internet or can work completely without a network where everything is recorded manually .
&quot; this is just a short list of commands from the main window . on the page step for step example , you can find further information as this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the program &apos;s configuration . &quot;
&quot; starts the CD@@ DB request of CD data according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB file . ( this may be locally or online , in the latter case you must first be connected to the Internet . ) &quot;
read the read and - if a Encoder has been configured in the settings tab in the setup catalogue - the encoding .
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available encoder , so that the selection with a different encoder can be read as the default settings . it is to be aware that the encoder board tab is configured in the settings dialog . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so a file format will be selected to code instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code . &quot;
&quot; open the setup dialog for the type of al@@ erts ( like logs , p@@ ie@@ p@@ sen ) for programming events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; completed ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main introduc@@ tory dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator , with various box cards ( such as encoder , to setup the En@@ code ) . you must go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
this chapter describes sound quality and compression rates and helps you the right co@@ di@@ ers choice .
&quot; if no audio information should be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is needed . besides F@@ LA@@ C there are also other like &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the down@@ sides are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats that lose information through data compression according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG the most common . OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rate ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but the differences are less important because both co@@ ils produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ nt so &apos; free , lame will still be supplied with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; high up to very high quality ( high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality at lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
OGG - if only music will be heard from one computer or computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playback devices is available .
&quot; MP3 - if music is also heard on other devices such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 , these devices will only support the MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and derived compression rates for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; lame --@@ help &apos; for additional parameters ) :
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency to most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set Standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people and most of the music &apos;s acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for stereo @-@ stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for stereo @-@ stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate approximately 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for stereo @-@ stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and car @-@ stere@@ otypes . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you necessarily have the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information , manually typ@@ ed or by the program automatically collected from Free@@ DB by the program , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can transfer / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; and to the code name , as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
in connection with co @-@ programs there is often a combination of program settings for the Ko@@ di@@ erer and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ern explain the switch for these programs .
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to the key@@ word ( English : day ) add if MP@@ 3@@ s are encoded with lame , the switch -@@ tt from lame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the assistant ) :
&quot; that is what the Free@@ DB is : a free database , in which persons can read the audio CDs you can download , so that all other information can be downloaded from yourself into the calcul@@ ator : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file himself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( address of U@@ e@@ ber@@ aster : that is the author ) I &apos;m not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither can neither the artist can be added to the music business . all information can be done by a Bum@@ ble@@ bee through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; it is active as an address to choose ( sending an address ) . for the use of Free@@ DB can be used in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems , the e @-@ mail address will not be used for retri@@ eving data from server ( This can only know the programmer that has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are in many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator , used by Free@@ DB , the geographical branch will be used on the next level . this saves bandwidth in the network , and compar@@ es the load between the machines . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org offers a current list of mirror servers for online check from &amp; CD ; information about reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly ) only the updates of the database . &quot;
which read program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to store in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used , who wants to be more precise , search in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see to note that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the matching distribution must be installed first if this is not yet . &quot;
&quot; for storing the selected WAV files , the code reader can be selected for the desired file format . for the first opening , pre @-@ defined entries for lame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and F@@ LA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compres@@ sing for audio data ) can be added to the code tab on this tab . &quot;
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the code is used . this is also necessary for pre@@ defined co@@ di@@ erer . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer in chapter Wel@@ ter Ko@@ di@@ erer .
&quot; after installation of a code , further information on its switch will be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -@@ help or lame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &apos; lame &apos; will be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the setup of the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and readers of your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) , try to give both programs with a command line in a terminal . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the shell &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step for step example . even if you use other settings can give this tips how to proceed .
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are still uns@@ afe anything to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ for @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to set those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time and read our first &amp; CD ; read &apos; lame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; using MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 sample filters ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; it must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and lame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for lame can be compiled for example , as it is not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , which you can always do . &quot;
please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you own write permission ( eg ; trying to copy and copy the con@@ sign@@ or something ) .
&quot; the first section deals with the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator , something which is probably only done once and &quot;
the second section describes the approach to read one &amp; CD ; what must be repeated for each ad@@ vert &amp; CD ; to be repeated .
&quot; here we determine the code for compression of the music ( lame ) and audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 up to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; although we can change this settings at any time , we will probably not change them at any read one &amp; CD ; change if once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is handed over to the les@@ bian program to read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
&quot; often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device designation . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
the mapping card general settings . here is not a lot to do . here you can &apos;t let any additional conversion . in our example it will be so bel@@ ed / entered like in the screenshot .
&quot; only if you ask for incomplete information , so you will be informed if data are missing for the testimony of keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
the card @-@ card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are convenient and release the &amp; CD ; data automatically download on the internet from a Free@@ DB machine .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected while reading the &amp; CD ; it can be connected to the free@@ DB server .
&quot; the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately , begins immediately the reading names / fil@@ en@@ ames or day entries , they can easily be changed with the database entry and the ID3 tags can be changed with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; K@@ DE ; tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; in addition to this example , if you want to enter everything manually , then dis@@ able the selection fields and Free@@ DB is not used . however , this is worth 620 MB . however , these two select fields will be selected , at least the first selection fields will be set up on the following cart@@ on card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is Free@@ DB for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from Free@@ DB server via the Internet . how does the system that data will be released ? read the section via Free@@ DB . read all that is illustrated in the screenshot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org , and look after a mirror server in your vicinity . on this track the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will function as the first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both operate as well as the server , as well as many fire@@ walls should boot the protocol 88@@ 80 standard , there is perhaps more happiness with the protocol 80 because the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually is open to surf in the internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we want to transfer no &amp; CD ; data to the Free@@ DB server . the first check box should be able to dis@@ able . &quot;
simply take the settings from the screenshot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; number of simultaneous pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive ? parallel reading and coded ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , so simply try . &quot;
CD ; after reading the last piece : cross the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
&quot; custom files for temporary files : if you cross it , then the path / folders can be specified in which the WAV files can be stored in which the WAV files can be stored in which the WAV files can be stored . if you don &apos;t forget this folder , if you want to do something with WAV files . &quot;
&quot; all so , as it &apos;s on the screenshot . the command is somewhat long , under circumstances must be bl@@ asted to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned before , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; Tags can be deleted when needed . Kid@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; K@@ DE ; in case of later changes of tags ( including full path ) and output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest like in screenshot . some comments for future use outside this sample :
&quot; number of simultaneous WAV files : at a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core , or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to code more than a WAV file simultaneously . &quot;
this is what we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; finished . this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; used . if you have chosen the organis@@ ational structure of your music you will never need to change them again .
&quot; in this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; created on the hard disk . we will create MP3 files . the file structure , the kind as music on the hard disk is described , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from Free@@ DB has to be set up . the process of which is described in this section has to be repeated for each ad@@ joining &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; as we use a &amp; CD ; you are still using Free@@ DB , the screen photos will see a little different than those for a &amp; CD ; you will learn the &amp; CD ; you will learn the &amp; CD , instead of retri@@ eving them from the Internet . comments will show on the differences . &quot;
do not try the &amp; CD ; this sample is to be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this hand@@ book .
&quot; if this is not done yet , now the &amp; CD ; into the drive that has been defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screenshot . this only if the &amp; CD ; identified as audio CD ; could be identified and read from cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this is not happening , then you are looking for questions and answers to the assistance , or go back to the previous section on the fundamental settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully recovered from Free@@ DB , all tracks of the pieces are completed and also the name of the artist and the album are displayed . &quot;
&quot; for the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; there is a window appears , and you can select the database entry , in your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; fits . &quot;
&quot; if you do not select the check box for automatic query from Free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually replace them by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have any local database , you need to connect to the Internet . &quot;
E 1.2 Step 02 : the CD Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Update &apos; to the rest of the data in the &apos; Album &apos; .
&quot; the artist must not be entered into the &apos; Update title &apos; , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ ets , the comment field of the album is used for comments which apply common to all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after successful retri@@ eval of the data from Free@@ DB is the CD @-@ editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor ( e.g. whether all the words with large letters will start or not ... ) , but also to check whether there are any undes@@ ired comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the commentary , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary area . if you have set ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have set up an unlimited field length , at least on the tab tab . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the written files later anytime with the tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all co@@ di@@ ers or file formats . see in the help to the Ko@@ di@@ erer to get more information .
&quot; just select one entry , which apparently coinci@@ de with the style of the per@@ sever@@ ity CD ; this example is not important because we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; data from anyway . for more information , go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read more information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are to be found under Rock . &quot;
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
&quot; the window of the CD editor will be back and you &apos;ll see that the fields for the album is already filled with the selected data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the current piece in each case and other information you want . &quot;
Click on the next line in the main window and procedure in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ; typ@@ ed .
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from Free@@ DB . it is already sorting in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed on the piece list .
&quot; note that there is a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . only the titles are selected to be selected , or make sure all the pieces are selected , or select the button all pieces select the bottom edge of the screen to select all the pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; was started by clicking on the button selection to read the read process , this window appears to confirm . OK , and then we will see a look at the window with entries and track what is going on . &quot;
&quot; on the tab , click on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to control the contracts . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message you see if you are trying to work with a Ko@@ di@@ los@@ ers you have not installed . pieces which were not successfully encoded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the targets are not what we have entered here in the example . do you have checked if you have write access to the folder for temporary files and targets ? ; - ) &quot;
&quot; now it is clear , why the error occurred right after the end of the read of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read and encoding parallel . note the status of the window in the lower part of the window . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that appears is un@@ clear , the number of parallel processes is un@@ clear . the machine used with a am@@ d@@ 64 seems to have no problem at the same time read and code ( of however two different pieces ) . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read out , while another piece is encoded and a third order is encoded within the queu@@ e of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . after the last piece is encoded , a small window with a short time in the upper left part of the window is entered . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator , you will need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.@@ x. or 4.x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG files you need the coefficient of your choice . &quot;
&quot; the package is now called &amp; K@@ DE ; CV@@ S is part of the k@@ ins@@ ist media package . if you &apos;re familiar with CV@@ S , you can already download an anonymous copy . most distri@@ butions are already a pre@@ compiled package . if you read this , you probably have done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to individuals who compiled by source files , and not for users who use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for assistance like the program your needs can be adjusted , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs , has many variations on settings . at best , you can read the step for step example to know the options and settings . it shows also comments for options which are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; hello , still read more ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked up after the first time starting the program , without any solution such as it is leaving no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
what is it ? who reads it ? probably the program has started . it should look something like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no email . the author cannot upgrade this manual . it is as the first version for a manual on &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator . if you want to read it , it &apos;s always something for contact with the author . and if you read this , it has agreed to this section and agree with this suggest@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; strange when you managed to get the source file from the &amp; K@@ DE ; SV@@ N , then you do not need this information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the Mi@@ di@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ ace of &amp; K@@ DE ; in addition to others , he has also not have some qualities with real @-@ time graphic and kar@@ aoke @-@ real @-@ display texts , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI @-@ players did not have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , therefore it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; K@@ DE ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asound project operator , which is supported for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is supported when it supports a sequ@@ en@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; shows the song on the screen with changing colour , so it is easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by raising the pressing keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you are in &amp; K@@ DE ; every MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window can be taken on K@@ mid .
support the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( rec@@ ti@@ lt or text events ) . K@@ mid automatically determines the procedure .
&quot; seat support . if you finish &amp; K@@ DE ; during the play of a song , K@@ mid starts with the same song next time . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can open ... from the menu file . the usual file dialog box , with which you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also run a file from a &amp; kon@@ qu@@ or ; window in the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will also work simultaneously .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and run the button finish in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the menu piece or run the space button . &quot;
&quot; note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts , as soon as you pull it on the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( in several pieces them will be added to a collection and then played one another . ) &quot;
&quot; as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece is playing , you can jump on any spot by using the middle mouse button , and drive with the kno@@ b . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is too fast or slow down , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the speed display . to get back the original speed , double click on the temp@@ o LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space button has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the button break or select the menu entry break in menu piece , so check the playback . get the idle taste while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
song lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use tex@@ ter@@ ti@@ fications and others use lyrics and again other both . some pieces have no text : - )
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust what events are to be presented and even better : the event type is automatically determined that you need nothing manually . if you do not have the option to change the entry automatic text excerpt , you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other kind . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set a event type , select from the menu settings the entries or rec@@ ti@@ fications . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you summar@@ ize . these are based on how you can use collections efficiently .
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find in the menu Collection at the point of organizing .... Click on New and give the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then add the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs like the original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the desired option in the collection manager . &quot;
&quot; in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to no other collection . &quot;
&quot; when using the application , this collection will not be saved . concerns the if you add a lot of pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button . it appears again the file @-@ dialog box , with which you can select the desired song . &quot;
&quot; a second method to add a song , depends on the setup of automation to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when automatic add to the collection is activated , a piece of opening ( using file open or drag &amp; drop ) automatically added to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; adding the automatic collection to the collection , the collection will be activated and emp@@ tied the temporary collection . this collection will then be added to the opening pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and select the desired song and then click on . &quot;
&quot; you can select the sequence in which the songs will be played . if you select the row according to the menu collections of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order , as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add songs or remove or remove random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the select list on the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump on a song , select the Next song , the entry next song from the menu piece or press the arrow right . &quot;
&quot; to jump back a song , select the button previous piece , the entry pre@@ mat@@ ure@@ ly from the menu piece or press the arrow left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the delete collection and click the button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted , however , it doesn &apos;t matter if it is not stored in the release of &amp; k@@ mid ; &quot;
&quot; this is necessarily necessary for syn@@ thesizer , which are not general MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events will be translated into events which understands the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that conver@@ ts all events of Change patch to B@@ right piano in events of the Change Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and therefore always leaves a trumpet if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound@@ card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM @-@ devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so you need to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favorite version ) . &quot;
an MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all necessary conditions for the play of a piece .
&quot; every section must appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is that every appearance has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... End De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... End De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further Key@@ map &quot; ... End De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... End options ... End
&quot; you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for options ) and end , that the end of a section is reached . &quot;
&quot; please send me your map file as an email , so that I in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be used for devices that are not general MIDI compatible . &quot;
&quot; in this section , the patches of General MIDI is displayed on your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows : &quot;
&quot; please note that the left side of the balance sheet is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you cannot change the order and do not leave any line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all the sounds that this instrument is using the number M . if your keyboard does not support a tissue ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , you can do the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; so if now an MIDI file should play a note with Patch 127 ( sub@@ strate ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which , which is sound in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the phrase patch patch of the patch is meant , with which any tone represents another perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one , with which the tone the pitch of the same drum means ( like him possess some keyboards ) . &quot;
&quot; the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to specify , as notes on a specific channel or instrument . the use is : &quot;
&quot; like the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . you need to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define multiple keyboards for each channel and each instrument . you just need to use different names in the first row .
Key@@ maps are mainly used to form tones on the per@@ k@@ ets channel . look at the supplied keyboards as an example .
&quot; this section can be used to convert some channels to others . if you want to convert the first and the second channel , make it simply in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for keyboards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI to channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , constructed according to the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; n is the channel that is depicted on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map is defined on the file name for this channel . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch is always used . &quot;
&quot; the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example , to always use the Per@@ k@@ ite patch on the Per@@ k@@ ite channel . &quot;
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio might be multiplied in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der @-@ events multip@@ lies with the value , this is used with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used , thus in the map file doesn &apos;t dec@@ im@@ als . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed , because GM will present a keyboard that is supposed to play a tone higher with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards generally try to play up to a oct@@ ave higher . to try the correct value on your keyboard , you have to try a little bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , just open the dialog MIDI settings . these can be found in the menu below settings , point MIDI settings &quot;
&quot; the Kan@@ al@@ View is a window with a whole range of voices ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these charges , you can see which sounds are just played . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the can@@ al@@ view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a select list where you can select a instrument . if you have changed a instrument , the button is no longer green but red , to indicate that no more the original instrument is used . &quot;
&quot; the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to indicate the mir@@ r@@ amped tones . the view in the Settings menu below the item Kan@@ al@@ view : settings &quot;
&quot; the speed @-@ LCD displays the speed , which is played with a song . the higher the number , the bigger the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the temp@@ o of a song . if you like to find a song be too fast to follow the text , you can slow down the pace , use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about it , like a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . that can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes on very different ways . &quot;
&quot; well , I cannot force anybody , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
this can happen if you compiled a binary ( rpm , De@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support you need to download and install a source of source ( for example from k@@ mid ; it start ) . &quot;
&quot; I would like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add any files individually . &quot;
&quot; agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . open the folder that you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; in advance , enable auto adding to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can double the arrow key from Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow the playback . to restore the standard temp@@ o you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
&quot; I have on a &amp; K@@ DE ; working area a &amp; kon@@ qu@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop , if I want to play a MIDI file , or I want to play a file , only in the &amp; kon@@ qu@@ or ; window switch and select the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; pull out . &quot;
&quot; if you want to listen only a file quickly , without using them equal to a collection , switch the setting automation to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. you just want to play the first file . so put the setup automation to the collection and then open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains this a MIDI file . &quot;
then you can also join the B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or look the postcard , I will anim@@ ate me on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I &apos;m studying mathematics at the university of Ma@@ an ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I &apos;m not much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to program I program MIDI files , make music and pro@@ positions . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where you can download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you want a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an e @-@ mail : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; you really make me a huge pleasure when you send me a postcard from your place or a Mi@@ di@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . if you want to send a MIDI file , but if you want to contact a MIDI file , but you should contact me when I already have a MIDI file , since I already have a MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; I have &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and from no eman@@ ating the money . so I would therefore emphas@@ ize , because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) . &quot;
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Bü@@ hler - Keep the bug that the pitch is too high at AW@@ E cards .
&quot; my thanks also applies Jose L@@ us Sanchez for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Garcia for testing the AW@@ E support , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ sts , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error message or also only an supporting email . &quot;
&quot; and of course , my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians in the net that gave us this wonderful Mi@@ dian and kar@@ aoke files . &quot;
&quot; in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage , which is located at htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ ut@@ pink / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html , you can find the development of information and pictures with further kar@@ aoke @-@ songs , &amp; etc ; &quot;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer as the sound quality depends on your sound@@ card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or a AW@@ E card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have any sound card , you must comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameters MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ I@@ SU@@ AL . it then runs as if you have a sound card , except that of course you can &apos;t listen to music . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files from M@@ Player or Phon@@ on formats , as well as to playback DVD &apos;s , VCD or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished yet than &amp; K@@ DE ; installed on this computer .

the application window is formed from so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . it is always the window with the play@@ list . and finally there is an information window that is displayed only if the information is in it .
&quot; it is possible to tap the preferred connections under the menu book@@ marks , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries , which should be played after each other , so you should use the category of permanent play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hier@@ arch@@ ical level . if you want a record , his group and all his sub@@ groups copy to the current category and playback starts with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and continuous play@@ list can also be changed through direct editing of XML configuration files . of course you can only do so when &amp; k@@ m@@ player / game can be changed , but also by the application itself . on the click of a sub@@ group only the XML contents of this part is displayed . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you have to select from the menu with play@@ list and select either the processing mode , or select another category . &quot;
&quot; all changes are lost if the processing mode , or another group is selected , without the play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; following the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation when starting and end can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; General Op@@ tions &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 &apos; option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be easily inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to enable other animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will be aware of the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / k@@ m@@ player / share / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps /
&quot; the animation at Star@@ ts doesn &apos;t need to be short , it will be automatically terminated by opening another source . however , this would end with the end @-@ animation , however , the user can finish the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be displaying a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / / / home ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / / / home ; &amp; lt ; / / / home ; / body@@ board ; supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; in the directory tests / several examples of S@@ MIL which are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a Rider on Con@@ figuration of M@@ Player in Con@@ figuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here you can set the path from the player and the cache size from the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ bles@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the issue of m@@ player .
&quot; there is no rider for this r@@ end@@ ition in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player , . everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ c . here is an example of such a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa : &quot;
&quot; Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player , and can even be inserted the special field Em@@ bed for YouTube in the play@@ list XML . &quot;
&quot; with that the &amp; k@@ m@@ player , &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as service providers for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file extensions of K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player , is in a consoles of application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . if no error occur , the back@@ end output is within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; this is always a given back@@ end for a certain M@@ ime type ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this has to be done by manual change of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , ph@@ on should play all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play from TV cards to play either by M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be viewed , the scanner is used to use the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video data recorder ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player , the dialog can be used in the settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be used to be used ( e.g. , it is PAL for Western Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DVB in it . &quot;
&quot; as the V@@ DR support for k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ Video ( probably this kind of playback of video devices can also work on Linux ) . this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux enlar@@ ges extend for the X server . therefore , the video server must therefore contain the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; internally used by KM@@ Player for the sources used different names . at the time of the creation of this documentation , d@@ v@@ d@@ nav@@ source , d@@ v@@ d@@ dy , t@@ v@@ scanners , t@@ v@@ scanners , t@@ v@@ p source , source resource , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they begin with the play@@ list of play@@ list . &quot;
is there indications how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the VCD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / c@@ drom is as a user root after the insert of the device . it &apos;s definitely sure that / dev / c@@ drom indicates the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and will be used to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ ile ;
lat@@ ex ; : a professional correspondence application . among Unix @-@ such systems probably will be back on the package &amp; tex@@ as ; and / or similar ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the &amp; Linux ; distribution distribution . for the installation the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project includes some compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without comp@@ iling and are included on the k@@ ile ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - independent of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; K@@ DE ; , &amp; c@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation should be considered . is the support for this project or its documentation should be made contact via the k@@ ile ; web page . &quot;
ask questions or complic@@ it by comp@@ iling &amp; c@@ ile ; it should be requested to be addressed to the mailing list of c@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; K@@ DE ; application area . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphic surface and setting tools for this . in conclusion , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the mighty project management . &quot;
&quot; to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and his ways to learn the manual of Kate . users from &amp; k@@ ile , can begin there directly with reading the chapter of Works with the editor of &amp; Kate ; start there . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; lat@@ ex ; the right language : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . is the right choice : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . it is difficult to use , also a lift ( in English ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can also be used as a few challenging but more realistic view . &quot;
&quot; here is not the ultimate book to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book . for example , H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Us@@ ers , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r . &quot;
&quot; just like other recording languages includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction , with which the gener@@ alized characteristics such as paper format , side@@ walks and text ratings will be specified as well as a kitchen with the command \ \ . &quot; { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ \ &quot; { document } . &quot; &quot;
the fast @-@ entry assistant to &amp; k@@ ile ; is a recent function for the fast creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; . the selection of the assist@@ ants ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) provides some of the possibilities for the creation of the document . it can also be done some on the document related settings .
&quot; document categories : this will be the type of document identi@@ fier : article ( article ) , book &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , fo@@ ils &#91; pro@@ sp@@ it &#93; or custom . &quot;
encoding : this will be used with the character encoding . modern systems use UTF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . if necessary , UTF @-@ 8x should be used ( at correct processing the &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) . &quot;
&quot; this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for binding , they can only be cut down in the cross field . &quot;
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the Docum@@ ent@@ classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) should always be used in creating German texts . &quot;
new users are now not worried . only a brief description of the functions and further information are given in the section .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers - the same as other source code editor - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; k@@ ile ; it is a simple problem to look for some mathematical environment . however , it is characterized by the modest appearance of output file . however , it is due to you by the her@@ ent time and more powerful . &quot;
&quot; with the automatic adjustment of the environments , in terms of a new command ( e.g. \ \ , { command } ) by &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically creates a blank line ( for input the text ) and the following line to close the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be activated in the menu settings ; La@@ Te@@ X commands de@@ activated . &quot;
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; encour@@ ages the sub@@ division of the document in the following elements ( part is the most beautiful and sub@@ woo@@ ded element ) :
&quot; with the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed through a mouse click on the respective display and viewed . &quot;
&quot; when creating the own &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ files can be created very helpful , as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; framed file in the DVI ; -@@ Viewer for the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code . &quot;
a DVI @-@ file contains a description of the form@@ at@@ ted document and other information such as the font and also other information including the font type &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools to view , convert and to print DVI ; -@@ files for various systems and barley . &quot;
&quot; for using the slip case , the elements of DVI ; file is cli@@ cked with the editor PFT and as soon as a item in the DVI @-@ file . as soon as a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is cli@@ cked , the exact opposite section is found in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is spec@@ kled in DVI . &quot;
&quot; Master @-@ Document : this function is used in work with multiple files . using a master document , the work with other integrated .@@ tex files will be simplified . when using a project a project @-@ wide master document can be submitted to project settings . &quot;
quick @-@ scale : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result will be displayed automatically ( if no error occurred in the source code ) .
&quot; file extension : in this mode , the DVI @-@ file will be on top of the above @-@ section , and there is no appeal by &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; following the quick @-@ track . &quot;
&quot; considering the work@@ load tool@@ bar , the three large selection units should be loaded into the document . the first selection field is for the rapid breakdown of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The ver@@ itable &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for the sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the radio box for further information is available for articles such as , tags , notes , notes , or references . these options are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command a name is created for a section , a picture or different element . &quot;
reference : is used for reference to a fixed name ( select a selection box ) .
when using quote is a select list with literary entries . at &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; this only works if the file is needed for a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; and the author has written good experiences in &amp; k@@ ile ; hand @-@ written by hand .
&quot; the last selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¨ res will be used for the definition of the font . it can be set to the main text , which are defined as notes , etc . , there are the following font into consideration : &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; k@@ ile ; there are two options to apply : 1 . the assistant for the creation of a new document is written by selecting the document art and festiv@@ ities of settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand , by hand . &quot;
&quot; the bra@@ ckets in accordance with the command \ \ . class class contain the settings for the command . the character &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; puts the font into the font . if the font is not set at the beginning , this can also happen in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source code was entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text has to be compiled . the easiest way to this is the use of the menu building or the button of quick . &quot;
the source code must be saved prior to comp@@ iling . &amp; c@@ ile ; for storing the storage automatically .
&quot; apply the comp@@ iling of the document , should be searched for errors after errors . when using quick construction , &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; it is not the case , the log@@ ging should also be considered . &quot;
&quot; an area ( English @-@ environment ) is a text that is treated differently than the remaining document . for example , a report with the font contains 12 and only a few south can have a different font . the command \ \ &apos; { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } encour@@ ages the top of the font to be found within the area . &quot; &quot; Ries@@ ig@@ â s &quot; &quot; ( English Hu@@ ge ) . &quot;
&quot; the entries will only be supervised within the area ( from \ \ , { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for the possibility within a environment . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to illumin@@ ate the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , grease pressure , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ strate , etc . these commands are either added with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; \ \ 2018 { emp@@ t } : this command is for cur@@ sive pressure and is long as long as long as it is closed , until it is closed with a \ \ end { feeling } or another environment . a single word in a set can be illustrated with \ \ emp@@ h { word } . &quot;
\ \ Qu@@ ote : created a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ March { quota } and ends with \ \ end { quota } .
&quot; after the background to write the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; label language , a step @-@ for @-@ step instructions will follow suit for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; &quot;
&quot; as soon as the assist@@ ants was entered a bit of text , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be accomplished . to this , min@@ d. a quote , some places in fat and cur@@ sive pressure and a poem are to be seen in order to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , an editor @-@ view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be turned back to editor at an external viewer . an external viewer must be closed on an external viewer . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI @-@ file has been created , the document can be printed or entered into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . easy to try and have fun . &quot;
DVI . this files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of the .d@@ vi issue like printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF @-@ converting or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for creating a document ( see ) . the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , then the document can be printed ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of DVI ; file into other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text has been created , the conversion to all other formats can start in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; the preferred editor encour@@ ages the direct leap from the editor to the additional position within the DVI , file . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; binary files . to this one only need to set Modern on Settings ... tool@@ bar .
&quot; for searching for the priv@@ ilege , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a row of the source codes and close on anticip@@ ation . the jump to the corresponding location in DVI ; -@@ Viewer is then done . &quot;
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; button with one click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; file by &amp; k@@ ile ; open and relevant lines . to this must be set &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; used as text editor ( Settings ... editor )
&quot; when using quick construction of the &amp; DVI ; viewer can not appear , an error can be prec@@ eded . if a bug is pre@@ ten@@ dered , this is displayed in the protocol file or in the news window . &quot;
&quot; the protocol file enlighten@@ ed the source source in the source code . in the editor , the log file will always appear on the error , in which the error appears . to look the error in the error , and c@@ ile ; jumps to the faulty line . &quot;
&quot; once the button is cli@@ cked on the button in the tool@@ bar , a window to choose from the available template will appear for the document . the default settings are : &quot;
&quot; with a selection of empty document , a document may either be written on new or the assistant to a quick preparation of a new document . more information can be found in the section . &quot;
&quot; users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , stored in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either a existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file size or a new file will be created . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template through an existing document and selection of file template from document ... create . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template by file New , some character strings replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in settings ... &quot;
&quot; in creating the own template , it is necessary to know which character strings of which variables will be replaced : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLAS@@ SO@@ PT@@ ION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the documentation class . typically they are used as follows : \ \ . class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLAS@@ SO@@ PT@@ ION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } .
&quot; the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wi@@ z@@ ard , and the application of the commands in the editor . once the document created the following steps : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , your own template can be selected instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; file files . a simple way to create a template , should be searched after one in the internet and can be folded under the steps below . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers and Her@@ acles of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; ) .
&quot; to learn more about it and Kate ; and his mom should learn the manual at Kate . users from &amp; k@@ ile , do you know there directly with reading the chapter of Work with the editor of &amp; Kate ; begin . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command re@@ ference , which can be accessed by the La@@ Te@@ X reference for the menu , which can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use as well as their syntax . &quot;
double @-@ click with a double string key to check the &amp; tex ; this means that on this way , when clicking on \ \ par \ \ &apos; par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p click here . &quot;
&quot; when pulling the text , the text of the text is copied automatically into the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys , the arrow keys can be fitted in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; has the ability to browse the different types of source codes to browse and produce them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands from the normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ul@@ as are highlighted by another colour . &quot;
&quot; many assist@@ ants are added . this is a unique type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu processing or the corresponding key stamp is emphas@@ ized to jump the jump , or the corresponding key stamp , so that it is automatically deleted at the first input of a character . &quot;
&quot; the work is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; although &amp; Kate ; already excellent mix@@ tures were added , &amp; lat@@ ex ; important functions for the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source codes for their selection . among constra@@ ints are the following commands to include the text excerpt : &quot;
a complete paragraph from ( group of lines which contain an empty line ) with a section is meant to be an empty line . this extended meaning can be added to the tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source codes . the only preventive thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the exception of two empty lines are separated . &quot;
&quot; the word below the current cur@@ sor position . this selection has also a extended meaning , since this command is also &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a huge cut ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) . &quot;
&quot; a part of a part of the document can be removed , and by pressing the button . &amp; Kate ; offers the key line C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the following commands to remove the text of the text : &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a section in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description to work outside paragraph .
it has already been pointed out that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for further commands under Edit environment for one m@@ ute simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
&quot; with this command will be applied to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to the top of the environment . &quot;
&quot; with this command will be applied to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the surroundings . &quot;
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is placed before or within the command \ \ . } { surroundings } , the end of the surrounding area is spec@@ kled ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many swallowed ambient commands , you can quickly lose sight . this command close the most recent environment , so that the environment structure is not dist@@ orted . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offer special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by bra@@ ckets { ... } . among Be@@ en Te@@ X Group are a few important commands that meet those from work environments .
&quot; with this command , at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the welded cl@@ amp . &quot;
&quot; with this command , at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the welded cl@@ amp . &quot;
&quot; if the cur@@ sor before or behind the welded cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; group # is , is used to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; during the entry of many sho@@ cked groups @-@ bra@@ ckets can be lost quickly . this command close the most recent group , so that the pil@@ ed structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be dist@@ orted . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two basic configuration is used as G@@ Ã ¤ n@@ se@@ wing characters . for this purpose the purpose is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; &quot; will be used for two easy beginners . &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; also knows this case and take two complete assembly mark for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one . &quot;
this automatic inser@@ tion of the double beginnings can be set up under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X - and be sign@@ posted .
&quot; it can also be used with specific settings ( e.g. , or French ) and German or French beginners . there are also many other languages available . &quot;
&quot; when shifting from Shift ; input key , it is a smart c@@ eil@@ ing interru@@ ption . if the current position is within a lists -@@ environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , but at the same time the command \ \ item is at the same time . &quot;
&quot; within a file area close t &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intellig@@ ently enough to under@@ line vo@@ iced &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments to under@@ line them . this can be added to the La@@ Te@@ X .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables and all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . if this tab is to be encouraged in the subsequent table . although this table does not want to add the item for the columns out of the current tab@@ s .
&quot; although &amp; Kate ; already a good source code has been installed , these are built in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special orders ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) . these are suitable for automatic adjustment of these modes . all of these modes are set up for different work services under att@@ ach@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; when setting up a new area by the command \ \ , { surroundings } is &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically added the command \ \ end { surroundings } after an empty row ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; during the check box , the last character of the input will be removed and you would like to get the complete list . on the other hand , the list can be reduced by adding another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions of the descriptions are fitted with a selection of a command . alternatively , jump from &amp; k@@ ile ; also jumps on these positions can be infl@@ ated and the desired parameters can be frozen . &quot;
&quot; under settings c@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; complete settings on these lists can be made . it can be different to choose among these lists ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands , as well as we@@ aries of the general language used . &quot;
&quot; command mode is not recommended for the cancellation of environments . there are always a few letters to be entered with \ \ 1 . on the other hand , the environments will be used with environmental commands . on the other hand , environments will be used as often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the compensation of environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling for the complete reference mode , the menu is checked automatically and the key button is checked automatically , and it appears to be on the easiest way to be done ( \ \ ) . after that , the ambient can be continued on the sim@@ pl@@ est way and can be stopped by pressing the entry . &quot;
&quot; after this is accomplished , the environment will be closed automatically . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recognizes that it is a lot of lists , even a first \ \ item command is being folded . &quot;
&quot; att@@ ach@@ able settings ; set up ... k@@ ile ; complete settings on these lists . this mode uses the ful@@ fil@@ ment list of the complete reference mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; support the customized lists of ab@@ dic@@ tive labels , which are immediately replaced by default character strings . for example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ ab , for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L has been entered and the word has been introduced , for example , the letter L is entered , the letter L will be replaced by the character \ \ La@@ Te@@ X character string . &quot;
&quot; large , great events are not helpful . however , many whales have been written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; k@@ ile ; the ful@@ fil@@ ment has already been written in one document . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the menu settings ... K@@ ile compar@@ is@@ ons . here , too , the swelling can also be specified for the ad placement . &quot;
&quot; the complete native files can be installed in the sub file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / etc . &quot;
&quot; the dialog graphics will be designed , as simple as possible . for the introduction of the basics on the graphic formats , the sections should be considered and considered . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not so known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for app@@ rais@@ als and new orders of pages . the PDF edition is fully arranged , so the pages are arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools can be re@@ arranged and then ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; in order to view the results of the work , the source code must be compiled . all building tools are group@@ ed into the menu creating comp@@ iling , creating converting and creating view . &quot;
&quot; for the comp@@ iling of the source code for viewing such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or another conversion can be used by using old ; 3 viewed , by Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file into a PS file , and by Alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed . &quot;
&quot; when using the command speed , a viewer is usually called after the comp@@ iling . should not be used in a bound viewer , so it will be a new window . &quot;
a new project will be added to the new project .... Hier@@ in the following information will be asked for the project :
when selecting the fil@@ en@@ ame window the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the output of EC@@ MAS@@ TER -@@ code . the scripts can be managed in vertical l@@ acks .
the API scripts are not yet developed and can be seen in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile ; even more .
&quot; first , the first needs to be said that the identification environment of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = k@@ ile ) has the following methods : &quot;
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a right @-@ defined system that can be expanded with a wide range of additional packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; provides a lot of different help to under@@ wear the user .
&amp; Ear@@ ex ; and &amp; Tex@@ live ; supplied with many documents . it includes a documentation for the packages contained in the packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
&quot; a complete Re@@ fern@@ z for &amp; tex ; and his e@@ â s of Fre@@ in@@ de@@ â s . it is not only a description of all programs ( but some important packages are described ) but rather , it is ideal for searching for a particular form@@ att@@ ing . since it is a very large document that is divided into three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; because of the amount of documents with which &amp; similar ; / tex@@ as ; delivered , it is not always easy ; / tex@@ as ; the small application tex@@ tual , which contains a database with all on &amp; k@@ ile ; supplied documents and this for a graphical kind of graphic data . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the ideal advantage is the search for par@@ cel names or impact drivers . then only the results will be displayed .
double @-@ click with the mouse or the bed of the space taste the viewer for the document .

&quot; version 3.2 of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; all these tools use comp@@ resses as a surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination makes fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; everyone , who has worked with the &amp; K@@ DE ; we thought it &apos;s still a piece . if we need it a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no more on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked the symbol for the XML processor and ready ! &quot;
&quot; this application expects a inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is on the desired work folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the current working folder and give them the desired folder in the field of other folder . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted each time when supposed to be started .
&quot; as already mentioned , everyone who has worked at the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentary already worked , how helpful this application is . and with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface . &quot;
&quot; if the straight open file is inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book , then you can simply select the current working folder . if not , then choose the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is available . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to a issue on screen , your file is fla@@ wed . please check the reported mistakes and try again . &quot;
&quot; the file is already marked in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; then , the current file is easily accessed . if not , delete it into current file the skins and select the file &apos;s checking file using other file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if they only want to know if the file is well @-@ formed , they click the well @-@ to check selection . &quot;
&quot; for use of a &amp; D@@ TD ; specified in the &amp; XML file ; file selection for the &amp; D@@ TD ; ( internal ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( external ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; Schem@@ atic options as well as the Rel@@ ax@@ NG review is the indication of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection required . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; should the processing file in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus should be selected , then the current file should be selected . if not , remove the file current file and select the file to be processed using the other file file selection . &quot;
&quot; enter the file name , as the result is supposed to be named . the file is usually stored in their home folder . &quot;
&quot; plug@@ ins , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , have too little to do with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; even better to do this . you can &apos;t wait from the extra functionality and do not wait until someone can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be found below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug@@ in or a part , we begin with the menu plug@@ ins . so the following dialog starts : &quot;
this dialogue allows you to manage all contained plug@@ ins and adding new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; ELE@@ MENT @-@ ELE@@ MENT :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a storage place &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to searching the plug @-@ in .
often working on a project several people work in a type of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties project properties .
the name and email entries are self explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves for unique identi@@ fying .
one member can have several roles in the project such as Team@@ leaders as well as Sub@@ project Director .
the user can look for yourself from the list of te@@ amm@@ ates who he is . this is done by searching the team member of the list and expresses the S@@ etze button . the current selected member ( its identi@@ fier ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ name and setting of their own identity are important regarding news and notes . see for further information about comments .
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage by the acquisition of the members of the team : it can be created an event for information on the team manager if something happens . see for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something specific in the project is done . an example would be the drawing of opening and closing of the project , as much someone has worked on , or the sending of a message when a file is secured , or a script that will add a file into CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project , etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
&quot; an email will be sent to the mailing list selected in the recipient . the address can be a team or Sub@@ project leader . see , we@@ i such a ladder can be set up . &quot;
remarks are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
notes is simple . it may be selected either the note -@@ entry from the editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary volume followed by comment text .
&quot; notes can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , the nick@@ name of the project Manager Sub@@ project leaders should be given a role in the project of the following possibilities : team leader Sub@@ project Head In the Area and Sub@@ project leaders should be given the corresponding range or Sub@@ project leaders , as in the following examples below . &quot;
nick@@ name and roles names are independent of large or small @-@ sensitive but spaces around the bra@@ ckets and the note : make the note invali@@ d .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for script and form@@ att@@ ing languages that supports D@@ TD @-@ ag@@ no@@ stic and web@@ based form@@ att@@ ing and scripts .
&quot; the settings are achie@@ vable via the Settings menu . only about &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , specific settings will be treated , a short description for the others can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up by the Quant@@ um Settings ... you can be called . this dialog covers some sites that will be treated after each other .
the behaviour of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car complet@@ es can be changed . the entries are :
&quot; tags : large / small in@@ qu@@ elling of tags : large / low @-@ sensitive tags , which means that tags are inserted as inserted in the tag files , as described in the day XML files . &quot;
&quot; attribute of attributes : large / small copy of attributes : large / low @-@ sensitive attributes , the attributes will be inserted so inserted as they are described in the daily XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically include : when attached , is optional for tags , for which the final day is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
&quot; not optional tags : like above , except for all other tags , except for simple tags . &quot;
&quot; start and end day automatically update : when switched on , the appropriate day will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic detection of accent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acute characters in the corresponding coding during enem@@ a .
M@@ IM@@ E types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es to detect different types of files . using the default button the default enco@@ res can be restored .
standard coding : encoding the code of newly created or in other way as a file open files ( where the coding of the file can be negotiated ) . but this setting is used by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not recognized . but this setting is used by the same in the project characteristics , if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regular backup copy , so that for a blackout or crash when the next start of the program can restore the document from this backup . this is not the same as save the file . additionally , it is not the same as save the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor or own view ( or documentation in a cardboard box ) , which makes it possible to watch the documentary , the preview and the source code at the same time . &quot;
&quot; set the window settings on the standard back to the next start is useful if the user interface is drawn through the change of M@@ DI @-@ Mo@@ di and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views of each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters . &quot;
the warning message area serves the tax of possibility to dis@@ connect war@@ nings by an@@ ha@@ des of not more .
&quot; the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it may be the ad of symbols instead of scripts as well as the sync behaviour of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code in shared mode . see the different Mo@@ di . &quot;
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the picture of the Par@@ ser @-@ node in the document , can be set in details . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure of the structure , the following action is possible to change by pressing the structure with the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; in the structure of structural tree settings the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the actu@@ alization of the tree , can be opened automatically . empty knots are empty areas in text , while empty groups are found in which there is no element found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; the scope for the fixing of abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) , which can be un@@ fold in the editing , can be divided into groups , each can be used for multiple &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it can be valid for several &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it is valid for a valid group as in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; here , the plug @-@ ins can be managed by plug@@ ins . plug@@ ins are used by third side , which can be used by every cult @-@ enabled application , at most well @-@ known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; in case of a plug @-@ in must be specified : &quot;
&quot; address : the path to the Plu@@ gin , if it is not at a stand there , like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib . &quot;
&quot; input : this information is delivered to the Plu@@ gin , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode : check if the plug@@ in ref@@ uses the loading . usually only L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts can usually refuse the store , if this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the Plu@@ gin : is this activated , then test@@ et &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the specified information is correct . if the plug@@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the trou@@ bles@@ hooting was completely re@@ designed . the support for the non @-@ necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was set , as well as support for d@@ b@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a Deb@@ ug@@ ger @-@ Plu@@ gin has been implemented , which enables various implem@@ ent@@ ations via plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plug@@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ quant@@ ap@@ lus ; enter . &quot;
&quot; the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with selection of a suitable bu@@ gger plug @-@ ins in the project settings . with the button options , next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ in radio box , the specific settings can be changed . &quot;
&quot; when a project is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus interface : &quot;
a view in which the contents of supervised variables is displayed . usually appears in the left Do@@ ck .
&quot; a view in which all hold points , with line numbers and conditions are listed below . usually appears at the lower Do@@ ck . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) is shown . usually appears at the bottom dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger is necessary , if necessary , or it shares the Plu@@ gin with , on Deb@@ ate demands . this action is triggered by default , which must not be respected by a de@@ bu@@ gger . &quot;
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ ging session starts the meeting . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ate the har@@ vest@@ ing to requirements .
a HTTP requirement to the server sends a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to look the current document . the issue of this requirement is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger output .
&quot; shows the de@@ bug to start with the execution of the script and the current line , as well as the updated line will continue . if this happens , the execution will continue . if it happens , the script will start with the requirement . &quot;
&quot; indicates the de@@ bug to start with the execution of the script , without information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens , the execution goes further . if a de@@ bug is specified , the execution will start once a request will commence . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next statement in the script without going into the functions or include .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next command in the script , whereby if possible in functions and include a defective item . &quot;
&quot; shows the de@@ bu@@ gger to go over and go to the next so , as if there is not the current . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialogue in which a variable , or an expression can be entered , the monitored value appears in the vari@@ ance view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialogue , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable . &quot;
&amp; k@@ x@@ sl ; is a work of Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ sl ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; front @-@ end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that they can find at htt@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many more works of Keith .
&quot; this chapter describes how you can adjust &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , to your needs , and how you can help &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; help to get better . &quot;
&quot; document type edit packages ( D@@ T@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; quanti@@ fication ( D@@ T@@ EP ; s ) , to give support for marking and scri@@ pt@@ ing . you enable &amp; quantitative information ; capabilities such as car complet@@ es and not@@ ing rooms . for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or CSS ; . &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it consists of two parts , the day folder and the tool@@ bars . day folder contain two file types , the text file and instructions fast into a document than one user ever could . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s can be created by hanging ( see below ) , download or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see for details about converting . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool bar . shortly , one &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and the content of the pec@@ uli@@ ar dialog@@ es , the &amp; quantitative information ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; even . tool@@ bars provides a quick input of tags in a document without a risk of a type@@ writer . &quot;
&quot; tag files are nothing as a folder . they contain only the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c , and the Tag@@ XML files . tag files carry the name of the writ@@ able language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML , whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so many users have a better insight and more information about working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits will be placed in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of an Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing about itself otherwise . &quot;
the tag type is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid for the day type class . the name of the basic class for this class . ( family 2 only )
only for the Type Method . is the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 only )
&quot; if yes , the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
set a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
&quot; describes a attribute of a tags . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it lays down the name and the type of attribute . additionally , it contains further tags that will be displayed as this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc . this is an element @-@ element type element . &quot;
&quot; are the source codes used for the attributes in the day editor , and attribute tree to the attribute tree &quot;
requires resource = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to reach the source data .
requires resource = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p @-@ method@@ ology name within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus is used to achieve the source of data .
&quot; requires resource = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting edge and a method@@ ology name . the arguments that will be handed over to the method . may be empty or % day name % , which means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container day that group@@ ed the elements of a list together . it can only occur for an attribute description . it is an element type element element .
&quot; determines the position of the attribute tex@@ tures of a tags within a dialogue . this day can only occur for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty . &quot;
gives the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be available for each field in dialogue . ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this element is a only element type .
gives a list of elements that stop a day . this element is a only element type .
all day XML files must begin with an &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be tidy and closed .
&quot; spaces influence nothing but pay attention &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to review the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog can start in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus window , and select Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions . &quot;
&quot; at present , this function is not yet available . currently , verification takes only when charging the day XML files to &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; in the following an example for a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; ELE@@ MENT from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; scheme . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this day XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; in the following an example for a working family 2 day XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; revision function will be described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this day XML file should be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; day name = &quot; function &quot; type = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; status = &quot; string &quot; = &quot; string &quot; = &quot; string &quot; = &quot; string &quot; = &quot; string &quot; = &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &gt; &quot; ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &quot;
&quot; the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also quite simple and there is an editor that can be edited via D@@ TD : this allows you to edit a &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with entries : &quot;
&#91; General &#93; version = U@@ de 1 for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name . &quot;
one action can set up actions with settings ... to be created . Click new action to the same dialog :
&quot; this promotion assigned keys . using user button , button user can be assigned to a keyboard player ; with K@@ einer is the current key driver can be removed . &quot;
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered into the det@@ ai@@ ulated settings and inserted this text in the document on the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to edit the document or edit the document ( or parts of the document ) , but are the quick start @-@ dialog or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ EPs . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scri@@ pt@@ est variable in command line , such as sh % scri@@ pt@@ ase / scripts / gui@@ a / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable which can be used in command line : &quot;
&quot; % f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name is removed . &quot;
&quot; % pi@@ d : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ COP is used for the control of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the external script is used . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods mentioned above , a script input of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus may be submitted to the default setting . in the selection box input can be determined which is to be sent to the default setting . options are : &quot;
selected text : the selected section of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally done with this setting .
&quot; accordingly , the issue of the listed application can also be diver@@ ted . there are two types available : regular issue , which is written to the standard issue , error messages , which is set to the default issue issue , by which the value of the selection process is set to : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool@@ bar for each group . in that case it is not too many , therefore one can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the brand @-@ ups . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you have to add actions and configure . select settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom end of the window starts editing mode .
fill out all necessary fields and add the tag to the right tool bar .
&quot; complete all and , if the day attributes and you are planning their use , enable dialog &quot; Day &quot; if available , so that a input when using the use is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is that a bad symbol . who should remember the action with this icon ? let us replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; for creating a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; select from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphic other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select edit size others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol does not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day starts , I decided to create a starting button as a symbol . through the use of green ( green is usually less than loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should be at least to insert a message to the user ; starting in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after the creation of symbol no need to be connected to the action . this happens through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field , press a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; keep the user button and put it on with other tags , so there is still some , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to add some usual &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus functions for tool bar , or it should be shared to the tool@@ bars in several groups . make sure that the tool@@ bars can be selected via settings tool@@ bars . make sure that the desired tool@@ bar is selected . &quot;
&quot; I want to select the Tren@@ ner ( whole left above ) for my tool bar . after the selection of the element that is added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I want to add a quick way to access the con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note , as the separ@@ ator support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button the opposite of the start @-@ button . &quot;
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by Pro@@ bate of all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; in the proper folder . after new XML does not exist , it is im@@ bal @-@ loaded , but your tool@@ bar should be stored in the proper folder . please adjust their &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c , so that their tool@@ bar should be loaded ( s ) when a file is opened from the corresponding type . &quot;
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; for normal users can add documentation to the script language or form@@ att@@ ing language which you like to like . this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; check if someone has done it for you . &quot;
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc ; language . then you have to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . we &apos;ll have to leave the first part to you the second we treat .
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c you = path , relative to this file , e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index top item = page 1 , tag 2 , tag 2 , day 2 , day 2 , tag 2 = tag 2 = tag 2 = tag 2 = tag 2 = tag 2 = tag 2 = day 2 &quot;
the section tree defines the visible section of documentation in the documentation tree . for example you can see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation :
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c you = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level El@@ ements Top element = PHP 4.2 , PHP 4.2 , = table of Cont@@ ents , # G@@ etting Start@@ ed , # G@@ etting Start@@ ed , # G@@ etting Start@@ ed = Introduction , ... Basic Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic Reference = Optimi@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ... &quot;
&quot; note the # before G@@ etting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . that shows that it is about sub @-@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for the chess training ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash , but try it yourself . &quot;
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently the top end of the Bau@@ man@@ view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; file is displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing but pay attention &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; Res@@ our@@ c@@ end@@ ments will be replaced .
&quot; the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is to be displayed on the design of consistent help . for instance , when writing a &amp; PHP ; H for context help , the documentation would appear directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
a simple list of discre@@ ed context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c and save up to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / comp@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / doc / person@@ a / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you do this in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
&quot; if you are sure that these good and worth are worth shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation were used at the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use through the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for the use of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; you will not be rich , but proud to be with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the insured resources ( D@@ T@@ EP packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; resources can send to your friends , partners or otherwise to whom . in different places there is an email option , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ T@@ EP ) with email sent , tool@@ bar menu with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can be downloaded and only available if our team needs it as correct and usable for the publication , what is ensured by a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of resources are guaranteed , both for our team and later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you are asked for their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ re@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the case that you have several keys , you can stay in a dialog box ( URL @-@ preview can stay empty ) and click OK the upload of OK . &quot;
&quot; upload the D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ T@@ EP ) menu and upload tool bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree are started . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , still before installation , exam@@ ines &amp; quanti@@ fication of the resource by testing the integrity and Sig@@ ni@@ fication . in case of problems , it can be broken . if the integrity and the resource is correct , a message appears with the declaration of the origin@@ ator of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages which is currently not yet supported by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , it may be time consuming , because hundreds of day files may be necessary in tag XML format . there is easier way to convert a D@@ TD automatically into a D@@ T@@ EP package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started by the D@@ TD charging menu and convert a D@@ TD . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description that will be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears : &quot;
target name : the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / Regist@@ a / d@@ te@@ p folders .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Defin@@ itions : the string that will appear in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE day as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d should appear
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ T@@ EP following the conversion : when activated , brings &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; following the conversion of the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand these concepts and full benefit from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , you have to get familiar with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to bring them exactly these concepts without their understanding &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , the working range is divided into three areas : global , locally and projection . this distinction is concerned with a number of components in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses , available . of tool@@ bars over actions is all that is marked as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this allows the group of administ@@ rators to secure various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree which is available to each in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
&quot; local items represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local items are stored in the user directory , so they can only use this user personally . &quot;
&quot; project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be done with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder and patterns of all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the construction sector , the cart@@ ons with info and the tool@@ bars . please strike in , and further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the cart@@ on button with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as close the current , other or all Kart@@ ei@@ re@@ ite , re @-@ loading , delete or upload of the document , jump to a book@@ marks or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; legal action in the editor can lead to another context menu regarding the processed document content , such as basic processing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , edit the file under the mouse poin@@ ter or open the file , if the string is named under the mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; at the top end of the Edit@@ or@@ f@@ enst@@ ers there are the tool bar of the editor . at the moment , &amp; Ds , 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional will be shown as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bars will be shown . in the course of the further expansion of tool@@ bars , the tool@@ bars will be adapted to the new functions and thus associated user needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; then click the symbol that represents the tag , then you can add the data for that just one day . if you want to insert several attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can add to a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; important perspectives ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information about &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , to open and push through . in representation with Kart@@ ei@@ re@@ ders are available for files , project , sample positions , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation of construction purposes . &quot;
&quot; project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; quantitative tool . this view shows all files in the project and allows the managing the files in the project via right click . actions such as add , remove , upload or delete files from the storage medium can be performed with the displayed counter menu . &quot;
&quot; another option of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; there are all possibilities open . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which they are used . the category depends on the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; working range . global templates are always available , local templates are only available for the respective users and templates . more to templates is available . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available script languages . the concept of a breakdown in Global , Local and Project works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can easily retri@@ eve the information on a script . via the right mouse button you can start to edit or send by email . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one displays the internal structure of the active document . through left @-@ click of an element , the cur@@ sor is set to the position of the element . by right @-@ click of an element opens a list of commands in terms of navigation and collection of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears under the other construction sector . with it , man@@ fast attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . that &apos;s possible to change the contents of all the attributes with a few cli@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development . you can download documentation for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; it can be downloaded , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited , edited and viewed . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; two cart@@ ei@@ vers at the lower end of the window can be reached : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this Kart@@ ei@@ re@@ ite displays information about each in Quant@@ a running script . for example , the D@@ TD uses the current document and all changes to D@@ TD . &quot;
this Kart@@ ei@@ re@@ ite shows all errors in the market up of the current document . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed will give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are expanded and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and it is given the corresponding command . the chocolate stores of tool@@ bars is the opportunity to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ;
a further feature of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with an e @-@ mail . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar @-@ Archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if you have a tool@@ bar in an e @-@ mail you can secure them in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other un@@ loading and load !
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to adapt the place of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; you can get a number of options that can be delivered to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here . &quot;
if you have problems with Star@@ ts of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus you should check if your path contains the &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 bin folder . you should make sure that is not an older version of &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H before their bin folder . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ;
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimised for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a obvious leading up @-@ up language editor ? well , this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; K@@ DE ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , therefore , should be the suitable &amp; IDE ; &quot;
&quot; well , to the above claim must be held that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; K@@ DE ; it is not only possible that anyone else developed ? thanks to the &amp; K@@ DE ; it is not only possible to expand it , but it allows users and developers , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this is how they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; enables web development to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this allows the automation almost every task . by supporting the comp@@ resses , they can be able to mem@@ or@@ ise any scri@@ pt@@ ing group . ( more about it will find them in . ) &quot;
&quot; &amp; quant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development and has been expanded rapidly to a sophisticated editor with many powerful features . &quot;
&amp; quant@@ a ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; quant@@ a ; associated with original developers left the GP@@ L license and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more in details of the details are associated with help : / quantitative information ( either this URL in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / quantitative information ) . &quot;
&amp; quant@@ a ; currently being developed and cared for by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as MAN@@ T@@ IA am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list from files that you have opened . this list changes every time when you can open a file , which is not taken out , whereby the oldest record is taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to store code parts and all files as templates for later use . look in the section of templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project pre@@ es@@ folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ tion from the cli@@ p@@ board , special characters included in the &amp; HTML , so that it is displayed correctly and not understood from the browser as form@@ att@@ ing instructions . &quot;
&quot; convert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; file , which is the correct way to insert of special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; it is primarily used to add &amp; URL ; s in the anchor @-@ day . &quot;
switches the block selection and off . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift key ; check out .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages are available !
search for a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind gre@@ p or used GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
&quot; shows the message window , or not . that is the window , in which you see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger . &quot;
the problem and inser@@ tion of the problem rep@@ orters at the bottom edge of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the problem reporter is activated when you replace the structure tree .
shows the tool @-@ old left from the main window . this column allows you to put my book@@ marks with a single click .
&quot; if book@@ marks in the current file , they will be appearing in the menu with entries or next , depending on the cur@@ sor position in the document . &quot;
&quot; book@@ marks of other opened documents appear in the menu , after the fil@@ en@@ ames of the other documents . &quot;
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
a dialogue to insert files into the current project . the selected files are then copied into the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this enables to copy graphics files into your project folder , or sub@@ folder , and then add to the project . &quot;
downloads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and if you have another input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . chapter &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects can be found details . &quot;
&quot; loads a tool @-@ tool bar . these are stored in the project / tool@@ bars , and are only in this menu , if you are assigned to this project . &quot;
a dialogue to store your tool bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bars : local or project .
open a dialog to add a new tool bar . this creates only the name . actions must save the tool@@ bars via tool@@ bars and you will be asked if you want to store the tool@@ bars via tool@@ bars .
&quot; a tool@@ bar removed from the visible range . it does not extingu@@ ish them from the hard disk . if you have not yet saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
&quot; thus , you can send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; team , so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu option opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as an app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; allows up@@ loading of tool@@ bars on the main server , where any other can access it . see . &quot;
&quot; charging a &amp; D@@ TD ; , which you have made or any other has made and convert into the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format . &quot;
&quot; loading / re@@ loc@@ ating entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; should be folded , without the whole &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; if this globally is not available , the store will fail . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day event dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the menu Tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent setup of tags . currently , this means only with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent setup means that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , the inser@@ ting of a tool@@ bar ref@@ uses to resist the rules on this location . &quot;
&quot; in the plug@@ ins menu , the available plug @-@ ins listed below the listed menu points are listed below . Click on , click the plug @-@ in plug @-@ off . &quot;
cho@@ oses the syn@@ tax@@ ic@@ tion mode for the current file . the list of available her@@ ed@@ ging schem@@ ati@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version .
cho@@ oses the type of line identification . very useful if you know people to use the other OS platform to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using the external application Ti@@ dy .
&quot; immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries the change may need time or im@@ nice graphics . recommended is the box set mode , which is also the default setting mode , or the lower window mode , which is the representation in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu includes an entry for each open window . with selection of a contract the appropriate window is activated . &quot;
the display of the status bar switches at the lower edge of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; main hub .
changes in this dialogue include any application that use the K@@ HTML part including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ brows@@ ers .
jud@@ ging the behavior of the editor &apos;s behavior . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you find details .
&quot; a dialogue appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars , or add which to the list can follow . &quot;
&quot; this should produce an aid according to the field of mouse , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; and quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project , developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus development in financial form , they find the way here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled at the top of the project , as for example , after filling the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project , all these paths and author of information can be completed later on Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties project features . &quot;
&quot; here &apos;s the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name file , file will be completed automatically . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus project file . by default it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension of web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can see the server address of the machine , which you want to access , one , except one edited local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol may be used . depending on setting the remote computer , an adaptation could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder , in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder , in which the tool@@ bars can be saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows you to insert files from the local file system into the project . several files or whole folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you want to download and change the static web content you want to download and change . for ser@@ ver@@ aging scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) one has to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s leave when files , which are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , should be bound up . if a project is started on new , not an@@ gled . &quot;
&quot; using this option , all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make a accurate selection of good . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files through An@@ ha@@ k or , by removing the skins , clips from the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project assistant includes three settings that simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be installed in the menu with project properties in the frame profiles or using the CTR@@ L Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( wild@@ cards are possible ) which will be re@@ directed at projects such as project folder .
&quot; complem@@ entary option on top , even files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ signals are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the projection , which will be loaded with opening the project , can be read more about projec@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to select your desired de@@ bu@@ gger . currently , only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ plug@@ in can be set with the button options . in fact , trou@@ bles@@ hooting is described . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window profiles , high la@@ de@@ files ( see in ) can be set as well as the display of a tree view for each profile setting up a separate tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted , as well as a mailing list . see details . &quot;
&quot; in the lower window configuration one can turn event actions and add these actions , change or delete these actions , change or extingu@@ ish event actions , as if a previously specific event occurs , such as the sick@@ le of a file . see for details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project , which was opened , is currently not influence . &quot;
&quot; to open a different project , select project ... from the menu project or the icon project can open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog can open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is automatically stored . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , when &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , changed files . the same happens when you invite a new project . &quot;
the project planning provides free access to files in the project . the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; file behavior equally , however , the entries are open and open with ... in the right mouse button . &quot;
here you can choose different profiles . the profile contains information on the location of the uploaded files . see .
&quot; allows removal of the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button will low to prevent removal . &quot;
&quot; the password will keep in the kernel , and forgot at program . this possibility is useful if common up@@ loading files is necessary and the rather un@@ secure password to the record -@@ option does not come in question . &quot;
&quot; this will stop the transfer@@ ring or simply leave the dialog , if you can change your opinion before up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ la@@ de@@ files can be uploaded and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to various servers . when working or creating a profile , this dialog will appear : &quot;
&quot; that is the name of the server , to which the files will be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work . &quot;
&quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and installed Ki@@ o Sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS . &quot;
&quot; the port for the transfer . normally , this must not be changed , except for the network administrator a service does not operate on the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . please use it according to your discretion . the password is stored on the plate , so that it can &apos;t be easily read , but everyone with programming requirements can be easily seen in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a special view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply diving of view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded , and replace the un@@ opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be saved in the menu project or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar , opened or deleted . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above , tool bar in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus are best mentioned above the menu tool bar . using tool@@ bars , it is treated below in the section adding to tool@@ bars below . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar and symbols can be set either by using the context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , which can be done with the New Action , which can be specified in the dialog , which can be specified in the dialog , which can be specified in the dialog , which can be visible on this or other tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to a action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , additional entries will be removed and action processed that are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tool@@ bars ... and settings actions are set .
&quot; templates are in essential document@@ aries , code buck@@ le and files to link . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; used templates , basically as a common file system with ext@@ end@@ able organization and interfaces . you can copy , move , move , or any one of the existing directory in the storage room . templates have set up in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you imagine for the file system . &quot;
some with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified on each template in front of using .
&quot; binary is all that is not pur@@ er text . it can be inserted any file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are usually found in documents by using a combination ( e.g. pictures with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . further information on the templates tree is available . &quot;
&quot; documents can be created from any text documentation . based on these templates , new documents can be created . usually a simple report for the purpose and organized the work in appropriate ways to be efficiently . some examples may be found under global templates . see also for more information on the templates tree . &quot;
&quot; this type of templates is useful if not a new document , based on a template but the same text area should always be inserted into documents . you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl . some examples are available in the storage room under global templates . see also for more information on the templates tree . &quot;
&quot; as the name says we serve these templates for all websites as templates . they are a collection of different documents , which can be organized in a file structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; design a document structure according to your own ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select File Format to save as local template .... &quot;
&quot; once this is done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . watch in the project area under project management . &quot;
&quot; in your document , select text in your document . alternatively , select your selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection may be easily drawn with pulling and laying on the construction of templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file will only copy in one pre@@ text file . you can use all the file management functions for this , such as drawing and inser@@ tion or inser@@ ting over the file @-@ tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click on the file tree or in the project files structure view to a folder on the right and secure Site template , secured a name for the template and secure it , but of course it can be saved as local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project arrangements allow a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ er lines or create a dynamic with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link with them . in addition , one can keep some things when using templates in projects very profound in mind . &quot;
the preliminary structure in the sub@@ window Tem@@ plates are based on the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / gui@@ a / Tem@@ plates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / Exec@@ a / Tem@@ plates / Supp@@ orted files . each of these folders is equivalent to one of four types of containers as explained above .
&quot; to determine the behavior of a folder with the right mouse button , click on the folder and select in the context menu tab . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a select field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is low , as soon as the attributes is ver@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits all except the regular folders in the previous article . if a regular folder should be activated , it would be explicitly activated in this path except it would be explicitly activated . if nothing appears , it is likely to be found in a regular folder . &quot;
&quot; permitted or determined text for templates in this folder . this might be general head@@ lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project , and allows copying contents into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ er , a complete presentation already with matching head@@ lines / foot@@ er lines . &quot;
&quot; in addition , using the context menu ( pointing to the right mouse button ) , you have a complete command collection for adding folders , or copy and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL editor , which can be reached via the menu view . the first mode replaces the editor window in two parts : the text editor and the V@@ PL editor . &quot;
&quot; the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cur@@ sor appears , then you can edit and if necessary for source code editor , in which the changes in the V@@ PL code is visible . &quot;
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor at a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it &apos;s not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit &amp; PHP ; there is no plans to change these behavi@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works exactly like the first , except that at the same time the changes both in the source editor and in the V@@ PL editor will be activated , this mode is already active , the button pressure is activated by a window to the others , whereby the position is maintained in the document . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; Editor and the source code editor is adjustable via settings Quant@@ a .... View can be set between synchron@@ isation after one click , or automatically . in principle , the recommendation can be set automatically . basically applies the recommendation : a small span@@ king for fast calcul@@ ator and a large span@@ king for slow PC . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to change the title of the website , so the creation of invisible tags can be created with the V@@ PL ; editor will also be called , as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; this allows you to change the following : &quot;
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . one click into the list allows the change of the input , e.g. key words on the column names and key@@ word key@@ word key@@ word 2 on the content column . &quot;
&quot; CSS rules are the new way to design the design of design in the browser . you can add CSS rules on the list below the list , or delete a change via the list is exactly as with met@@ a @-@ elements . editing of CSS rules is not currently supported . &quot;
it is possible to bind an external CSS style template by pressing the file button and cho@@ oses the appropriate file .
&quot; the use of the cur@@ sor is as in a text processing , as in a word processing , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor is quite strange . the markings works as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing or delete . &quot;
&quot; tags is made in the same way via the tool@@ bars as in the source code editor , which is to be noted that the inser@@ tion of tags should not be removed earlier , i.e. an anchor tag , surrounded by text , must be removed any other se@@ al@@ ous day . &quot;
some of the tool@@ bars such as the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled . you will later work in the &amp; V@@ PL ; you will need to be used in this release the tables or lists tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; a tool for exam@@ ining st@@ ills . in contrast to other programs for breast@@ plates is possible to search for certain elements and the execution of the st@@ ori@@ ent situation can be tra@@ cked .
&quot; to comp@@ ile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully comp@@ ile , you need except &amp; K@@ DE ; still libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml ; available at a typical installation of &amp; K@@ DE ; already available . &quot;
&quot; stops in a presentation , at a place in one of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g loaded stil@@ - or x@@ ml file or on the current node . new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ d@@ b compatibility mode , you can be removed and activated points in a specific file and line number and later . &quot;
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without a file name . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the top @-@ charged style file with rel@@ ativ@@ em path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is the following input possible for example :
&quot; in this command , it is checked on a partial or complete agreement with a pre@@ age called QNAP ® or a specified mod@@ ulation name . &amp; eg ; template is agreed with each QNA@@ P@@ ME , which contains the template template . &quot;
&quot; each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; &quot; QNAP &quot; &quot; will be extended according to the rules defined by the X@@ SL : test@@ 1 &amp; eg ; extended to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / trans@@ forms : test@@ 1 &quot;
an an@@ rag@@ ged point has to be dissolved for the associated UR@@ I and Z@@ eil@@ number . this will be automatically re @-@ checked when charging the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . hold points are re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each passage .

there are lots of graphical tools to compare . why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I have written .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contributions made many changes and at the same time it had corrected many places . another programm@@ ers had changed much text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts with merge .
&quot; the program was used by me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly had changed within this lines . and there was no evidence of the places where perhaps only the objec@@ tion had changed . this changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
&quot; that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , could represent differences within a row and changes to white characters . later , each of further useful functions were added . &quot;
&quot; if you like to compare the text , just copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it in one of the comparison window . &quot;
&quot; a function that made much work , was the same and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a fully @-@ called file browser . &quot;
&quot; also 3 @-@ way cl@@ ash will be fully supported . this is useful if two persons are working independently on one piece of code and modification at the same time . in this editor , you can even edit the result . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen photo shows three Qu@@ ell files to merge : &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with the same and merge complete folder . this screen photo shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when folder merge :
&amp; diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and clari@@ fies the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often have to check this function you will like this feature .
differences in white signs and tab@@ s are displayed visible . if lines differ in a certain number of white characters you can see it at a glance at the column at the left side of the left . ( no trouble changes if no one changes the recovery . )
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other diff@@ ers in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red colour means that both files are different . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can easily make the typ@@ ing work by using only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example : &quot;
&quot; diff@@ 3 folder , diff@@ 3 folder , diff@@ 3 file folder , diff@@ 3 file folder 3 folder , 3 folder , folder , folder , folder and folder &quot;
&quot; the opening dialog allows manual selection of fil@@ en@@ ames , the selection about the file browser ( file ... ) or select a last @-@ opened file from the list of folding . you don &apos;t need to specify the third file ; if you have to leave the entry for C blank , the analysis of the differences with two files is done . &quot;
&quot; in the folder folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , then select the same or merge of folders . if you select a file , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ames from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if merge is checked , the input field is active for the target . however , it is not necessary to determine a output file immediately . you can also do this step later when saving . &quot;
the entry button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start with the same / merge .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text compare . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . in open dialogue , you do not need to select files , you can simply connect the dialog with the break @-@ button . &quot;
you can also use Dra@@ wing and Use : simply pull one file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
&quot; what idea is behind ? sometimes , a file contains several similar functions . if you would like to find out how much like these functions , it would be a relatively big effort . you might just need to copy the relevant sections , insert and compare these sections . &quot;
note : currently you can remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the f@@ use of text in a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors will interpre@@ t the pulling and insert text into another program as cut and insert ( instead of copying and inser@@ tion ) . in such cases your original data could be lost .
&quot; in the upper part of each text window is the information line . the info line of the source window contains the character A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ames and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that windows C is optional . ) every info line has a little bit over the line . then a small relief window will show the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three sources of source are assigned to the letters A , B , and C . a color blue , B , color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( this default settings can be changed via the settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; if a difference is detected , one sees to the color which file diff@@ ers . if both files differ is the default color for it red . ( colour for conflicts in settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s good to see in the next section ( merge ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the text there is the summary column . when differences were found , the column shows the appropriate color . with some programming languages where white signs are not so important , it is useful only to see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , e.g. white signs are only relevant in strings and commentary , relevant , rare individual cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which separates the summary column from the text , is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines . if the line turn is activated , the line is highlighted in broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result of the result ( below the compar@@ is@@ ons ) also has a Info line with the inscription : , the fil@@ en@@ ames and &#91; changes &#93; if you have the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are dissolved is saving disabled ! ! ! ( use buttons on the next dissolved / un@@ solved conflict in order to find out the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two compar@@ is@@ ons are used , every difference has to be solved at the same time a conflict of manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window , the group is highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed in all windows . ( this group will also be highlighted the current group . ) This group will be emphas@@ ized with the color background colour for the current range and on the left appears a black bar . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , through the automatic merge or by manual editing , no further line is left over the group ; it is displayed in these lines the text &amp; lt ; No line in the qu@@ el@@ lies . this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a mark which you may have to copy and add elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; interaction conflicts , however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy these text from the result window . go carefully with this feature . &quot;
&quot; note : if using the sources list the options are ignored , or Ign@@ ore C / C + + Comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs . &quot;
&quot; navigate mainly with the images and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are using one of the window , you can use the arrow keys to the right , at the beginning , C@@ tr@@ l @-@ start and Str@@ g end , si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the eye window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with inser@@ tion button , you can change between insert and transfer mode . ( default is the insert mode . ) &quot;
&quot; one click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns , the view of all window onto the beginning of the respective group ( as already stated in the section merge and the ed@@ itable output window ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ down / Str@@ g @-@ top ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture down@@ wards / Str@@ g @-@ picture down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture down@@ wards / Str@@ g @-@ picture down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict . &quot;
&quot; to copy the marking in the cli@@ p@@ board , you have to automatically copy the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l inser@@ tion ) option . if this is activated , you will be automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board and write the manual copying . be careful with this option , because you could acci@@ dentally write the content of the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; line versions are stored according to the underlying operating system . UNIX versions are using a row @-@ in @-@ feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use car back @-@ in \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not reserve the line @-@ end of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using binary files . &quot;
the options and list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved and re@@ produced at the next start . ( menu arrangement &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... )
&quot; select a let@@ tering with fixed width . ( on some systems , you can also use fon@@ ts with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you enable this option , differences in ital@@ ic script will be displayed . if the type@@ face does not support this representation , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; systems with only 16 or 256 colors could not be available in their pure form , but would not be displayed in their pure form but would be displayed automatically . on these systems , the button pre@@ ferences will automatically be an un@@ just colour . &quot;
&quot; if this option is activated , the tab@@ ulator button is inserted the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; when entering and press Return , the deposit of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is activated , each selection will automatically be copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . manual will copy into the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
you can choose which line type you prefer to store . the default value is the common choice on the used operating system .
&quot; in the comparison files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first step , all completely identical lines are ignored in the source files . only during this step , white signs will not be ignored . in this step white signs will not be ignored . however , white signs will not be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a car back @-@ off &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a row , but then they could only save one line @-@ off &apos; \ &apos; . usually igno@@ res &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; if this option is activated , however , if this option is activated , however , if this option is activated , this option has to be de@@ activated . during default , this option is de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and corresponding characters are ignored ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) ignored the differences however , but they are treated like white signs . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white signs . &quot;
inten@@ sively looking for smaller differences . the option is enabled in the default setting . it is effective in complicated and large files but slowly at very large files .
&quot; in the automatic transmission mode , this setting is determined , as long as the result of the selection is displayed , before the next un@@ used conflict will continue . &quot;
dis@@ solves automatically all the conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters in many files are less important . if you can only ignore these options in numbers or comments when the options are ignored by Ign@@ ore C / C + + -@@ comments .
these options are treated in the chapter on scanning the folders and implementation of a merge . watch for details under documentation to directory comparison and merge .
&quot; if a file is stored and an older version exists , then the original version is the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original file . if already such a backup file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original exists , this will be deleted without additional backup . &quot;
&quot; the language of the user interface fits . changing this option does not need the current running program . you need to finish and restart , so that the change is activated . ( this option is set in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; it is not available because the language will be set there globally over the control centre . ) &quot;
&quot; the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the top setting is used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; a short notice about the selection fields for encoding is a short notice , which is the local code . ( this can &apos;t be changed here and has purely inform@@ al character . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file code for source files . this influences how special characters can be handled and interpreted , as the coding for each file is adjustable individually , even files can be compared to different coding . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they may not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could function 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the pre @-@ processing command can be set only with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option one can design@@ ate the coding of the issue of pre @-@ processing commands . &quot;
switch this off to supp@@ ress her@@ b@@ ations of changes in white signs in text or over@@ sight . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ign@@ orial C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a colour @-@ coded over@@ sight column . but sometimes you might want to see the differences between two of three files ; gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; C , A &amp; B &amp; lt ; C , C or B &amp; lt ; C will be displayed next to the normal @-@ level column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines . simply use the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
orders the comparison window next to each other or over . this can also be useful for advertis@@ ements of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together . current file will work together with the file menu . if this function is used to restart the file name , then the name of the last source file will be used again , then the name of the most used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; in reading a file , it will be delivered first to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own processor @-@ processor which is precisely using your own processor . you can use this function for example , or to correct parts or to correct the application . &quot;
&quot; in reading a file , you will have delivered them first to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , the issue of the command is used only when you use your own processor . you can have a corresponding issue line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to enable the user more flexibility in setting of the Di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program it . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient . &quot;
&quot; in this context , use this pre @-@ processing command to convert row into large letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CV@@ S and other ver@@ sion@@ ing systems use some keywords for automatically added strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ key@@ word : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you are experim@@ enting with sed , you may begin to understand it and perhaps like this regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further pre @-@ processing command in line @-@ off suitable for line @-@ off . sed it / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every showing will be replaced by nothing but is almost deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several options on once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the requirements of each other . example :
&quot; instead , you can also need something different such as per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ e &apos; s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switch &apos; Aller@@ dings are different for per@@ l some details . where sed \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; s ) needs per@@ l ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data after normal pre @-@ processor are maintained for display and merge . the further operations change only the data that the line @-@ off @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus sees .
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre @-@ processor , the line @-@ off pre @-@ processor is the output of the normal pre @-@ processor . &quot;
&quot; the processor @-@ processor are very useful , but as with every function , the text changes or differences , you cannot notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often , programm@@ ers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively and guide together . &quot;
... for each object a proposal to merge ; you can adapt the proposal before the start ;
... can sim@@ ulate the merge and shows the sim@@ ulated changes without it
... &quot; leads selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or just with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to the compar@@ ing and merge of individual files . you need to open only folder on command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folders will be merged , the folder is used as a base . if no target folder is specified , used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically , do not merge the merge , you must select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; during the folder , you will inform you a small news window on the current progress . if you break the scanning of the folder , only the files are listed below . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ... &quot;
&quot; each file and each folder was found during the scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a single mouse click here . &quot;
&quot; the folder structure will normally be displayed together . you can double click on the + / - click on the item , or by clicking the arrow keys to the left / right . the directory menu contains two functions of all sub@@ directories and all sub@@ directories up with which you can open all folders . &quot;
&quot; when you click on a file , the file will be rest@@ art@@ ed and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details window to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action can not be selected automatically . if the merge is started , you will be informed about any problems of this type . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the above picture , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C . &quot;
&quot; identical to identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of entries is different . &quot;
&quot; file are considered identical , when all of its contents are identical . then also folder the same color . with folders , the age is un@@ considerable for its color . &quot;
&quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . colours reflect the colours of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old . &quot;
&quot; a and C identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a , B and C do not have the same data type ( e.g. if a A folder and B a file is ) : error : contra@@ dict@@ ory file types . as long as such fla@@ wed objects , this merge cannot be started . &quot;
... a and B not have the same file type ( e.g. if a A folder and B a file is ) : error : contra@@ dict@@ ory file types . as long as such fla@@ wed objects can exist , this merge cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; the mode for synchron@@ ization is active when only two folders and no explic@@ it target folder , and if the option directories are syn@@ cing . then choose &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action is identical . if any folder should be identical . if one entry ... &quot;
... &quot; A and B exist , but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees only as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for output file only B ; directly after merge , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. ) &quot;
&quot; if two folders will be merged and select the option of new file , then exam@@ ines &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and select the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical . if these files are not fixed , the merge doesn &apos;t be started . &quot;
&quot; during the meeting you will run a file after the other . it status column indicates that when the merge was successful , and according to other messages when the merge is concluded , you should make a last review and see if the status is in order . &quot;
&quot; if in connection dialog the file comparable method is selected , K@@ diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number of ung@@ sters , dissolved , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for dissolved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can select either the straight selected entry ( file or O@@ dner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all merge @-@ related actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start together . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have not specified a target folder , then the three folder merge mode C is used as a target , when two @-@ folder merge will be selected as a target and used as a target , A and / or B is used as a target . &quot;
&quot; if you select a target folder , please check if all entries should be displayed in the folder structure , even in the folder structure , check these options to avoid un@@ pleasant surprises : &quot;
&quot; to bring together all entries : select directories in the directory menu , or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) to take part in the current element : select the promotion of the current element or press F@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; if due to contra@@ dict@@ ory file types , there are still invali@@ d inter@@ actions , a message appears that point out to the fla@@ wed elements . they can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you lead all entries , a dialogue window will appear with the options , sim@@ ulate and break down . &quot;
&quot; choose sim@@ ulate , if you want to see what would happen if you really want to do without the really changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual operation is necessary ( lead a single file ) , then a combination window ( note the screenshot ) opens . &quot;
&quot; if you are finished with a file , select directories again / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , will continue his work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , a message appears and exhau@@ sti@@ ve status information . at the end of the list you &apos;ll see some error messages that will help you select the cause of the problem , or to solve the problem of the problem , or to solve the problem in any way before you run with merge . &quot;
&quot; if some entries were collected individually , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and execute for later together all entries will not happen again . even if this merge has been dealt with or not saved , these entries will be changed once again . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory @-@ merge with these options :
only files that fit onto the specified pattern are displayed in the element @-@ tree . separate plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default value is * . folders does not need to match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not shown in the element @-@ tree . it can be entered into the element @-@ tree , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original * .@@ O . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not shown in the element @-@ tree . it can be entered into the element @-@ tree , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original * .@@ O . &quot;
ignored files that are ignored by CV@@ S . many autonomous produced files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder is specific with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ signals . )
&quot; in some file systems files , files have a version attribute . in other file systems , a file size is marked . this option lets you decide if these files are displayed in the element @-@ tree or not . this option is enabled in the default settings . &quot;
&quot; links to files : when the option is switched off , symbols are compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links are disabled . this is de@@ activated in the default settings . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the links like normal folder will be addressed and recur@@ sively searches . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crash@@ es not lead to a final folder and run &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crash@@ es off . ) This option is switched off . &quot;
&quot; execute a complete analysis of each file through and shows the statistics columns . ( the number of dissolved , un@@ search@@ able , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when it is applied to files which does not contain any text . ( give an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; however , if you compare large files on a slow network , it may be faster , only changing date and file size . however , this speed advantage costs you a certain degree of safety . please use caution . this option is activated in default settings . &quot;
&quot; similar to trust the date of date . there is no real comparison instead . the files are considered identical when copying the date of changes . please use caution . this option is activated in default settings . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ating the synchron@@ ize mode , when two folders are compared and no target folder was indicated . in this mode the suggestions for merge are identical . the results from merge files are stored in both folders . this option is available in default settings . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , copying the copying of the newer file as an action . ( this is considered uns@@ afe , because it is assumed that the other file has not been changed . ) This option is switched off in the default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or file is replaced by another or delete , then the original version will be renamed and receive the .@@ original file extension file with the .@@ original file extension , so this is without another backup . this option also applies in default settings . this option is enabled in the default settings . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder merge folder would be visible to the merge of single files ; you can switch off the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want to switch the main window in the window menu and change the main window of the window window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file via double @-@ click . nevertheless , you can use a single file menu in the directory menu . once you save the result , the status will be done directly and the file will not get together again when you start the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost if you read the directory again : read the directory menu : read more &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with help from K@@ IO @-@ Sl@@ aves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders that are available on local or remote machines .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line resem@@ bles a folder within a compressed archive file with a local ste@@ wards .
a URL has another syntax than local files and folders . a few things you should note :
&quot; a path can be relatively and@@ . or .. included . that &apos;s not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished , whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file is assumed to be a link target . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no possibility to edit per@@ missions or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions , or the change of change from the original . ( note the option of confidenti@@ ality of size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main uses is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op first starts to launch the built @-@ in differences . in order to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then choose In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is applied as a part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . then it starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch will start to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if any of the original files exists . besides , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the production of the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ is@@ ons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . the merge or the compar@@ is@@ ons of folders will not be supported in the context mode . &quot;
&quot; the tool with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now he@@ w ) is already available . additionally , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can lead us as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I &apos;ve been using GP@@ L programs very long and have learned a lot in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all the programm@@ ers who have gone this way or to go .
&quot; you can comp@@ ile the program from the sources and the configure script probably not the right PRE@@ F@@ IX to K@@ DE . in the pre@@ set , K@@ DE can not find the resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file , you will find more information regarding this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white signs are different , these lines are treated as identical ; but if only a non @-@ white signs are different , the line will be treated as not identical . i@@ F similar lines of next to Each other , this particular company , this is the case of the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor does not notice any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this important information is needed , however , if the result is simply saved as text file and it &apos;s too much effort to design an independent file format , which could store this information . &quot;
the effort for this was so far too big . you can restore a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text should be used another editor .
&quot; after removing text , suddenly , no sr@@ c lin@@ s ; appeared and the text can &apos;t er@@ ase itself . what does it mean and how can this be removed ? &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already use many colors to produce under@@ going . even more her@@ ap@@ point would be conf@@ using , and is missing the purpose . please use another editor for this . &quot;
many good ideas and errors came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all the functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you will need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.1 or later . &quot;
information about how you can use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE you can find on the homepage .
a list of last changes can be found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the Ch@@ angel@@ og file in the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; to comp@@ ile and install on a system with &amp; K@@ DE ; to comp@@ ile and install , use the following command at the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system , installed in the K@@ DE . if you are uns@@ afe , you will find more details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file . &quot;
&quot; da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ akers are used , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . should however difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists . &quot;
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Um@@ sch@@ alt ) copies in the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the marked text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ insert ) add text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current marking .
&quot; only differences : files are identical in all folders , do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the target folder . &quot;
( in the current version version you have to read about these options the folder with the function Update again . )
&quot; only entries are displayed , the differences are shown . if the target file doesn &apos;t already contain these files , they are missing according to merge . ( behavior will probably be switched on in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in the default program . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to choose from the source with Lab@@ eling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the results window . if the lines are already available , they will return on the button accordingly . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . under@@ set@@ point in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white signs . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a miniature look for all virtual work areas . it is quite convenient to change the running programs on the surfaces , to finish their size , or move it . this works both within a work@@ space as well as at several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work space as well as those able to display applications . the applications can be selected and even moved to other desktop .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . movement is possible both within a working area and other working areas . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager is cli@@ cked , the context menu will appear only the two entries of P@@ ager . however , the context menu will appear only the symbol and the name of the application and the entries will appear : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of the desktop . appears only if it was cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . appears only if it was cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if the cross field is highlighted , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with central mouse button on the Desktop , and also to other work@@ spaces . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager will display the name of the virtual desktop . &quot;
&quot; cross this field leaves the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of the virtual desktop display . it &apos;s along with name display , the names are provided with ordin@@ ator numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st floor space . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the background of every desktop is also displayed as a background at &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the current programs are displayed as a small window in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . otherwise , only the empty work@@ spaces are displayed , in order to enable the selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its standard symbol and pixel map shows a small view of the real programme window . remark : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager will be determined : classic leaves &amp; K@@ p@@ ager to appear in some other window managers ; horizont@@ ally shows all virtual work surfaces in a horizontal row and vertical in a vertical range , which is very good for displaying the later@@ ally on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini@@ atures in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display window as symbols or with its content and is also running outside the control bar . &quot;
Click the right mouse button within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent selecting from the switch switch ... lets you appear to dialog settings .
currently this can &apos;t be changed in dialogue settings . but you can do this manually :
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor , such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not need a write permission for the file , you &apos;ll need to register to your system administrator . in this file , you need to apply the keys to the keys or sign up to that file . possible values are : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package base , you will need a working installation of the K@@ DE basic packages . &quot;

&quot; &amp; I like ; is a screen saver . you can enlarge with &amp; it ; a part of the screen size is interesting : for this purpose , you can read a magni@@ fying glass for the small printed or the exact viewing of a photos . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag ; . &quot;
&quot; it is a very powerful application , which is constantly expanding around new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers . &quot;
&quot; when you like it ; start , a window appears as above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window is displayed as a magni@@ fying window . the picture that is displayed in the magni@@ fying window is described as a selection window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a mov@@ able magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you may take a select screen in the magni@@ fying window ( selection mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to view the mouse poin@@ ter in the enlarged window , select the setting of mouse poin@@ ter . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is still not able to recognize the form of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard K@@ DE ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ Maus@@ oleum . &quot;
&quot; in select mode , you can adjust the select window to your own needs . you can move it to arrows and bri@@ st@@ les and change its size . this can be done in the following ways : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window , and hold the left mouse button , so you can move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; if you are in addition to the &amp; Shift key ; push or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the select window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the box window . note that the upper left corner of the selection process will remain fixed and only the lower right corner is to move . &quot;
&quot; it has a lot of functions . you can copy the enlarged picture directly to the printer , copy into a file , copy into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , turn the image and much more . &quot;
&quot; starts or stops the display of the display . the stops of updating causes the required CPU time to 0 . &quot;
&quot; select the Update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , Ho@@ ch , Very high ) . the higher the updates rate , the more CPU time is required . &quot;
in this mode a select window is displayed . the selected section is displayed in a window .
&quot; &amp; I like ; automatically uses your introduced short commands to store files , opening a new window , printing , ne@@ ri@@ ads ( with the button document once again invite in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and cl@@ amp &amp; etc . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mou@@ sec@@ lick on the same spot as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter takes a while on the same spot . it is thought to help people who suffer from RS@@ I syndrome ( repet@@ itive strain logic syndrome ) , and each of each mouse click pain@@ s . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mou@@ sec@@ lick on the same spot as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter takes a while on the same spot . it is intended to help people who em@@ ulate the repet@@ itive strain In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome , and each of them can em@@ ulate pain@@ s with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can circum@@ vent the pain when using the mouse , and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately you suffer pain that are related to the use of your computer . do you suffer a doctor if this is not done yet . &quot;
&quot; to make it clear : even though &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain avo@@ ids , which are caused by clicking with the mouse , it is opposed to pain that is caused by the mouse due to the mouse , us@@ eless . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result may fall differently . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click once you interru@@ pt the movement shortly .
&quot; is the smart shift activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after the pressing of the mouse button . move it until the end of the movement , it is waiting for a little exercise , but you get used quickly . &quot;
&quot; this time , after the end of the maus@@ oleum , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click leads . &quot;
&quot; intel@@ li@@ gent@@ es is enabled , intel@@ li@@ gent@@ es is enabled , the swi@@ m@@ ous@@ al shifting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is activated . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after the supp@@ ress the mouse button is waiting before it leaves the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the click by mouse shift . if this function is activated , followed by a break , one click with the right mouse button . a slow PC is stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is delayed , you can move &amp; K@@ DE ; to upgrade the reaction time . open the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here . there is a shift sound buffer , which you can set to a lower value in order to reduce the response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , is &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; started at each start of &amp; K@@ DE ; available at the moment only under &amp; K@@ DE ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window frames please refer to the respective documentation , to find out how you start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; set all settings on the values , which have been set to open the dialog . have already pressed the button on the user , the settings will be reset to the latest pressures of users . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , you should first use the smart shift . if you &apos;re used to get used to the automatic mouse click here . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary necessary to reduce antenna times by &amp; K@@ DE ; in case of sounds . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you should be aware of which places a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on the browser window , which doesn &apos;t link to un@@ intenti@@ onal reactions . you can therefore park your mouse on such places until you would like to use them again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse is ru@@ ck@@ eted , you should clean your mouse . it is usually pretty simple . the trick is clean , but also the roles that come with the mouse ball in touch . &quot;
&quot; first you need to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , the mouse is to mouse to mouse . however , it should be clear when you view the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the ball . these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and dirt sho@@ ots can scratch easily with a flat blade or finger@@ nail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system breaks the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; when you use the intelligent shifting , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer finish the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under a other window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution for this problem is that you can run yourself a mouse click here . through this , the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is set back and you can continue working as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse click , and sets the cur@@ sor to another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor there , where you want to place it . however , if you want to make it a neutral field of desktop , if you don &apos;t want to make sure that the mouse click on a neutral field . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter and menus and the front@@ lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with intelligent shifting , but I don &apos;t create it to edit text . &quot;
&quot; intelligent shifting is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can cope with it . it is very possible to execute the cli@@ p@@ board or move it into any other action , where you probably want to prepare any other action . here are some advice about this : &quot;
&quot; do not use the smart shift , if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; hold a single click on the bottom of the text area , while you move the mouse button on the other end of the text , and keep the mouse button once again . &quot;
use the audi@@ ble mouse click here . it will be used every time when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button is using a sound like a mouse click . so you can use the smart shift also without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some practice .
&quot; to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the X@@ test extension for &amp; X window , must be installed . that should be the case for most systems . &quot;
the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available if the system features a sound card and loud@@ speaker and set them correctly .
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emphas@@ ized the mouse button , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter has been dist@@ orted shortly . this program was designed for people who suffer from RS@@ I syndrome and prepare the bri@@ ght@@ ful pain . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured that there is a certain time that a pulling process begins , before the mouse button is let loose . in this way , the pulling and laying be carried out with the mouse . &quot;

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with the m@@ ute users can talk to their computer .
&quot; with the &amp; k@@ mouth program , m@@ ute users can talk the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list of talking pro@@ positions which should be discussed once again . &quot;
&quot; in the first page of the assistant ( lin@@ kes screen photo ) , enter the command to be used later for the speech output of text . further details will be found in the description of the setup dialog@@ s . &quot;
&quot; on the second side , choose the standard text @-@ password @-@ book . from the text suitable you can often choose , without typ@@ ing them . the text passages can be processed naturally . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen photo ) you determine the dictionary for the Wor@@ ter@@ ess . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can only read the word lists with a Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly evident and contains essentially a input field for the key@@ at@@ ure@@ ing@@ hub of your sets ( the lower white field in the screenshot ) and a storage memory of the already spoken sentences ( the top white field in the screenshot ) .
&quot; if you &apos;re k@@ mouth ; correctly , you can enter the sentences you want to hear . each spoken sentence is attached to the sp@@ ouse memory . you can choose from these sentences which should be re@@ spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the installation dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog includes two cart@@ on cards , language output and att@@ itudes , page Wor@@ ter@@ ess , as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the box language issue , enter the command to command the language of the language . in the selection field under the input field , you can record the text @-@ encoding with text to the language generator . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text should remain unchanged as default on the language generator .
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be given as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholder : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command is based on your language generator . this command will be found in documentation to your language generator . examples are available in app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; if that is successful as language service , the text of the K@@ TT@@ SD is a standard &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ dem@@ on , the &amp; K@@ DE ; applications are a standardized interface for language output and is currently being developed in SV@@ N . the option of this option is sensible , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection step action after the selection of a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the key@@ boar@@ der or by choosing a text passage in the menu text book or in the body for text password . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of so@@ jour@@ n , the chosen text passage is inserted directly , and additionally inserted in the storage area . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is only entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; in the second selection field , you can design@@ ate whether the password @-@ book can be stored automatically at the closing of the editing device automatically . &quot;
&quot; the book is stored . if you select changes , the textbook is not stored . if you don &apos;t hesitate to ask , ask &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask whether the password @-@ book is stored . &quot;
&quot; the page Wor@@ ter@@ course contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the Wor@@ ding Field . in the main window next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth ; a select field , when this list contains more than a dictionary . with this drop @-@ box , you can choose to use the dictionary online dictionary . &quot;
&quot; using buttons on the right side you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries , or add the sequence of books or export them into a file . below the list you can adjust the language for the dictionary . &quot;
&quot; for this source , select the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the &amp; K@@ DE ; read the frequency of the individual words is easily identified by decl@@ assi@@ du@@ ous . in addition , you can compare the word list with a Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary . in addition , you can add the word @-@ written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can bring together the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask what dic@@ tion@@ aries should be merged , and how it must be weigh@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you will insert a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; re@@ directed words automatically into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary . &quot;
the main range of the window to edit text pass@@ ers is two divided . in the upper part the text pass@@ ers are presented as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you select a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding key records . if you have selected a text @-@ password , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; actions like new text messages or books add or selected text messages and books can be accessed either via the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar , or via a hing@@ ed menu . &quot;
&quot; the order of text pass@@ ers or text pass@@ ings , you can change by pulling the mouse to the new one or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this will be used otherwise , otherwise the selected fields of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this will be used otherwise , otherwise the selected fields of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is located in the input field , this is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the sp@@ ouse is used . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is a shifting tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar is ordered via the menu panel directly under the menu bar . through mou@@ sec@@ lick on the scra@@ p left side and pulling , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is crossed , a narrow base in the lower part of the main window with clu@@ es on the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not be crossed , this status bar is hat@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is displayed , each menu is arranged for text pass@@ able cloth@@ s with entries . the vest is arranged by default on the processing window directly under the tool@@ bar . through mou@@ sec@@ lick on the scra@@ p left side and pulling , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; probably , you do not have the command to correct or not fully entered . open settings k@@ mouth ; open the page of General settings and enter the command for voice speech output . ( see section dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer for further details . ) &quot;
&quot; the Edinburgh Festival is a language issue of the Edinburgh University . currently only English , Spanish and organic are currently supported . license allows to use the festival free of charge and spread without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the language output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival . &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is an integrated voice generator . currently it supports only the English language language . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and spread without restrictions .
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the language output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ ys . language output is then possible with one of the three following command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be turned on as default setting . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ eme to a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei . therefore you need an additional program to disman@@ tle the text in phon@@ eme . license allows for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in phon@@ eme to MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / mb@@ rol@@ a . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax liked the last sign of the text so that an additional sign has to be added . the full command is therefore more elabor@@ ated than in the other examples : &quot;
( CAT - ; ech@@ o quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / mb@@ rol@@ a / / usr / local / mb@@ rol@@ a / de@@ 1 / / usr / local / dev / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in a row . the option will send data as default setting .
&quot; the voice of voice @-@ dem@@ on of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ further language service , which provides all &amp; K@@ DE ; applications are currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different language output systems . &quot;
&quot; since setting up the language of the staff only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you have to use only as dict@@ kt@@ on as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; to setting the page K@@ TT@@ SD , which is installed in the installation dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully , you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires approximately 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that can &apos;t speak with people who can &apos;t speak lyrics by calcul@@ ator . a list is already saved , which can always be re@@ arranged ane@@ w . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language syn@@ thesizer contains . on the host a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed .

&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( htt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the K@@ DE @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility mailing list . you can also find the list about htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # K@@ DE @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility ) . &quot;
&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ts , you &apos;ll need to install program speech disp@@ at@@ cher and set correctly . see also &quot;
&quot; at the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as no speaker is furnished , the card speaker is displayed . see also if you have at least one speaker , the card card is shown . see . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , such as different male or female , or such that can differ in volume or speed . you should also use several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should use at least one speaker , before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use as the program speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker . &quot;
various spokes@@ man for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable with several printing @-@ eag@@ erly for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the cart@@ on postcard speaker in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the card speaker is displayed . this also appears automatically when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and no speaker is set up . &quot;
&quot; all the actors already appear in this list . the preferred speaker appears above in the list . the upper speaker is used for speech output , if an application does not exist . &quot;
&quot; using a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the nar@@ r@@ ator from the list . &quot;
&quot; using a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; using a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the nar@@ r@@ ator in the list below . the order of the speaker at the list determines its priority . &quot;
Click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ops system ; system .
&quot; here , choose a tuning type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the new nar@@ r@@ ator will appear on the card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click on Edit . &quot;
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts . go back almost . go back to the box map of General and check if you use language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . see now you can use &amp; kt@@ ops . please click on the map of orders to create text entries and manage . see .
&quot; if you have set at least one speaker , you can launch the voice list system by &amp; K@@ DE ; click on the cart@@ on postcard General to open this map . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; mark this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this start is successful , the card card orders will be displayed , and you can read text entries and read the selection , the T@@ TS system is activated and the T@@ TS system by &amp; K@@ DE ; disabled . &quot;
&quot; when kt@@ on is finished , then run &amp; kt@@ ops ; further , if the field has enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr appears automatically at the system &apos;s system control , it dis@@ appears immediately once the pre @-@ reading is complete . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this row , you can start essays , stop , stop and hold back again . &quot;
&quot; using buttons in this row , you can read the latest text in the &amp; K@@ DE ; cli@@ p@@ board or read a text file for reading . you can also switch the speaker for an order . &quot;
&quot; Click on users or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all sides . &quot;
&quot; the card orders will only be displayed if K@@ TT@@ SD was started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , please click on the cart@@ on postcard of General and cross language issue there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; check in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; K@@ DE ; you can read the text of the displayed web page . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs out . mark the text which will be read , and select in the main menu to read the text . after a short time the speech output should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web site . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML will also read and read other invisible brands . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; K@@ DE ; you can read text , check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs first , then select the text which will be read , and select the main menu to read the text . &quot;
this also works when &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; quant@@ a ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the message system of &amp; K@@ DE ; you can notify you of your fixed events . you can also read the text of these messages also by &amp; kt@@ ts .
&quot; in &amp; conversation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; K@@ DE ; you can set up different types of messages . you can notice that when in a IR@@ C @-@ channel a message appears when your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the IR@@ C message text . &quot;
&quot; support a &amp; K@@ DE ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry al@@ erts on the Settings menu of this program appears . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ according to the application . &quot;
&quot; filter for drawing print provide a good opportunity to correct &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is a good example . it is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b out of the news that can send K@@ mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as required . read also here . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; . for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filter is not necessary .
&quot; in filtering it will be edited , before being sent to the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . you are useful for the improvement of pron@@ unci@@ ation , to select wrong words or short@@ cuts , select a suitable language and speaker to handle specific defects of language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the work of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the edition of screen Re@@ a@@ ws has the highest priority . it will be dra@@ fted to all the other orders . when the edition of the Screen @-@ Reader is read , the orders will be continued again . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is going to be hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after the output of the warning .
News have the next highest priority . a message interru@@ pts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you are welcome to enter a long text on a website . &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ noti@@ fications are also news . read on this .
&quot; the rest are simple text@@ books . each order , which you encounter from the board map orders , is a text application . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that have text orders . text orders are intended for the issue longer texts that have no special drums . &quot;
&quot; all four orders will be held in queu@@ e , with the exception of the edition of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application will send out the issue of a Screen Re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one reads , this issue will be stopped . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters are never applied to the issue of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ ders . you will be applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text entries as well as on &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ News . &quot;
filters work the text and give it further on the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are implemented as modules . in the future there can be more types of filters .
replace parts of a text by other text . you can use either as words or as regular expressions . it will be delivered with pre@@ defined character strings such as : - ) by text or for form@@ att@@ ing messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understand@@ able form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ converting use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; created by a format into a different format . in the scope of delivery &amp; kt@@ ts are some X@@ SL@@ T files for the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
&quot; with speaker filters you can depend on the contents of the text or depending on the program to send the text on &amp; kt@@ ts . if you have set a female voice , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it , allowing you to read about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these various filters are adjustable rules , according to which he is applied for a speech output . if the filter does not apply that its rules does not apply to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; K@@ DE ; alert on &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it will be arranged through all enabled filters , which are arranged on the page below . processing of filters are done in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the furnished normal filter . if a filter is not enabled , it is not activated and is not used . filters will be removed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new filter click here . select the type of filters , and the following below shows are displayed . &quot;
&quot; in writing , you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . the text is exchanged in the text , then the text will be exchanged against the corresponding replacement parts . large and small @-@ sensitive will not be considered . &quot;
&quot; for your filters , enter a name for your filter . you can select this name only by the name of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column match and replace it in accordance with the string of the column . the list is shown in the shown order from above down .
Click here to move the marked word or regular expressions in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can upload a list of words or regular expressions from a file , store the current list or delete a list from a file , the entries will be attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language registered , the filter is only used , if the spokes@@ man speaks for the text order one of the here registered languages . Click on the button to hold a list of languages . you can also hold the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button hold hold . &quot;
&quot; here is a value registered , the filter is only used if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separately through Com@@ mat@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; using the program q@@ d@@ bus ; you will have access to the program q@@ d@@ bus ; you have to leave . if , for example , &amp; q@@ d@@ bus , the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 is required , you only need to copy copy . &quot;
&quot; the drawing filter will only be applied to the text when all conditions apply with one entry in the box Di@@ room filter . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when compared to words , the character filtering filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must be limited by divi@@ ding characters ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find no guidance for writing off regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; K@@ DE ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ cur@@ sions can be found in the package . &quot;
XML ; Trans@@ former transl@@ ating &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format into a different format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such conver@@ sions . it can only be installed on a well @-@ formed XML . the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
specify the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached on the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H is also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; by speaker filters you can send texts to a certain speaker , which is set up on the card speaker , or to a speaker with certain characteristics . you can design@@ ate that texts by mail from a female voice is to be read . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts , there is a text to the filter , there is a speaker for the text . the spokes@@ man is chosen using the speaker &apos;s speaker , which sends the text on &amp; kt@@ ops , and sending the characteristics of the speaker &apos;s speaker , you can write the selected speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value registered , the filter is applied , if the text contains the specified regular expression . is installed on your system at the &amp; K@@ DE ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular expressions can call this button to get help at input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to fix the regular expression on the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; place the properties of the desired speaker conditions here . if the text is fulfilled by the above filter conditions , the speaker is selected to display the desired requirements on the right . Click on the button to display the dialog list . &quot;
use these buttons to store or delete your microphone settings or delete all settings .
speaker filters will only be applied to the text when all conditions apply with one entry in the box Di@@ room filter if applicable . they must have at least one condition .
&quot; the language output API , by &amp; K@@ DE ; , with the programm@@ ers can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , which can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , allowing the syn@@ thesizer ; this syn@@ thesizer can be used . &quot;
the following section includes a short description of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ D@@ bus ; -@@ interface of the language output API of &amp; K@@ DE ; you will find the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( htt@@ p : / / accessi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications challenge voice output by the &amp; D@@ DE ; interface of &amp; K@@ DE ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d on the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; here is text of text to read and option , language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are more commands you can apply . for a list of all commands
&quot; open two &amp; console , window . start kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ t@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
&quot; I have set the &amp; HTML ; XML ; -@@ XML file ; but when using the module for festival , web pages will not be read . &quot;
&quot; due to a mistake in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you must install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone with that S@@ able at all works . that &apos;s what you do not need to read this voice to read Web pages . also , make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and to find on the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . &quot;
certain characters or inter@@ section signs seem to cause mistakes in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to create whole sentences or just co@@ w@@ wel@@ d . what can I do against it ?
&quot; first , make sure the option coding is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . is there any problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a character encoding filter . see . &quot;

&quot; language syn@@ thesizer , which are used by &amp; kt@@ ts , have their own license you &apos;ll find in the associated documentation or on the relevant websites . there are also voices that own a own license . &quot;
&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can find it in folder kt@@ ts@@ . also you will find the source code by k@@ de@@ au / / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / K@@ DE / . &quot;

KT@@ TS works with each language syn@@ thesizer which can be launched on the command line in a &amp; console .
&quot; the list of the above @-@ mentioned languages can be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , please draw the description of syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , according to information that are not yet included in this manual . &quot;
the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a custom@@ iz@@ able module architecture for voice syn@@ thesizer . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for use of another syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , you sit with the development team . &quot;
&quot; the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . &quot;
&quot; to comp@@ ile &amp; dict@@ ate ; you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) , including the k@@ deli@@ bs package and the development files for the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you purchase the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code for col@@ t , or to have downloaded every night currently selected Tar@@ ball , re@@ install and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you are using &amp; kt@@ ops , check first if speech disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your language syn@@ thesizer . for this purpose , you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ script of the SPD file . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; that uses the program of speech disp@@ at@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be so developed that the setup of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is also possible and the script @-@ conf@@ uses is no longer needed .
&quot; a long text will be broken into individual sets . the user can return , repeat or ab@@ rupt the output . &quot;
&quot; if an application is attached to &amp; kt@@ ts , you can request the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output . if you want to set a female english speaker . if you want to learn a speaker , otherwise it will be the best matching speaker . if you want to learn more about it , otherwise you will see a speaker . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the card speaker , click on and edit a speaker into the list or click on Edit , the card speaker is displayed . as an example , the installation of the module for Festival Interactive is displayed . details of the modules will be found under the following image . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program , if the path is contained in P@@ AT@@ H , you must enter the festival only . &quot;
&quot; select the text coding for text , which will be handed over to the festival . by voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts , this setting will be done automatically . generally , Western languages are ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , e@@ ased languages such as Czech or Slov@@ ak@@ ian use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders you make volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select a few kno@@ b and display these grey , these settings cannot be displayed by you . &quot;
&quot; some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices will require several seconds to be loaded due to their size , so that these quotes are already loaded with the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with larger memory consumption ) the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized faster . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet furnished one speaker ( or don &apos;t forget to click on users ) . &quot;
&quot; this check box is highlighted by the Start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr the program window , but not the program window is visible , but not the program window . Click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; this cross field is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is not running , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is read a text . thus , you have the opportunity to keep reading or otherwise drive . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders in the queu@@ e , along with the application that set the order , the number of phr@@ ases and the just worked set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card speaker . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can select a sat@@ in to the order that is selected in the list below , or go back . ( but not every contract consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with one click on OK , all changes of settings ( also on other cards ) are taken over and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will be sc@@ aled to the symbol of the system section . Click on this icon to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the map audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here , only text entries are listed and administ@@ rated . issues of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ ws , War@@ nings and News will not be displayed . more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts are available . &quot;
&quot; select the kind of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either with no support for the appropriate audio module is compiled or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can &apos;t download the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is used for the audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , select at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
&quot; set the speaker speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % equals about half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % about double normal talk speed . thus , these settings can be implemented , the SO@@ X program must be installed . &quot;
Click on users to adopt the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ops system ; system .
&quot; the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules , which are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device works with you . in doubt , choose standard . &quot;
&quot; on this map , you can set up special actions that will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language versions : &quot;
the edition of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ ws has the highest priority . it will be dra@@ gged to all the other orders . after the issue of the Screen Reader has been read , the orders received resumed . &quot;
war@@ nings have priority priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message interru@@ pts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application which speaks messages . if you are looking for a long text on a web site can be welcomed with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless somebody is welcome to enter the room .
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the issue of a Screen @-@ reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output in the queu@@ e . &quot;
&quot; this audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted . if the introduc@@ tory sound is enabled , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; settings on this box map are only valid for normal text entries . for news , war@@ nings and the issues of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ ws there are no special promotions when they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read by &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ notification fy messages read , start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click on al@@ erts . the card al@@ erts appears . &quot;
&quot; select this check box , in order to turn off the pre @-@ reading &amp; K@@ DE ; this setting is not marked , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads no al@@ erts . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , al@@ erts , in which a sound is played , of &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list , or delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog appears in which you want to add the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message before , the &amp; conversation ; sent if someone menti@@ ons your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which in the list has nothing else stated , will be ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
use this select field to determine what &amp; kt@@ ops do ; do if an event comes off . you have the following selection options :
&quot; if you select custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder : &quot;
you can enter the properties of the desired speaker . standard cho@@ oses the speaker that is displayed in the list on the list of the speaker card as top entry . see also .
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . for a certain event of a particular application a action is defined . otherwise , the action is implemented for all other events of the particular application . as last possibility the action comes to Tra@@ gen , which has been set under standard ( all other events ) . &quot;
the event All noti@@ fications for the application Standard ( all other events may not be deleted from the list . for this purpose you can define the noti@@ fications al@@ erts as follows :
&quot; use the button Save to store the settings in a file . use the button store to store stored settings from a file . if you want to begin with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all noti@@ fications will be deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for a voice issue . this standard contains trademarks for the control of voices , the voice of the voice and the pitch . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as the standard voice is used to use the festival in the issue of SS@@ ML .
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch of the festival configuration cannot be set on 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on@@ ized . &quot;
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE @-@ PU@@ BL@@ IC &quot; - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ TD Syn@@ thesis / syn@@ thes@@ is@@ .d@@ t@@ d &quot; &quot; M@@ um Bear . who has slept in my bed ? asked the bear . &#93; &#93; &gt;
&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filter and pro@@ positi@@ onal filtering filter ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds must start writing , since only the first set must be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text contract . thus , you can also stop or cancel , even if the language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers do not support this directly . &quot;
&quot; here , you can see the set @-@ down filtering filter . when the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts are automatically established . you can change its settings or add other pro@@ positi@@ onal filtering filter , but you can cut it off . &quot;
&quot; easiest option to learn the setup of the speaker selection . turn the speaker selection and select text to read , change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker is changed . for this purpose , you must have set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; then , faster with reading can begin , since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long , &quot;
&quot; then you get essays on board map , or can ab@@ ort orders , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter will automatically be set automatically when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr . it cannot be switched off , just away . do not change anything at this filter , unless you know what you do . &quot;
&quot; the proposition can compare the text to the pro@@ positi@@ onal sign ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the pro@@ positi@@ onal sign ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the pro@@ positi@@ onal sign ( Dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the pro@@ positi@@ onal sign ( tab@@ ul@@ ators are automatically removed from the text ) . note that the standard pro@@ positi@@ onal detection filter will be the same composition . &quot;
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; K@@ DE ; messages ( k@@ . ) , War@@ nings , News and the issue of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ ws . &quot;
&quot; if you come from los@@ see the normal Sat@@ z@@ lim@@ estone filter , you can add this back by charging the _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the box office selection , you can write the speaker settings for the application . the card card is displayed if &quot;
&quot; using the standard speaker ( the speaker on the box card ) . in other words , no microphone properties are specified . &quot;
&quot; use of the pass@@ able speaker , which has all features of a furnished speaker . if you don &apos;t select the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise cho@@ oses &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise , the spokes@@ man , who originally selected the originally appointed properties . &quot;
&quot; select the method for entering the desired speaker properties , click on one of the selection buttons . &quot;
&quot; here , select the characteristics of the desired speaker . if this property doesn &apos;t matter , don &apos;t give anything . &quot;
mark this check box if the property should have priority in front of other features . you can also set up several markings here .
&quot; as the language is a critical factor with understanding , this will always be used as a priority feature . the only case you may want to specify the attribute language , if you may know that a specific application text will be entered into a different language than that of the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to delete all properties in the field speaker , which equ@@ ates to the most interesting , click on the selection button , and then use the speaker , which is the most similar to the following . &quot;
in this case 0 stands for the last word order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( without any order number is the entry 0 required ) .
&quot; kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr crash@@ es immediately when it is started . I compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I don &apos;t get any tra@@ ce@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer has crashed and &amp; kt@@ ts . probably , you have to register . at G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved , possibly a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to upgrade or un@@ install G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output via AL@@ SA is not working when I play music simultaneously with another application , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; console ; a message appears that says : &quot; to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system there is a problem that conflicts in AL@@ SA , which prevent a simultaneous contact of several PC@@ M devices . hints for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I loaded an additional voice for the festival from the Internet . I installed it and can use it in the festival , but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice . &quot;
&quot; add in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / festiv@@ al@@ int / vo@@ ices the new voice . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; if you have found the voice , on which you have found the voice . &quot;
&quot; on the map audio there is an setting speed . so this works , the program SO@@ x installed and will be able to un@@ load over the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zer@@ os such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the talk speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read ( this is in mind that the HTML in SS@@ ML ) is converted . ( see ) or if you &apos;re very brave , change the .x@@ sl file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to the SS@@ ML file format , and set the talk speed up . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t make it to read that websites with a female voice . I set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . this festival makes no mistakes , the X@@ SL file conver@@ ts to converting SS@@ ML according to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags . same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added any own drawing filters , and now I can go back in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more sat@@ in or go back . on the Kart@@ ei@@ re@@ ite orders will appear , the order stand only from a sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question , sign sign , comm@@ a and semi @-@ ik@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter . use for these characters instead a filter for pro@@ positi@@ onal detection . &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.7 or later . note : make sure that the modules are registered for G@@ Stre@@ amer by using the use of G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stre@@ amer@@ .@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org )
&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in the audio output . if your system is also counted , you can not play music simultaneously and launch a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; free@@ zes on the website of this problem , you can find possible solutions for this issue on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support real breaks yet . if you keep a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current proposition will be read yet . &quot;
&quot; the audio program SO@@ x is used for the general setting of speaking speed , but otherwise it is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install SO@@ x with the command apt @-@ get install SO@@ x . the program is already included in most &amp; Linux ; CDs already . &quot;
&quot; have you downloaded &amp; kt@@ ts , as a tar@@ ball ( with tar pack@@ et archive ) , sign up as normal users and un@@ packing the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4 will be removed the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least still created on request .
&quot; the following modules for voice syn@@ thesizer are created by default . some of them have a run @-@ time depen@@ dency of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free after the de@@ bug of the Deb@@ ian distribution ) , the configure parameters will display the configure parameters that causes the transition to the outcome . &quot;
&quot; as default , &amp; kt@@ ts ; in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 installed . is this folder not listed in the ambient variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you have to specify an option --@@ pre@@ fix = target . &quot;

&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ops , please check first if your language syn@@ thesizer works correctly . follow the instructions you have received with the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally well , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices you can set lou@@ dness , speaking speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
you need to install at least one language . help to find in the instructions that will be delivered with festival . want to read websites to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone .
&quot; for these voices , you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code from the festival . the German voices are subject to limitations . &quot;
&quot; this voice sets the festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early development stage . un@@ zip the software in the festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / Russian / . if you enter the Russian voices , you must type a C@@ yr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions , search the festival as the first on the CDs of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding must be set to a 8 @-@ bit C@@ yr@@ illi@@ c like KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; then the le@@ x@@ ik@@ al analysis and &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; generates from it the audio output . the &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; -@@ Program and the &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from

select a voice and put the paths to &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o right .
&quot; epic syn@@ thesizer is a free , qu@@ eri@@ ff language syn@@ thesizer for the Czech and Slovak language . it is a simple language syn@@ thesizer with yet sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can adjust the volume at this language syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; start kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr . on the card speaker click on , select the c@@ zech or Slov@@ ak@@ ian language and ep@@ s T@@ TS @-@ language syn@@ thesizer . if the ep@@ ox@@ s programs are not in your P@@ AT@@ H you can enter any additional parameter for the programs . specify in a &amp; console ; Epo@@ s -@@ h or say -@@ h , to get more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ ad language syn@@ thesizer which has been written in &amp; Java , i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java , neither sound height , noise , noise speed . &quot;
command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any language syn@@ thesizer which can be controlled in a &amp; console ; on the command line .
&quot; best use a command that writes the language output into a temporary audio file ( wav ) , instead of sending the output directly to audio equipment . &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; control center , which allows the management of network interfaces , routine and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; allows users to manage a range of systems and desktop settings via a unified , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K Menu k@@ control@@ center . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ control@@ center will be displayed . the network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched by selection of k@@ control@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in the &amp; k@@ menu . &quot;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers have already been installed and configured to display &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device is possible at all and allows the setting of network properties .
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed in installing &amp; Linux ; installed and set up . network appliances later added , the drivers must be loaded on the following files , according to the kernel release : &quot;
the module network settings will be loaded when the network settings in the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; -@@ Index is chosen . when starting the module &apos;s network settings the system used to automatically detect the platform on the system automatically .
&quot; if the platform can &apos;t be detected , the hanging selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to select the distribution and release date the best . by setting the setting , it can be set automatically set automatically . at the next start of the network settings , this selection will be pre@@ set automatically . &quot;
&quot; change the network settings are possible only in system management mode . previously , all options are depicted , which means that settings can only be viewed , the change mode can be viewed at the right bottom end of the module . it is the input of the password required . &quot;
the module &apos;s functionality is available in system management mode . this is divided into three hor@@ semen :
the tab network interface serves to manage the system &apos;s network appliances . all available network appliances are displayed . from the tab network interfaces the following tasks can be performed :
&quot; the settings requested network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list , and click the button interface ... in the dialog device . &quot;
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . Click the button , click the dialog with more detailed possibilities . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of Autom@@ atically , TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings will be required for the system at the same time . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system . &quot;
&quot; with the selection manu@@ ell , the TCP / IP address can be performed without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is highlighted , the system initi@@ ates the network interface during bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values given in this dialog are displayed as features of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . you can determine whether the address address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network appliances can be activated or switched off . switch @-@ off network device is accessed by selecting from the list and click Interface ....
network appliances can be activated or off if required . switch off a activated network device is accessed by selecting from the list and click Interface .
&quot; puts the IP address of the host in local sub@@ net , which is convey@@ ed to the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ networks . &quot;
&quot; if on computer there is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network in which the Gateway computer is selected . &quot;
&quot; a machine with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers may only understand IP addresses . if the calcul@@ ator htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS trig@@ gers these names in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the calcul@@ ator for the name resolution part of the e@@ quest@@ rian name solution enables an easy administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS entries can be ordered by selecting a contract , or dis@@ gra@@ dation in the list with buttons or under the priority . &quot;
&quot; by clicking button adding ... from the host machine to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . the dialog New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ vers can be added . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button to add . the entry is inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group calcul@@ ator for name resolution , select one entry and then click on button . it will display the dialog . &quot;
&quot; the list of famous hosts describes the name @-@ to @-@ IP address adjustment for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily by bo@@ oting , when no DNS servers are available . in small , remote networks it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
usually the list contains some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses will support . this is still in the test of the new version of IP to replace in the future version 4 .
&quot; enter the IP address of the well @-@ known machine , and click to add .... The dialog New also will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the well @-@ known host and click the button . if the famous host has several alias name , kno@@ b button add several times and enter the other alias name . &quot;
select one entry of a well @-@ known machines from the list and select Edit .... The dialog box is displayed .
&quot; it can be done one of the following tasks , then by clicking OK , the list of static hosts is updated . &quot;
&quot; settings made in the module settings are not effective immediately . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be removed . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf website is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net to download the latest version of the source code .
&quot; for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) , it is enough when &amp; K@@ DE ; and Q@@ t installed . &quot;
&quot; the installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply the rpm package to download and install in a &amp; console ; with rpm , as follows : &quot;
&quot; alternatively , a tool with graphic interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of their distribution can be used . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE is sufficient for this case ; but additionally , the development meetings with libraries and others are needed . &quot;
&quot; this is only recommended to comp@@ ile users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to comp@@ ile the following commands . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information on fundamental network technology will be given , in the second , all &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf configuration file will be discussed . &quot;
this area can &apos;t replace remote knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PCs into a small ( home ) network are medi@@ ated .
&quot; currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv4 ) . this description is never expected to spread over the future . this description focuses on the widespread IPv4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge that IP address of a network interface is . in foreign networks , am &amp; eg ; workplace administrator is the response station that can be used a valid IP address , or if available , the IP address can not be chosen either . &quot;
&quot; when replacing a very small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specially reserved area to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded on the Internet , so it is possible to use any use . &quot;
&quot; of course , the access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting of a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , usually addresses are used in the range of 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 255.@@ 255.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so all computers are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the default route is required for the IP for@@ warding . &quot;
the net@@ address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine . usually the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
&quot; in this part , configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; sometimes this file will sometimes change dynam@@ ically in DSL connections , so it is not surprised when in the case of active DSL connections , it is a different content to be found there . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config , which can therefore be found as expected . &quot;

&quot; it appears the standard K@@ DE ; print dialog . if you select , check that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in print dialog . &quot;
prints the cr@@ ont@@ ab of all users on the system . this option is accessible only for users to possess advanced per@@ missions .
cr@@ on for example vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; cr@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command cr@@ ont@@ ab to change the tim@@ et@@ ables of the user .
&quot; a PO@@ S@@ IX @-@ compliant &amp; UNIX ; , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands of &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a coll@@ ision programme for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create several archives on a tape . the second goal was to provide a question for tar that my wife did : how much longer will it take , how much longer will it take ? &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be tied by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done on three ways : &quot;
&amp; k@@ dat ; trained the band back and reads the pre @-@ ten@@ sion@@ ing information of the band . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t know if the band will be form@@ at@@ ted whether the band should be form@@ at@@ ted .
&quot; recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the Vor@@ sp@@ ell , looking for the appropriate index on your plate . can not be found , you will be asked if the band@@ index should be created ane@@ w . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , changes the symbol for the tape drive to indicate that the band is integrated . in the Status Bar an appropriate message appears . the contents of the band can now be searched for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before taking the tape , first the integration must be solved . there are three methods to do this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; can be seen by a change of symbol for the band , that the integration of the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the Status Bar . the band can now be kicked out without any danger . &quot;
&quot; before a band of &amp; k@@ dat , can be used , it must be form@@ at@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ; &quot;
&quot; a band types must be form@@ at@@ ted before you can use data stored at &amp; k@@ dat ; this process is not necessary to format use &amp; k@@ dat ; normally your tape drives must be form@@ at@@ ted before using the tape of &amp; k@@ dat ; however , this procedure may not be form@@ at@@ ted before using the tape drives , DA@@ T drives , however . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat , with the format of the band . all data on the tape is lost ! after completion of the form@@ att@@ ing process the band is automatically integrated , and is ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you encounter the backup process , you &apos;ll need to select the c@@ auti@@ ous files . it can be done on three ways : &quot;
select one file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or file is secured .
mark a safety profile in the tree . only the profile specified in the profile are secured .
mark files in local file @-@ tree with a ham@@ lets . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder are secured .
&quot; with the right mouse button , click on the local file tree and select in the Settings menu ... &quot;
&quot; once the backup was initiated , the dialog settings for backup . in this dialog you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears : the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
mark a file or folder in one of the archives in entry for the drive . only the selected file or the folder was checked .
mark the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a Hä@@ k@@ chen . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder are checked .
&quot; with the right mouse button , click one of the archives and select the menu arrangement .... &quot;
&quot; once the testing procedure was started , the dialog settings will appear for verification . in this dialog , you can check your selection and change the work file for checking . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialog appears to review . this dialogue shows the progress of the test process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can open the restart , the files must be re@@ produced , selected . this can be done on two types : &quot;
&quot; select one file , or file in one of the archives that belong to entry for tape drive . only the selected file or sub @-@ folders will be restored . &quot;
mark the desired files from one of the archives with a Hä@@ k@@ chen . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder are restored .
&quot; with the right mouse button , click into one file , or file in one of the archives and select in the menu . &quot;
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialog settings for restoration . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the work file for restoration . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog appears to restore . this dialogue shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remainder of time . &quot;
sometimes it has been considered necessary to create the band inde@@ x@@ al file using the band content . this process is extingu@@ ished all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two kinds of tape :
&quot; in this context , a safety profile is created with the straight selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a safety profile : &quot;
&quot; the current working folder , in which the backup should be done . the list of the c@@ auti@@ ous files will be updated automatically , according to the chosen work file . &quot;
&quot; for all folders that are listed under backup files , only the files are stored on the same file system , as the folder . folders that are on the same file system , can be used separately on other file systems . each entry is considered by tar ir@@ respective of the others . &quot;
&quot; perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last in@@ cre@@ ment@@ ary backup , a snap@@ shot file is secured . only the files will have changed since then . &quot;
&quot; the name of the file , which is used to determine the changes since the last in@@ cre@@ ment@@ ary backup . &quot;
del@@ etes the snap@@ shots before the call of tar . this causes all files secured and create a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; lt ; files was not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can read the settings via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the menu settings . the following settings can be done :
the full path to device file for tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ building variant of the band device .
&quot; this setting is activated , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is tied to the drive . for some drives this is necessary to be done before reading or writing operations . &quot;
&quot; the option is turned on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; to un@@ lock the throw at the tape drive . possibly this attitude will not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , the inser@@ tion of the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically cast the band . use this option not at Flo@@ ppy streaming . &quot;
&quot; the option is switched on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware @-@ sided block size for tape drives . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you have to tell &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case , you need to tell &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case , the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band form@@ at@@ ted , writing a file at the beginning of the Ban@@ des . this file should only take a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( n byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is the name : seconds , whereby the host name is the complete name of the system , on which the band has been form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that has been form@@ at@@ ted since the era . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file using the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure tar - archives , which can operate directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar - even other tar versions should work , as long as it is not for incre@@ mental f@@ uses . &quot;
check the content of a backup association . this symbol is only active when a band is integrated .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ blog log ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; Viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users where you can get information about your system or where the system allows you to get information about your system . moreover , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; experienced users provides quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer makes in background . the task is suitable for un@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can get information about your system or where the system is deposited on the various protocol files .
&quot; furthermore , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log enables an experienced access to information about problems which appear on their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log , therefore tries to provide some extended functions , with which help the protocol files may be filtered and evaluated . &quot;
&quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log has a number of useful functions . these include : &quot;
&quot; support for many different log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included also and are explained in the other chapters of this hand@@ book .
&quot; as you see in the following screen photo , see &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; functions are available , with which help the individual protocol @-@ lines of a protocol file easily filter and sort . individual options for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this hand@@ book . &quot;
&quot; after start trying &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log , initially the main protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will not be displayed , so you will not have a small message window , so you can see &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; very likely do not have with system @-@ run right . the protocol files will usually have no permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter on a selected crit@@ eri@@ on or after specified strings . the list of the log lines will now be changed automatically , so that only log lines will appear in the default settings . in the default settings the protocol line will only be displayed , when in one of the columns of the filter search engine is included . &quot;
&quot; you can also select another record at this point . for example , select the filter search engine will then only select the entries in the selected columns , and apply it in the filter platform the name of one process , so show you &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; all protocol lines were sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is activated in the default setting and helps you recognize the important protocol lines . protocol @-@ lines of the level error are displayed with a striking color as a protocol @-@ lines of the stage indication . the color display of protocol lines can be switched off .
&quot; if you want to show a process of process ( for example , in the protocol protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , you can then be useful if you would like to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use the filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can activate the option to new lines jump in the context menu of the main window to display all new next Protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log , allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ types . to open this feature , use the entries in the window to open up and manage an additional sub@@ window , select in the menu a protocol to display . &quot;

&quot; welcome to the &amp; K@@ DE ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section carries some concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the V In@@ it system quickly develops to the standard for controlling the start @-@ up of the system in the &amp; Linux ; therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful , and more flexible than the traditional BSD input . &quot;
I &apos;m not going to go on to historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it itself : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it bin@@ aries is below / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because perhaps someone could try to implement a machine on System V In@@ it , without a re@@ installation and re@@ form@@ att@@ ing . that &apos;s why you need to be sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was there . &quot;
&quot; the SY@@ S@@ V In@@ it also diff@@ ers by BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . d@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders : &quot;
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for every system service , which you want to run at the high speed of the system or when changing to another run@@ level . system services include such things such as set@@ ail , which is only once rest@@ art@@ ed . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should go on one hand under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you need it . most systems have this file , even if it &apos;s not much use for it . you can also want to run a r@@ c.@@ c in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something to do with the serial connection . &quot;
&quot; the kernel searches for various positions according to the program in@@ it , and starts the first one that he finds . &quot;
the standard run@@ level is registered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see in the beginning area a line like the following :
&quot; at this point you can dis@@ card a look into the second column and probably realize that the pre @-@ set run@@ level 3 is necessary . if you would like to change that , then you can fix / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab of hand and change the 3 . if you want to change something , then you can restart the system and run the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does all the right scripts start ? if you enter -@@ l enter into r@@ c@@ 3 , then you will probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d . &quot;
how does it start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts are written so it is an argument like start and stop accepted . you can actually start scripts by hand on the command line like this :
&quot; this would have the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it includes a K , the script will stop with the argument . if it includes a S , the script will be called by the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could run &amp; eg ; a server @-@ level , which can only run htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; also , I could even have a user @-@ run ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts . &quot;
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is easy to say not tri@@ vial : just pull one entry from the area of availability system services to one of the six Run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within a level by changing it elsewhere . this is done only if they get a record from the area of availability system services .
&quot; note : entries are moved , if you pull them into a new range . in order to edit it into a new run@@ level , you have to explicitly select copying from the menu Edit , and then add to the target range -- even if the same entry exists in the target range of action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of a entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the converted entries before you can try to insert the system service . &quot;
note : currently there is no possibility to restore entries in the tr@@ ash . be careful .
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ulator key to activate the different work areas ( dispos@@ ition system services , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection of upper or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to move one entry into another lap , move it into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change sorting order or change the name of a entry manually , press the input button to open the properties dialog . connect the tab@@ ulator button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to dis@@ card the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they will be saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; otherwise they will be saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard lap of Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine starts constantly . what can I do ? &quot;
&quot; enter the li@@ lo -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single nut@@ shell mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default Run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) . &quot;
I provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; to run under run@@ level X but they are not executed .
&quot; if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc which are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the species , such as system services in these distri@@ butions , will be simplified the configuration for proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but is unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use another distribution , please check whether all configuration files are present , which are required by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) are simply un@@ furnished without news if your configuration files are not available or false . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about Run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ;
&quot; after you have made changes , you must save them . either use the appropriate symbol of tool@@ bars or entry to save in the menu . &quot;
&quot; user user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , user and user groups . for editing , select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user or group characteristics . &quot;
&quot; some flash@@ cards are displayed only if you have extended system settings . only if you can use extended system settings ( Qu@@ ota ) , a map card can be produced on which you can make individual settings , if shadow passwords or example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d can be installed as in BSD applications . &quot;
&quot; the map password is released , if Shadow passwords or example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d can be installed as in BSD applications . &quot;
&quot; this cardboard card is only activated , if it is enabled for at least a embedded file system ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ zable at the file name user / quot@@ as group on the file system ) . here , there can be no parameters for each user : &quot;
&quot; for each fil@@ esystem , these parameters can be set individually . the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system . &quot;
&quot; the card groups inform@@ s groups of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , you will find in the Pri@@ mary Group . furthermore , the user can mark in other groups by creating this in the big field . &quot;
dialog properties of the Group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group select this user in the list .
&quot; to add a user or a group , select from the menu user or group or click the matching button button of the tool@@ bar . editing or delete the selected user or the selected group works analogue . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the li@@ lo Boot@@ manager , remove the boot word , remove and change the boot time to the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , change operating system , change , change , and more . &quot;
