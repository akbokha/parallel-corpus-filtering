<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but produces particularly in dark areas, grainy pictures."</seg>
<seg id="481">"unsharpness mask works on the contrast of the edges by a picture. actually, it is not a bit, it is rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it makes a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and he is protected by copyright protected by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">"it is perhaps the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its use and has different parameters to adapt."</seg>
<seg id="483">"photos without focus as well as most digitised images need a correction of the sharpness. this is also a little bit spoilt for the resolution, so the same phenomenon can be watching a little bit spoiled. SLR cameras will usually take more dynamic sharpening as normal cameras for the private user."</seg>
<seg id="484">JPEG pictures often have a camera internal sharpening. images in rough format has to always be sharpened in the processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanner turn a sharpness filter already during the read of the image. if you disable this, you get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get usable results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening range of sharpening. this can be sharpening with the menu entry."</seg>
<seg id="487">"but you should get careful, as the results do not seem very natural: sharpening the sharpness of the edges, but enhances also the noise. in general, you can achieve further information on sharpening of a picture. in general, you can find further information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">"sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution, the image is a little soft to draw. use the tool to softer with the menu entry, and experiment with settings. the front window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter is unsharp masked is a very good tool to remove mucus from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview can help edit the image. the front window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values often generate good results and should be tested first. an increase of the radius or amount increases the effect. if you generate the sharpest mask, you will create noise and the impression of grate in the vicinity of sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is how many pixels are affected on each side of an edge through the filters. high-resolution images allow bigger radii. they should therefore use pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wired images added to the original. this will be the strength of the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the swelling value is a fraction of the maximum RGB values, and the difference amount. you can therefore define a minimum difference thus for a cannon of filters. in this way, areas with a soft change between the tones of sharks and therefore beauty errors are avoided."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the unsharp masked filter. the original picture is the (1) and the revised image (2). unsharp masked was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swellvalue = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digiate; tool Refocus is focused on a picture through improvement of the sharpness. it used the copyright-protected unfissure filter algorithm with Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to hit a picture of & quot; focussed enlisted; in which it is better approach to sharpening the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese Filing. it is used to focus better results than insharp masked. you can launch it from the menu by calling colors Refocus in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular fash works much better than the Gauss's fission, which leads the mathematical result also by the source pixies, which is far off from the original quellent pixel. the FIR Viennese Inverse is even very strongly influenced by distant pixels. causing unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the most important parameters for the use of the module. it is the most important parameters for the use of this module. for most pictures should be the default value 1 good results. but you can set a higher value if your image should be very unsharp but then to Heiligenschan.</seg>
<seg id="500">"Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpest effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filters: an increase of noise filters can help you reduce artifacts. however, values improve from 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 is very bad. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very bad. a high value is the image even further."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for Gauß's sharpness. use this parameter if your unsharpened usp is caused. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts, so you may also increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"mat size: this value determined the size of the transformer-size. an increase in mat size can generate good results, especially if you select big values for the circular edge or the Gauss's sharpness. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">Store the store and store buttons are used exactly on this purposes. every re-focused parameters that you have set it will be saved for later and can be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try out all accessory, color and intensity activity on the image before you use the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not immediately visible, but later leave unpleasant artifacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you read pictures and compressed, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, unsharp masked produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by inevitating a larger neighborhood as sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically it must always be masked to create artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never be the effect of the unsharpness. practical, the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the unsharpened mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better with the processing of small details."</seg>

<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter is concerned bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3."</seg>

<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these defects. in general pictures with this feature is better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">"when you turn anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is super sampling."</seg>

<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for Red, Green and Blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for Red, Green and Blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -b 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixel, which can be checked individually and checked further on further subdivision. the maximum depth of the Recursion can be adjusted to the depth value."</seg>

<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and derived compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for additional parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium' = This setting gives good transparency to most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">"--preset Standard '= This setting should usually offer for most people and most of the music's acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for stereo-stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for stereo-stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice."</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approximately 5.5. always needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for stereo-stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and car-stereotypes. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you necessarily have the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"the & CD; information, manually typed or by the program automatically collected from FreeDB by the program, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can transfer / used with & kaudioCreator; and to the code name, as well as the properties of the music files."</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with co-programs there is often a combination of program settings for the Kodierer and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the Kodierern explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example, to add the & CD; title to the keyword (English: day) add if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt from lame and the title parameter of & kaudioCreator; added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudioCreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"that is what the FreeDB is: a free database, in which persons can read the audio CDs you can download, so that all other information can be downloaded from yourself into the calculator: & CD; title, artist, names of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file himself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal, but I (address of Ueberaster: that is the author) I'm not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent from the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither can neither the artist can be added to the music business. all information can be done by a Bumblebee through a & CD; business, physical or virtual."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"in & kaudioCreator; it is active as an address to choose (sending an address). for the use of FreeDB can be used in the system. in this type of configuration, it seems, the e-mail address will not be used for retrieving data from server (This can only know the programmer that has checked the code.)"</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there are in many countries copies of the main database. if & kaudioCreator, used by FreeDB, the geographical branch will be used on the next level. this saves bandwidth in the network, and compares the load between the machines."</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org offers a current list of mirror servers for online check from & CD; information about reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually monthly) only the updates of the database. "</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which read program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to store in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">"there are rumors that cdparanoia is used, who wants to be more precise, search in source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; see to note that the cdparanoia package from the matching distribution must be installed first if this is not yet."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"for storing the selected WAV files, the code reader can be selected for the desired file format. for the first opening, pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compressing for audio data) can be added to the code tab on this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the code is used. this is also necessary for predefined codierer. more information about Kodierer in chapter Welter Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installation of a code, further information on its switch will be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). 'lame' will be replaced by the name of the installed Kodierers."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"this can have many causes. check the setup of the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and readers of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;), try to give both programs with a command line in a terminal."</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the shell & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step for step example. even if you use other settings can give this tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">"have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are still unsafe anything to do? well, no problem, follow this step-for-step example, and you'll get enough information to set those areas that make the program exactly what you want."</seg>

<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the balance sheet is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right order (from 0 to 127), you cannot change the order and do not leave any line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all the sounds that this instrument is using the number M. if your keyboard does not support a tissue (e.g. with sound 60), you can do the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>

<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the phrase patch patch of the patch is meant, with which any tone represents another percussionist instrument (drum, cymbals, Maracas & etc;) and not the one, with which the tone the pitch of the same drum means (like him possess some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">"the KEYMAP section is used to specify, as notes on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:"</seg>
<seg id="1667">"like the PATCHMAP section the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. you need to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keyboards for each channel and each instrument. you just need to use different names in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to form tones on the perkets channel. look at the supplied keyboards as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to convert some channels to others. if you want to convert the first and the second channel, make it simply in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>

<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed, because GM will present a keyboard that is supposed to play a tone higher with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, some keyboards generally try to play up to a octave higher. to try the correct value on your keyboard, you have to try a little bit with & kmid;"</seg>

<seg id="1679">"you can also use the canalview to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a select list where you can select a instrument. if you have changed a instrument, the button is no longer green but red, to indicate that no more the original instrument is used."</seg>

<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about it, like a piece of music. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc. that can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes on very different ways."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I cannot force anybody, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything."</seg>

<seg id="2083">"global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; uses, available. of toolbars over actions is all that is marked as global, in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure various toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree which is available to each in a multi-user environment."</seg>
<seg id="2084">"local items represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local items are stored in the user directory, so they can only use this user personally."</seg>
<seg id="2085">"project-related elements are available only within a specific project. this can be done with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply said, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder and patterns of all employees within the project."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"the & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the construction sector, the cartons with info and the toolbars. please strike in, and further information on these areas."</seg>
<seg id="2087">"you can click the carton button with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as close the current, other or all Karteireite, re-loading, delete or upload of the document, jump to a bookmarks or execution of CVS commands to the current document."</seg>
<seg id="2088">"legal action in the editor can lead to another context menu regarding the processed document content, such as basic processing steps (cut / copy / paste), edit the file under the mouse pointer or open the file, if the string is named under the mouse pointer."</seg>
<seg id="2089">"at the top end of the Editorfensters there are the tool bar of the editor. at the moment, & Ds, 4.01 Transitional will be shown as standard, for which a set of toolbars will be shown. in the course of the further expansion of toolbars, the toolbars will be adapted to the new functions and thus associated user needs."</seg>
<seg id="2090">"the use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single day, e.g. & lt; then click the symbol that represents the tag, then you can add the data for that just one day. if you want to insert several attributes (such as anchor), you can add to a dialog different fields."</seg>
<seg id="2091">"important perspectives (QIT;) allow to navigate in the information about & quantaplus; to navigate, to open and push through. in representation with Karteireders are available for files, project, sample positions, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation of construction purposes."</seg>
<seg id="2092">"project Management is a powerful tool that provides & quantitative tool. this view shows all files in the project and allows the managing the files in the project via right click. actions such as add, remove, upload or delete files from the storage medium can be performed with the displayed counter menu."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"another option of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, program parts, a whole website & etc; there are all possibilities open."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; working range. global templates are always available, local templates are only available for the respective users and templates. more to templates is available."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"here you can find information about the available script languages. the concept of a breakdown in Global, Local and Project works here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can easily retrieve the information on a script. via the right mouse button you can start to edit or send by email."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with this view, one displays the internal structure of the active document. through left-click of an element, the cursor is set to the position of the element. by right-click of an element opens a list of commands in terms of navigation and collection of the tree."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"this tree appears under the other construction sector. with it, manfast attributes and namespaces can change. that's possible to change the contents of all the attributes with a few clicks."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development. you can download documentation for & quantaplus; it can be downloaded, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited, edited and viewed."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"by default, & quantaplus; two carteivers at the lower end of the window can be reached: the message window and the problem window."</seg>
<seg id="2100">"this Karteireite displays information about each in Quanta running script. for example, the DTD uses the current document and all changes to DTD."</seg>
<seg id="2101">This Karteireite shows all errors in the market up of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed will give all error messages (as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are expanded and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and it is given the corresponding command. the chocolate stores of toolbars is the opportunity to define their own commands as symbols in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2103">A further feature of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with an e-mail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed Tar-Archive via & kmail; if you have a toolbar in an e-mail you can secure them in & quantaplus; like any other unloading and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">"it is reasonable if you want to adapt the place of & quantaplus; you can get a number of options that can be delivered to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here."</seg>

<seg id="2950">This option is activated in the default setting and helps you recognize the important protocol lines. protocol-lines of the level error are displayed with a striking color as a protocol-lines of the stage indication. the color display of protocol lines can be switched off.</seg>

<seg id="2959">"the Init binaries is below / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because perhaps someone could try to implement a machine on System V Init, without a reinstallation and reformatting. that's why you need to be sure that the old Init was removed from there, if there was there."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SYSV Init also differs by BSD Init, that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for every system service, which you want to run at the high speed of the system or when changing to another runlevel. system services include such things such as setail, which is only once restarted. such calls belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should go on one hand under / etc / rc.d, if you need it. most systems have this file, even if it's not much use for it. you can also want to run a rc.c in / etc / rc.d if you want to run something to do with the serial connection."</seg>

<seg id="2964">The standard runlevel is registered in / etc / inittab. you should see in the beginning area a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point you can discard a look into the second column and probably realize that the pre-set runlevel 3 is necessary. if you would like to change that, then you can fix / etc / inittab of hand and change the 3. if you want to change something, then you can restart the system and run the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does all the right scripts start? if you enter -l enter into rc3, then you will probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d."</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts are written so it is an argument like start and stop accepted. you can actually start scripts by hand on the command line like this:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would have the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it includes a K, the script will stop with the argument. if it includes a S, the script will be called by the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could run & eg; a server-level, which can only run httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; also, I could even have a user-run; & kdm;, network & etc; starts."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Use & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is easy to say not trivial: just pull one entry from the area of availability system services to one of the six Runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
