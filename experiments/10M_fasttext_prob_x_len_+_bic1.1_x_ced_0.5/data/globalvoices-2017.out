although I visited the US at least once a year since 2012 I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love of America is extremely great .
&quot; like many of my generation , I grew up with American films , I have read American music , read American authors and operated its sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had a very profound effect on me that I was mainly because of a American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican Letter , who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura @-@ Student , who had the Supreme Court of Justice to occupy its interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free after technique Man , &quot; I was it , as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year that I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only intensi@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country where I ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting you to be that you are always and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equality people . &quot;
I even had a very slim love letter concerning his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
a lot was written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is to me as he goes with his narrow @-@ minded man .
&quot; in his opinion , he never stops behind the mountain , how to say so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague express it , and openly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ american and Women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people have re@@ acted on his testimony , and agreed in dro@@ ves for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes , which he won by the Republi@@ can pre @-@ election , was the highest number formed by the Party of nominated candidate . &quot;
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ gi@@ ate person I asked myself ?
I could not get tr@@ ump and his elec@@ torate in harmony with the people whom I met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; as for example , my Professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , takes people out of all over the world , a deep believing man , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps , too , did not agree with the present editor of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met our common love for basketball and we spent a lot of hours with the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; to watch the game .
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps int@@ oler@@ ance also stands in contrast to gener@@ osity , which I experienced in Sandy B@@ ahr , who had her life in the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; still it fits to the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and arro@@ gan@@ ce , and my colleagues helped to acc@@ use us to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose supporters helped me much in my career . &quot;
these people and those by they em@@ bodied my love in America .
&quot; during Tr@@ ump in his way to the nominated Republi@@ can Presidential candidate , she offered me a stop and the counterpart on its limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on November 8 , 2016 , more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presidency of a man , despite - or maybe because of its cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ frontation with the idea that humans have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they were either shared on rac@@ ism and Fan@@ at@@ ism , or because they were prepared to over@@ look these things , almost the heart broke me . &quot;
perhaps it is un@@ fair to call Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as ra@@ assi@@ sts .
&quot; to arrange the people , one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is superf@@ ici@@ ally and respec@@ t@@ less and imp@@ lies an in@@ ability to understand those who act on a different way and think .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about hec@@ tic changes in their municipalities can not be considered .
&quot; could it be that those voters , of whom are most white , have voted for Tr@@ ump because they want control over a country that she has disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
perhaps perhaps .
&quot; however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who commenting on the cruel decision to lift up a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t of those who look differently than he . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( 1020 m . : as much as &quot; re@@ jection of white against all other eth@@ nic@@ ities &quot; ; vocabulary of white in playing on the white and whi@@ ch@@ ash , as it means the big Van Jones , did exactly what America did so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether the myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which belief or background you may have always , America is called every welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as his pre@@ sidents , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ an@@ ers , whose history , as he says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; with the election of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , a huge part of the white America &apos;s promise is on it and says , &quot; &quot; hell with complexity , religious freedom and all the concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in the Americas , after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the ru@@ dder , they say . &quot;
&quot; at all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
on a rally for Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn had a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan asked . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; he filled the crowd .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they called them , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if anyone , who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan decided in words , &quot; &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is not your America . &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son fell , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; now , this is Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , said the message . &quot;
&quot; all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could no longer find any place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks me my heart .

&quot; from the mis@@ ery to the stars : these Latin American children do not allow their love to music by rub@@ b@@ ish , &quot;
&quot; the Recy@@ cled Instruments Orchestra &quot; by Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC . &quot;

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero congregation in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean City Cat@@ e@@ ura together ?
&quot; the music that is played in both places is not only the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular with tourists , but worlds apart from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; since a couple of years now , the La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) plays in the congregation : one of children and adults of existing symph@@ ony orchestra , which has found their musical instruments an opportunity to overcome the negle@@ cted poverty . &quot;
a music school with 100 students became the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the municipality , located in one of the poorest provinces of Mex@@ ic@@ os , is known for their drugs abuse and ban@@ kers . &quot;
but after a random meeting with a French pilot who launched a musical project and the youth had always offered a rare hope of hope .
&quot; young band members take their obligations towards the music group very serious , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI , writes : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from the school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they are always laugh@@ ing and with shining eyes and play in the tru@@ sty you learn day for day trumpet , trombone , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , o@@ boe , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from rub@@ b@@ ish
&quot; more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village located at the top of the largest land@@ fill of As@@ unci@@ on in the capital city - on instruments made from recy@@ cle waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with restored instruments made from local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycling under supervision of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez had begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate violin , viola , C@@ elli , double b@@ asses , gu@@ itars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , trumpet and percussion . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire comprises classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music by Beatles , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o Chávez , a local o@@ est@@ ologist and musical teachers of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , at the starting time : &quot;
&quot; first it was very difficult because we had no space for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place , the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children . &quot;
&quot; that changed when F@@ avi@@ o was something that he had never seen before , a violin @-@ produced violin . &quot;
&quot; today , there is an entire orchestra which plays on instruments of re@@ prepared material and is called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ical gar@@ bage dump ) shows the musical performance on :
the world generates about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish every year .
&quot; those who with him and from him live their anger , as people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational play from gar@@ bage @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra played music even before Pope Francis :
these Eastern African countries show how technology and team@@ work successfully fight the illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that the wild illeg@@ itim@@ ate fishing fights .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that targeted on international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices , it will happen in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; in West Africa , this ship was already known that this ship was already operating in the Liberia waters of illegal fishing , before reaching the other coast of Africa . &quot;
&quot; in this regard , the East African countries were brought up and slightly til@@ ted , the crimin@@ als of this species to be welcomed into its coasts . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ ors , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobi@@ lized rapidly against the ship . they refused to give him one of their har@@ bours and refused to give him a fishing permit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything &quot; , &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior executive of the Ken@@ yan fishing agency . he is part of a team that discovered the ship and followed . &quot;
in 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it wasn &apos;t able to catch fish there .
&quot; ultimately , there was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars on Liberia because of pill@@ aging the country &apos;s stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which protects against criminal practices and protects resources , F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO stop illeg@@ ally F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) was founded . &quot;
&quot; the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries that had been exp@@ elled from their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; thus , we have eight countries that are the same and work together . they exchange information and stand out each other where it &apos;s about illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally F@@ ishing . this project offers technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is captured , is hidden , because it is extremely difficult for it . this is illegal fishing a major cause of over@@ fishing regions . &quot;
&quot; due to the deliber@@ ate abuse of existing laws , by which specific habit@@ ats and species should be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems may harm a del@@ ic@@ ates equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um . &quot;
&quot; but while the action against illegal fishing was once hin@@ dered by bureaucr@@ atic obstacles and also by the snow@@ sho@@ ot@@ emp@@ o , with the information from individual countries , these actions do not happen in real time , with tra@@ ce@@ able on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there you can inter@@ fere with each other , for example , lists existing licenses , news to susp@@ icious activities or details that you noticed during a port inspection or experienced . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive , when moving around in the open sea , with satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to identify ships that can fish in forbidden areas . even so susp@@ icious riding routes can be discovered , such that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations can show whether the involved ships have a fishing licence where they were on the way and possibly , whether they have a criminal . &quot;
&quot; countries who are against illegal fishing , can then deny the acceptance of such ships in their ports . what means that the ships can &apos;t sell their load in their ports , as in the case of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about significant financial losses in the owners , meaning that illegal fishing is fin@@ anci@@ ally worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , senior director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a mountain firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to back up an estimated 20 million USD in lost sales , which lose the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i each year due to illegal fishermen , penet@@ rate in East African waters . &quot;
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing tra@@ ilers around the world and attracts the region &apos;s commercial fish@@ eries . this is also the same as illegal fishermen .
&quot; among other things , actions include actions such as sailing under false flag , fake licens@@ ing documents , identi@@ fying identi@@ fying species and fishing in nature areas . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they take advantage of the missing international cooperation and make the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ mosquito control system &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; previously a ship could be illegal and a country could then say &apos; You must not run my harbour . &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &apos; and exactly this legal conclusion tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i .
so far the closed front works .
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i participated in more than 30 examinations . &quot;
&quot; it has criminal media uncovered , which had been revealed to fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships which used several frau@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities and has found fle@@ dging ships . &quot;
&quot; due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency for com@@ b@@ ating crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information about illegal fishing over large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organizing crimes &quot; , &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot;
&quot; he builds a system that is to help F@@ ISH @-@ i , susp@@ icious ships in precise way . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always further developed , helps combat the illegal ships to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . and we are trying to cross @-@ cross , &quot; &quot; says Duncan Cop@@ eland , chef analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tra@@ cking , an NGO which also offers technical support and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , where@@ with they can no longer be operated by satellites . &quot;
&quot; Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that combines different information panels . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i helping to find criminal ships with larger precision . &quot;
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations do have influence on the un@@ question@@ ably global issue of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ ro Sky@@ Truth , believes this . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed in the world every single tra@@ ce@@ able ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; together with the neighbours , to get a better picture of it , who is doing what makes sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and bund@@ led their resources for investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run the persecution of ships . &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only feel crimin@@ als but they also deter them .
&quot; ships that previously f@@ ished without license were conf@@ ection@@ ed and hardly with consequences , now know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participated in F@@ ISH @-@ i participated in a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries , since then fishing boats can buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia helped , Gre@@ ko 1 found the inspec@@ tors there on board to@@ w nets , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries will also notice that achievement . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are a study object for several hundred million dollars annually through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , six countries have joined together , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . too , they now also fight the illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; with security , the aim is to bring more of such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country could report its first big triumph in Somalia : in October , it represented Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the way under false flag . and not only the ship was used without license and were used to to@@ w locks that are already banned . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also prohibited in forbidden waters , which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the Take of dimensional rules against Gre@@ ko 1 , it was a strong sign that they walk against illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence shows that such a special , collabor@@ ative occupational effort to protect the oceans actually work throughout the world . Emma Br@@ yce is freelance journalist and lives in London . there she writes about the environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , T@@ ED Education , the New York Times and in The Guardian . location in Venezuela continues to spread : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of conqu@@ ering the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seems to be only the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations .
they are considered protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum to the president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government &apos;s government rejected the motion of opposition to a referendum , the Venezuel@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes were the negotiations over the political and economic crisis in the country , having gathered themselves on the streets . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the withdrawal of Venezuela ) you can find pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate is also led in other parts of the country - among others in the Bar@@ inas region , in the An@@ den@@ regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central North to the federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ part@@ a . &quot;
the political and economic situation of the country deteri@@ or@@ ates continuously which makes itself noticeable in everyday life of Venezuel@@ ans through an acute lack of food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition participated in the official president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro took the chance for a basic change ; ultimately the holding of a re @-@ election was blocked by official authorities .
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises their latest articles in the context of government decision as follows : &quot;
&quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % ( annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ sufficient lack of food and medicine , the referendum was to be the only way to conquer its institutional structures and to close its institutional structures . &quot;
&quot; the election of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( approximately : round table of the Democratic Un@@ ity ) , demonstr@@ ators joined the opposition to the National Assembly as well as a march to the president of the National Assembly , and a march to the Mira@@ flo@@ res Palace , the Venezuel@@ an government , should continue to continue on the 27th of November . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :

especially great waves beat the news on police repression in the centr@@ alised town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; there the protest@@ ers return to the local cathedral , in order to protect themselves according to their own statement prior to the police and armed advoc@@ acy of the government . &quot;
&quot; hours later they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests went further . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including those woman in the An@@ den@@ state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;

&quot; meanwhile , an Inf@@ ographic will already make the round , which forms the magn@@ itude of oppression per day : &quot;
so the dictatorship was supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had asked the validity of demand following a minist@@ erial procedure - this was now demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of numerous people on the road .

&quot; this is a adap@@ tive version of an interview of Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the result of an Argentin@@ ean news page on 23 August 2016 . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced to see the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentine city of Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano said in the context of the Great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cordoba against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not seek his life .
&quot; starting with the burden , the same name as his father bear to carry up to the brutal military operation in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
he kept his family secret for 34 years .
&quot; in the time , I thought that it was fine . &quot;
I felt like a secret mag@@ ician .
as a child with 15 years you don &apos;t know that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
&quot; at that time , I was not able to recognize that my father was a thief , tort@@ ur@@ ers and mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a gendar@@ mer@@ its . during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism was his father from 1976 to 1978 , Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Service in the prison of La Per@@ la . &quot;

&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ x@@ ano , the oppressed , because of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and the ab@@ duction of a 10 year @-@ old child is charged . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who knew in the course of the years the extent of atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and he said before a Federal Court against his own father . &quot;
&quot; his story shows that great power has a parent over his child , and how this child chose a way of redemption . &quot;
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often walked with us in the sports hall . there I had been married with a young boy , the mar@@ tial art@@ y . &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and some days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
&quot; you are an ass@@ hole , you picked yourself with one of the ERP . &quot;
&quot; pass only that they will not take you one day , and I must save you . &quot;
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolutionary Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party . &quot;
&quot; therefore he banned me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he told me , I would be jeal@@ ous . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . because so my father loved me .
&quot; on the military base , I had to anni@@ hil@@ ate papers that heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; all possible documents : University closures , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ then the prisoners are tortured ...
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
&quot; during the first time and last time , he let me wait at the entrance in the car . &quot;
&quot; when he took me the second time he commanded me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small wrapped sleeve and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ump in silver . &quot;
&quot; on this day , I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen items were removed and stopped me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he interpreted to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured there .
&quot; I saw in , and saw a song tortured , tortured and tortured . &quot;
she looked like a field @-@ bed and metal springs .
later I found out that she was the end of a cab@@ el . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was just swe@@ pt there .
&quot; they caught a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , over@@ thrown him with water and pursued him a load of 220 volts to the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the place there was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty Win@@ del .
&quot; years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I recognized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I never forgot this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a man can do so much suffering from another ?
I knew that these people were killed &apos;
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were buried ; &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , a civilians who also was accused of the trial ) and I took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a range of matt@@ resses , on which naked people were standing with the face down - all were at hands and feet . &quot;
&quot; near the intervention , people silent on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What did you look like this , ass@@ hole ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I denied &quot; Why did you ever bring me ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and was buried by soldiers .
&quot; I know this , because my father told her home . &quot;
&quot; besides La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , several rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed another man .
&quot; according to the survivors of the civilian , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who also was indicted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , was charged to death by the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; the following video Emilio F@@ essi@@ a , head of the La Per@@ la memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
&quot; the road that you came in here , is also the way on which the kidn@@ apping came here . &quot;
&quot; when you see on the map , you see that they took about this track and tortured for the first time . &quot;
&quot; here , their names were changed and they were assigned as part of the process of relief a number . &quot;
&quot; when they survived the torture , prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came to be moved . &quot;
this was the lie - Eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of human beings and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War yield &apos;
my father gathered all the stolen things home .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; war yield &quot; - as they called it - was .
&quot; but when I was later by the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that war yield a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military signs which one attack against an enemy . &quot;

&quot; but if you go into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothes , painting , money ... ste@@ als , then that is no war yield but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I always asked how my father , the leader of security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I don &apos;t get it easy .
I was an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal it all in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a crime , and I said , You who steal your cars on the streets ? &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded against anger , struck me , and cried : &quot;
&quot; when you go so far , I will find you and you will be ad@@ fast . &quot;
we need no one else !
that was my father .
I have no only good memory of him .
&quot; as I said in the trial , I showed a photograph of that time , on which I wore a jacket and a roll swe@@ ater from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still made clothes home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defence accused me to be a mit@@ er in this crime . I answered , no problem , they can lay with me what they wanted . &quot;
&quot; anyway , I was there to say . &quot;
&apos; the disappearance of the dead is the last ab@@ hor@@ ous act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if one has only children , one knows the value of a life . &quot;
&quot; one develops , and realize that it is wrong to kill . &quot;
I even went to say so far :
&quot; well , you were ex@@ iled during the dictatorship of people . but what the bodies disappear ? &quot;
why do children work ?
&quot; one day , my father brought a girl with her mother , whose mother had been killed . &quot;
it was like our pet like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
&quot; I always turned the question : you were tortured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could not have been put into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill those people . but what are their bodies disappear ?
did these people not have families who were given their mort@@ al remains ?
&quot; the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ hor@@ red act , which one can do a man . &quot;
&quot; my father told me when democracy was again introduced , they fet@@ ched machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were broken and somewhere - no idea , where . &quot; one will never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something remains of course .
I have seen how you killed men ! &apos;
just to say it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just have told the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
&quot; the idea , showing my father , was created during a conversation when he was under house arrest . &quot;
&quot; I had accus@@ ations for all of the atro@@ cities , which I had to experience him . &quot;
&quot; then he said , &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ ted and asked me , what all the bu@@ oy@@ ancy of patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; which they allegedly defended , actually were good . &quot;
then I shou@@ ted :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed men !
&quot; you have committed terrible crimes , and you comp@@ elled me as a child to participate . &quot;
&quot; he only answered , &quot; Well , I &apos;ll show me . &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
&quot; in 2010 , I filed the first ad . &quot;
&quot; finally , I was finally recognized that he was a criminal . &quot;
nobody can imagine that I am vo@@ iced . I finally told my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest still standing before the end of the trial .
&quot; he was indicted for 416 crimes : including serious , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of imprisonment in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 cases , torture with subsequent death sequence in five cases and a case of ab@@ duction of one under 10 years of child . &quot;

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magn@@ itude of judgment .
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial ended in August 1975 and December 1978 committed against 7@@ 16 victims in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 Supp@@ lies were found guilty of crimes against humanity , and the judgment was sentenced in 28 cases of life sentences and in nine cases of pen@@ alties ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases , there was acqu@@ itt@@ al . &quot;
eleven of originally 54 def@@ endants were killed during the trial .
&quot; # La@@ Per@@ loader : murder , torture and rape by officers . # Es@@ war@@ State terrorism &quot;
&quot; all def@@ endants were during the dictatorship of the military , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian staff . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mont@@ i was kidn@@ apped along with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the Swiss Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by un@@ human heads .
&quot; the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations , who have been working for years on justice for the victims . &quot;
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argentin@@ ean organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , representing the children of people who were murdered during the dictatorship or disappeared : &quot;
&quot; the trial took over three years , but the research lasted for 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ inian government transferred the country to La Per@@ la , so there was a memorial to be erected there , which is now being conducted by Human Rights Organ@@ iz@@ ations . &quot;

a transmission error makes older people in Kyoto too &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation errors in a center in Kyoto can be extended in which you can extend its driver &apos;s license .
the photo was distributed in the social media .
elabor@@ ation of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese town of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can extend its driver &apos;s license , in the last month witnesses of a very special translation . &quot;
&quot; on a sign@@ post , the Japanese word ( s ) which means &quot; older drivers &quot; means &quot; older drivers &quot; mean , but perhaps also with ar@@ ches back@@ ge@@ ance &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful drive &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was from 1 to 20 September on electronic advertis@@ ements in the entrance area and in the building itself .
&quot; processing of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , divided into the social media . &quot;
&quot; the error was the translator Julian Holmes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also responsible for the local newspapers . &quot;
the liberal daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n writes in K@@ YO@@ TO :
&quot; how could it be so an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult for older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; &quot; Holmes said . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ correct English translation was initially removed . the name &quot; &quot; Fo@@ vers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; fear@@ ful drive &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate even if the gramm@@ ar is not entirely correct &quot; El@@ der Dri@@ vers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the Kyoto pre@@ fecture exc@@ used for the translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the error had already been published in the text which was checked by the translator and that the translation was not checked for their correc@@ t@@ ness before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about the exc@@ use :
&quot; we are really sorry that older people felt by in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) for our part , &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News sat down with the phenomenon of the &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; aw@@ fully &quot; was den@@ ounces as an appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers involved in accidents are involved in accidents - but quite reason to worry . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ fecture , for example , 1.@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by seniors . this represents a 10 % share . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , the Seniors 1.@@ 8@@ 03 caused by a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
thus it increased to 17.@@ 7 % .
&quot; while the number of accidents has decreased in total , the proportion of seniors in the same period has risen in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the nam@@ ing , not called reporter , published in the published version of the article comments on light , showing what pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese seem@@ ingly against older drivers : &quot;
the article on Yahoo via the translation error received the following comments :
- Is this ( &quot; fear@@ ful drive &quot; ) about the reality ?
&quot; - &quot; So trouble is the translation really not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a real translation error .
there are no such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so common in Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true mine for this bizarre mistake in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are varied .
&quot; to translate , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the text @-@ text and active language knowledge to translate it into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active rule of the target language - something that is in case of speakers . generally , the conviction that trans@@ lators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native language . &quot;
&quot; thus , a French native speakers should translate into French by the German language - not from the French to English . &quot;
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ employees with English as mother tongue that could make translations into English . this may cause lack of understanding for over@@ laying , cost reasons , or the relatively low number of English speakers who can learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies that have no foreign workers , do not leave translations . then the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is the best to be considered to be trans@@ lators - no matter how good or bad his language knowledge really are . &quot;
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the promised and r@@ ig@@ matic phr@@ ases created by machine translations , show that this technique can still replace a human trans@@ lators . this applies to some languages especially . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English phr@@ ases in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic essay , often used T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for sty@@ list@@ ings - not to be read or understood . &quot;
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be still acceptable or at least harmless . however , by major companies or from the government which have the funds to ensure higher standards , you can expect more elabor@@ ated translations . &quot;
the town of Kyoto will hopefully use a serious source of translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and c@@ ens@@ ation measures on the Internet and television
&quot; the main page of the portal &quot; &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y S@@ oc@@ ie@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezuel@@ an Internet user admitted that they had no access to the online transmitter Viv@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the Internet access from V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV were also not accessible . &quot;
&quot; other online stations contributed to the protests of protests in Caracas , which were organized by op@@ positi@@ onal groups who oppos@@ e Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro &apos;s government . &quot;
&quot; the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is stuck , and recommended the Us@@ ers , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# Z@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages Venezuel@@ an Provider are being locked again .
this is from the page of @ Viv@@ o@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offerings such as Viv@@ op@@ lay are popular with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media has been delayed since 2014 with the reporting on protests . at that time , the Commission for telecommunic@@ ations would continue to report them with monetary policy and cl@@ ut@@ ations , as the Commission would continue to report this as a &quot; call for Viol@@ ence . &quot; &quot;
without cable television and informative national television channels I have registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that it is still cheaper than to buy two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO , VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro , later , confirmed that not only Viv@@ op@@ lay was un@@ accessible by a blocking of the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two other online stations . this also concerns the website at which the National Assembly transfers its meetings . &quot;
&quot; earlier studies of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , have shown that the local internet service providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique due to the DNS servers of certain domains . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server will answer or refused the request of such a website . &quot;
&quot; we confirm DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , the transfer was set on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera was Elvis Flo@@ res , who was transferred to the protests in Caracas . &quot;
Flo@@ res was sm@@ itten while he was in custody for police custody .
&quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on con@@ sign@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; even though some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government is regulated so that the government will regulate the Internet connections : thus , the Vene@@ tians will keep access to multimedia coverage of the current events in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls will become a slave to receive training &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita boy . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today Tina struggles for the rights of children and colle@@ cts witness testimony of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , who were just as they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;
photo of Cec@@ ilia Ro@@ jas . use with friendly permission of tur@@ tur@@ ally .
&quot; the following article is the shortened version of a report of tur@@ ally , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; lying cows , exp@@ iry schools &quot; ) , edited by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household in which they did not live together with the family who lived there . &quot;
&quot; shortly before her studies at the university , she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was filled with pride on her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . when Cri@@ ad@@ itas is called cri@@ ad@@ ita in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a big family with little money gives their under@@ age son or their min@@ ty daughter to another , more abundant family . in exchange the child gets food , training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned here is that the children have to afford a countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid for victims of abuse and abuse , and all that can not raise . &quot;
&quot; as a cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , practice is widely used in Paraguay because of the involvement and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous dis@@ comfort of human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected witness , calculated and den@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call things in the name , because the feeling of grat@@ itude that is vacc@@ inated in Cri@@ ad@@ itas , is guaranteed to keep silent in general . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double del@@ e@@ tion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family , which their daughter in the faith , that they will close their training , improve their position in society and can make something of themselves &quot; can be made to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family , which occupies the girl with herself and justi@@ fies the exploitation by faith , that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise no education would be an hung@@ ered . &quot;
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mixed , his family will only experience many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience them .
&quot; in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , got a vision . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín arrived in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú in the hospital , her body showed traces of violent cl@@ aw . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former military family of Tom@@ ás Fer@@ reira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who worked as an officer at the dwell@@ s of inhabitants .
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their home in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with just 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ reira stressed the long time with a stick to Mar@@ ín until they suffered deadly injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
several days later the media reported on the incident .
they emphas@@ ized that the murdered child was a cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations like UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deeply ro@@ oted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they signed the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest in protest and demanded that &quot; no further Carolina &quot; could be in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , among which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the married couples and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded an alleg@@ ations of the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ reira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl , which was sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case comes before the case , the case by Carolina Mar@@ ín may be a landmark case - if the first time in history , Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is a case in court . &quot;
the daily life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
the Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only exploited for workers . they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , who had worked in their father , had to register bank@@ rupt@@ cy , and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; her brothers had to work all work and started to sell on the streets or on the market , to make money . &quot;
but they all went on to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ on in the capital of As@@ unci@@ on .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked in the house of her employer between four and six hours every day .
&quot; in doing so , she had to share the time that her learning was still alive . &quot;
she stood at five o &apos;clock in the morning and prepared the breakfast for their employers .
&quot; on Friday , for example , they puri@@ fy the refrigerator , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and the infected area . &quot;
&quot; when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more they had finished with learning , the more free time it had . &quot;
&quot; however , this time was limited , because she had to make dinner for their employers . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had to never be hungry , but did not get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the owner of the house@@ holders as food out of the refrigerator . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the house@@ holder , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power by Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; some of the land@@ lords of Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , in addition to him , to stand and Editorial from the opposition media such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he tried to convince them to give the reports of the official media about the regime of dict@@ ator no faith . &quot;
&quot; he kept it for intelligent , but did not hold her with her . &quot; the house@@ keeper had found someone who , while he talked about politics , &quot; says she . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t allow me to visit my family often , because they were the opinion that I would like to learn there &quot; bad habits &quot; &quot; that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who would speak to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , at home again . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared , that they might lose the education that they had allowed it again , explained them . &quot;
&quot; her , however , was completely clear that she had received her hard work for everything she had paid by them . &quot;
&quot; also in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a discri@@ minated in the school . &quot; one thing about which almost never talked about , are mo@@ b@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans that Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed to school when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other kids parents have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents , is a cri@@ ad@@ ita . &quot;
I could not invite anybody to my home . I had no circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in time where friend@@ ships are created , I felt particularly obvious that I belonged to no group . &quot;
&quot; isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
the Society cheapest the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can view jobs for cleaning personnel and children sharing in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the group of the group is Pep@@ a Ko@@ sti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city tour in As@@ unci@@ on district . &quot;
&quot; hello , I am looking for a small companion for my little daughter , who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her . &quot;
learning to learning .
please call you .
&quot; starting from Monday , if possible . &quot;

bill writes Egyptian users social media to register in the government

sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections have recently agreed to &quot; draft regulations on the usage and usage of social networks . &quot;
&quot; if he is accepted by Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt at a government agency to take advantage of social media , including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law a place would then be set up , which is contra@@ cted to use citizens to inv@@ ade social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with acceptance of the law , users had to register their users in the site of the site with their right name and personnel numbers to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; it will fail to do this , so that could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or a cash . &quot;
&quot; the bill , consisting of six par@@ agra@@ phs , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as a &quot; any application that runs over the Internet and will be used to communicate with others by voice , video , and text . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear how the law is passed when it is accepted , as the design cannot be imposed on how Egyptian authorities are supposed to register the user &apos;s users and users who are not able to register for the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to guarantee the regulation on stage of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdul Satt@@ ar , parliamentary committee and pat@@ rons of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered user names and user received a user name and a password to get through the fire@@ wall that is blocked by the Fire@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; that could mean that Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall on national level around Facebook . due to them , it would be necessary to submit information on their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known so far that such plans exist .
experts and experts are scep@@ tical about the technical mach@@ in@@ ability of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y R@@ ao@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German , Senior Research techn@@ ologist ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , Global Vo@@ ices told : &quot;
I strongly advise the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have done with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that as they could control violent physical and private rooms as they could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take it seriously , this means that it will be a powerful surveillance system to support citizens to monitor citizens or not . and that means a mad system to monitor the activities of human beings , and also to bring it a court process . &quot;
this is technically no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; in order to be approved as a law , the draft must first be discussed during the legislative elections and the Constitutional Committ@@ ees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and en@@ forcement has been successful , or not , the design is in line with a pro @-@ military monument in parliament , whose senses are maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating sc@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says R@@ ao@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the parliamentary elections of T@@ amer El @-@ Sha@@ Hawai@@ y proposed a bill of law against cy@@ ber crime , which was due to a life imprisonment for those who are guilty to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to be found in protest . &quot;

&quot; up high above in the mountains of Kurdistan in the northeast of Iraq , the H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and their team of scientists from the NGO &apos;s NGOs work to protect the Geor@@ gian Persian Leop@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of Leop@@ ards , which takes place through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ard ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are still less lo@@ ot , endangered . &quot;
why is this particular kind of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza up in the video shows , &quot; is the Persian Leopard the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the growth of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a big pre@@ dat@@ or is present . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard indeed in the wild bo@@ ar is low and goes against zero . as the team therefore emphas@@ ized that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera , breaks R@@ aza in pure joy . &quot;

&quot; in early March 2017 , documented by the Nor@@ theast Japan &apos;s daily Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress made in the last six years to re @-@ establish the life of them that triggered by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . an enormous earthquake that triggered a disaster . &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which lies in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture was a perfect pre@@ fec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s northeast , who had to experience the earthquake and the resulting tsun@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring countries of Fukushima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to destroy all coastal towns from the map .
&quot; in addition , the Fukushima pre@@ fecture experienced a nuclear accident , already on that alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses . &quot;
&quot; the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , in local view , shows the progress of six years later to rebuild the life of the local currency . &quot;
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics from the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the affected themselves .
&quot; housing estate in Fukushima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts ( on the house of the house of 14 , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ fec@@ tures of Fukushima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could be recorded , 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has finished 75 percent of such houses , while at 70 per cent of these houses . &quot;
&quot; however , six years after the catastrophe , the evacu@@ ated of accommodation , evacu@@ ated by Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ ck offers even six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated by Kaz@@ ak@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final spare parts . &quot;
&quot; after the triple catastrophe , almost 80,000 people saw themselves forced to live in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 , more than 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fukushima and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such accommodation . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of the Fukushima happened in 2011 are still living in emer@@ gen@@ cies , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of evacu@@ ated shel@@ tered after the disaster has been transferred to final houses . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the number here is 34 percent . &quot;
the state of works and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures
&quot; how the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper could determine , 10@@ 74 from 1100 schools , who were affected by the disaster , had opened its doors to December 2016 , which is almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures is far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while nearly 100 percent of fish@@ eries in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation again , 30 percent of fish@@ eries are re@@ produced in Fukushima . &quot;
&quot; tsun@@ ami and nuclear accident , have moved in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures agricultural land . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed ar@@ able land in Fukushima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear , as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed ar@@ able land of Fukushima , lying in the &quot; nuclear pl@@ ywood zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , the tourism has expanded again , but the Fukushima remained un@@ defeated . &quot;
&quot; tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 per cent on the same stand as before the disaster . Fukushima , on the other hand , it can only be 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it has been more difficult to earn their living . &quot;
is the local population prepared on the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to identify a complete picture , the newspaper carried out many documents under the native population and under the evacu@@ ation by . she asked them about the state of reconstruction and also , as her emp@@ athy has changed compared to the tsun@@ ami risk . &quot;
in her introduction of the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o Zeitung explains :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey through to bring more about the tsun@@ ami awareness among local population in experience .
&quot; the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local population , measures taken hold on future earthqu@@ akes and tsun@@ am@@ is prepared . &quot;
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those surveyed say that still not enough for cat@@ astrop@@ hes had been done . &quot;
&quot; as it stands for those who had evacu@@ ated from the Fukushima pre@@ fecture , &quot;
&quot; in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has strengthened its attention also to the position of evacu@@ ated from Fukushima . &quot;
&quot; Fukushima not only had to experience the tremendous earthqu@@ akes and the devastating tsun@@ ami , no , the Fukushima pre@@ fecture was also a witness to the worst , disast@@ rous , atomic disorder which had to be experienced in Japan . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 evacu@@ ated from Fukushima , nearly 63 000 people were moved in areas outside the pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 there were some more than 23 000 people , returned to Fukushima , in permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; most of the evacu@@ ated areas are most of the evacu@@ ated houses , which still have to be able to re@@ apply since the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fukushima , which are part of the Olympic Games that will be part of the Olympic Games that will be held in Tokyo by 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our po@@ d@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people meet people from other countries , which speak a different language , the differences seem to be higher than the common@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; however , after a while , it is often noticeable that a more combines one than it appears at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important because they demand our pre@@ judi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world finally is very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we will look closely these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we will deal with topics that often get fewer attention when reporting . &quot;
&quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly associated with someone over voice and country borders . &quot;
&quot; Veron@@ iki Cri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the common@@ alities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man expl@@ aining how the love of music worked on Iranian culture ; Viol@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa talks about the time where she worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b has collected on his experience , which he has collected in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira da Silva , studied social sciences at the German university of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skul@@ ls of brain trau@@ ma and several fra@@ c@@ tures . &quot;
doctors performed it on this Saturday and got him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
&quot; the local picture journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos from the attack on Mat@@ eus , which quickly spread rapidly within a few days . &quot;
&quot; on the pictures , the face of the police officers can recognize , which attack a striking stock . the man was identified as Augusto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had suspended until the conclusion of the incident of the active service . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers as he performs in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his impact stock on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; a police officer was beaten up by a demonstr@@ ators , and landing on the intensive care station , would be able to see his face six months in television and the whole supp@@ ression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of Media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , distributed by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , was attacked by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officers and several san@@ itation shortly thereafter . &quot;

police gri@@ ps
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to brutal police officers on protest@@ ers last Friday .
&quot; polic@@ emen were set up by protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers , rubber @-@ fin and tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
&quot; member of Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police via loud@@ speakers to aband@@ on violence against protest@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media street prot@@ agon@@ ists re@@ jects the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window disc . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported targeted on a broken glass window to illustr@@ ate their cover pages with a photo .
&quot; in contrast , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a set of fire . &quot;
&quot; there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window disc than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing . &quot;
&quot; this is necessary to recognize , if you stri@@ ve to damage any form of damage . &quot;
&quot; here also the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; is a absurd , un@@ question@@ able meaning , and the typical violence of the military police are led by headlines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on con@@ front@@ ational course with the police . &quot; &quot;
those of the kidn@@ apped villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the Act of Á@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the Pop@@ ular Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the Western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as an el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - known to say that there is no considerable sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were made in the sugar tube factories .
&quot; after exploring the sugar industry in the region still quietly , and the factory lost after and after its plants , until only the rum@@ ors of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 272 workers had to be re@@ inv@@ ent .
some changes the work .
&quot; other re@@ signed and comm@@ ute every day at the factories , still grinding . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who stands up every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar tube industry does not have his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are in the east of the region of sugar production , which are once again in operation after a long in@@ active time , because they were obtained . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene remembers that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would have received the sugar cane factory but the promise was not kept .
&quot; the sugar tube industry already resistance the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , the poor administration , and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , the production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for the country some decades ago , but the poor did not have any curiosity . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar industry switched off ?
the old platform of the village saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar tube industry was an economic necessity : 155 sugar production plants were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive for the country . &quot;
initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories that amounted to 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories left to produce sugar for 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the moti@@ fs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar plant@@ ations and the sovereign debt on the global market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price increased about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; by 2017 , the price of in@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; Agricultural spek@@ tiven &quot; published by the OECD and FAO , the Agricultural and Nutrition organisation of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; when current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar exports would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day is to enter into history , &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
from then on the process of re@@ structure started in the sugar industry .
&quot; in the following years , the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked since 1967 in the factory .
&quot; if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , is known about the closure of the factory , the word that he is repeated most repeatedly , &quot; fraud . &quot; &quot;
almost all respondents in the same opinion : not one of them has been informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order to get the place , it formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first performance year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially written documents , which would be removed only regarding the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could be evacu@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility took over and the letters became increasingly more frequent . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the set @-@ in factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money , &quot; he insured . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , waiting for the retirement in another plant , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved against his will at the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with any part , which he removed , he dismant@@ led one of his 31 years . &quot;
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and most important work@@ stations was removed .
&quot; in many cases no alternatives for the work places and services , which were generated in the municipalities in which they were in , were created . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the mamm@@ oth speech of 21 October 2002 , the then president in the eyes of the present persons saw that he was guaranteed for the oppos@@ ing that factories run out of their factories for five years . &quot;
the price of the population for closure of sugar production
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted highly by M@@ ath . &quot;
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years , the church community Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things are changing , but not always to better if a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar be@@ hr@@ factory decided , or better , when they began to make them off , they also listened to asp@@ hal@@ ing the road that also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to search other factories . &quot;
they were to spare parts .
&quot; without the future perspective , many young people left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production is not for the supply of the church . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty wounded the old soldiers a pension of two thousand Pes@@ o a month to spend the years retired in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
&quot; Yahweh N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear@@ er voice , is no subsequent person , but he gives the lies that they told him not . &quot;
they tor@@ ment it for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene goes with 65 years in pension , not because it is lacking in power , but because it is bitter . &quot;

first Nations young people use Hip @-@ Hop to express yourself and maintain their own culture
recording of a song of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
&quot; young people from the First Nations communities in the whole of Canada works with topics , which are important for them . they do with hip hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an tour since 2014 , workshop director mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres to accommodate youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the ped@@ agog@@ ues David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North @-@ Quebec with ten Cre@@ e @-@ communities and then working together with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop Group The North@@ star . &quot;
&quot; the workshop is thus increasing that the young particip@@ ations in talks , such as &quot; cultural identity , language , con@@ frontation , love , self @-@ acceptable &quot; or whatever they are in mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young@@ sters are the main actors .
&quot; because workshops were so popular , the team worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the trunk of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o , in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , even &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; in which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were mostly resolved .

in Japan one can see in front of almost any restaurant plastic dishes .
&quot; to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , will be displayed close to the entrance of the entrance to the entrance of the entrance to the entrance of the entrance to the entrance of the entrance to the entrance to the entrance to the entrance . &quot;
customers are viewing this plastic dishes and then decide if they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the to@@ ot@@ oter district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there are a variety of these small companies which produce those plastic dishes , which has documented the German filmmaker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; most Japanese are these plastic dishes such as usual , they don &apos;t even stand for them . however , a new trend is transformed into current mobile phone accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; in Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome , the Blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sho@@ ot@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
&quot; now in a special sale : new decorated with plastic ornam@@ ents , as they are displayed in K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u Kauf@@ haus . &quot;
&quot; many of these arti@@ f@@ ici@@ zing foods have been transformed to kit@@ sch@@ y collective objects , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets : &quot;
here are some Sho@@ ot@@ hin refriger@@ ator@@ ic mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of the essence will increasingly be more elabor@@ ate .
in this case a cave @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) has been transformed into a mobile rack .
for these tri@@ ang@@ ular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile phone .
we also made this part in the Tokyo Station exhibition .
&quot; here is an apple , which is holding your mobile phone : &quot;
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a score for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing flight into coma .
&quot; some mobile support and mobile designers allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura and Lach@@ s@@ che@@ ated is used , a popular t@@ opping , served with white rice . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , some users had their doubts : &quot;
&quot; there is someone who said : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can che@@ ated my mobile phone with laugh@@ ing ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appe@@ ti@@ zing form to surprise colleagues or family members un@@ pleasant .
our newest mobile support has the shape of mel@@ mel@@ ts ice .
&quot; moreover , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand straps of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; for more quir@@ ky plastic dishes , you can see at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter using the h@@ ash@@ tag # 22 . &quot;
&quot; if you like to learn more about the origin of this trends , then this video gives you insight into the district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi who dedic@@ ates itself at the popularity of the restaurant industry . as for example , with the sho@@ ot@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells stories of the survivors of fighting against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of fighting against drug dealers , &quot;

&quot; in reports , domestic and foreign media on the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug traff@@ icking &quot; in Mexico , the mi@@ sts and mo@@ ckers are regularly reflected in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that fight against this struggle . &quot;
&quot; the reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ ells , pressed the stories of conflict in the conflict perfectly in the background . &quot;
&quot; a day after a violent incident , anyone looks at the sad@@ ness or the communities that have learned to live with pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every body , behind each bone fund in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never heal . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has announced the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; to live a voice ) and tells stories of man who told the struggle between the prosecution authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project such as :
organized crime we will not just fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
&quot; for example , if stores close , because they are threatened by drug dealers and therefore need to drive many more kilometres to buy something like milk . &quot;
the pain of victims
a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el m@@ ie@@ do &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear@@ ful life &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who is seeking secret graves after his son . &quot;
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who died on only one day their father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ phe@@ w . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves to the task , which we have set ourselves , go and to graves , according to the men who we loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in a electric shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
&quot; on October 13 , he left the house . &quot;
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need an apprenticeship . &quot;
&quot; my mother , too , is my mother , too . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , it has no income . &quot;
&quot; you are the insurance of my father , but it does not get paid out because they demand a death assessment . &quot;
where should we get this ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; editors &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we do not only have to show the faces of those who are afraid of fear . we need to show the international community for conflicts , frag@@ ility and stat@@ ute . &quot;
the project is based on stories by readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of animal pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
&quot; as a result , illness and sens@@ ory journ@@ alism have I already known for several years now . &quot;
&quot; each day I pass newspaper c@@ ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the cover pages with pictures , which are actually only from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or files from experts . &quot;
it brings me from the version .
&quot; sometimes I feel the feeling , as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body . &quot;
I cannot be the same or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old C@@ ousin thinks that he is great . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic parents &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is that , as if they deri@@ ves those who have lost someone , and those who have fear that they had something like that . &quot;
I see our weakness if stories are too blo@@ wn numbers in a statistic .
&quot; the crime of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbor should be justified , that they were &quot; dead . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they try to agree that they are sp@@ ared from such trage@@ dies , if they do not stir and still remain silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; &quot; Four months of ext@@ ortion in the main city district : how a family was pl@@ under@@ ed with threats for the month &apos;s money from their business , until they did not only destroy the store , but also their family apart . &quot;
&quot; you think of everything you lost , and remember how many people can change your whole life in just a few days . &quot;
&quot; the pain is never passes away , trau@@ ma stays , the anxiety is coming up again , if you are alone . &quot;
habits have changed and phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the further we are far from each other , the better . &quot;
she shut her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because they don &apos;t know when they will de@@ duce you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I was asked to dissolve my deep feelings in these terrible days , but the answer is no , because I have forgotten how to weep . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the &quot; &quot; For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : one of the generation of violence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions such as : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mex@@ ic@@ os ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them . &quot;
&quot; Bryan is a Wa@@ ise and he tells that he had to teach himself like a egg cooked , potatoes crum@@ bs , tortillas warm , and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies that live with him . this is his name for the preparation of fl@@ acon with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy who had to learn the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live thereby .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was over two years earlier , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , the bloody dead bodies had been shot dead by armed men . &quot;
&quot; when Bryan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
&quot; Bryan was born in 2006 , when violence was organised by the organised crime and the fight against the existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders of public security and government of the United States government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the public prosecutor &apos;s office 3@@ 103 murders . this corresponds to 8.5 murders per day . &quot;
&quot; these are just some hundreds of thousands of stories , which leaves the organised crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate the country &apos;s soul . &quot;
&quot; only few stories live in view of new headlines . but this project , however , reminds us of those who we cannot forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 , whose goal is to tor@@ mented the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traff@@ icking , which has passed the country in the last four decades . &quot;
&quot; if a picture is worth a thousand words , &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ ing is Car@@ ing &quot; from the Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages , to which he ver@@ ts , contain pictures , on which violence is represented . &quot;
the fact check is important in a moment in which it &apos;s about to raise a rum@@ or to un@@ mask a fake .
&quot; but what &apos;s the years after something changed the first time ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , tend to exist . &quot;
let &apos;s take this photograph of a terrible accident over seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
&quot; since its first release , it has been used mis@@ leading , trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false copy of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false description &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices , or First Dra@@ ft News - deny that there is plenty of careful reporting about events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire to pictures .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a gas wag@@ ons crossed the place San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te and explo@@ ded . 230 people were killed . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war in Africa , the second largest country had been negle@@ cted and thus devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become too dangerous ar@@ ca@@ des , which were difficult to drive . &quot;
trag@@ ically trag@@ ically fell victim to the tank .
&quot; a fire@@ ball was described as a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses including a cinemas near , which was full of human being the soccer World Cup . &quot;
houses of brutal and knot@@ ted cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to infin@@ ity .
&quot; a painting with the title &quot; &quot; That is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; by Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ user Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al pictures of the incident form the atro@@ cious scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example .
it shows rows of hol@@ low body that stum@@ bled on the ground while they have a look at people .
but here the story does not find her end .
&quot; over the years the same photo was exp@@ elled on the same photo several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but do not get involved in the context of trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the excav@@ ation of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
ophthalm@@ ologists reported dra@@ stically of atro@@ cities in which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were burned in streets and bus@@ hes .
&quot; reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the figures could not be confirmed , but no one remained back to count bodies , &quot; said one inhabitants on Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many have been crushed , shot or burned . &quot;
only on the basis of satellite images could be illustrated by the follow @-@ up time .
&quot; the occasion for the attack remained un@@ explained , but the army site in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt to win B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here , the picture from the DR Congo appeared as proof of the fact , as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented : &quot;
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this mis@@ used use of the DR Congo is only one in a number of false descriptions . Africa Check has been docum@@ enting Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as a cover for mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; another step further , personal comments like this example , denied the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments . &quot;
the picture from San@@ ge came to Myanmar in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash message , published by the United Nations , those who have been able to escape , rape and some dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported from violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts how the following that these descriptions were assembled with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian News page , which claimed that the President My@@ an@@ m@@ ars Th@@ an being said , monks and politicians had participated in the assassination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from the DR Congo to keep this information . &quot;
&quot; the original entry , which was accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be called here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations , who called AFP as their source , had also attributed to Th@@ an being this statement , but did not agree to the picture from the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide operating range : in@@ correct information
traces of these false mates are back up to 2011 and 2012 and actually come back all over the world .
&quot; using a &quot; reverse picture search , &quot; you can see how far more information can be crossed . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 344 pictures of 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) with 344 pictures , which are very similar to the discussed picture of the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixed mas@@ ch private sites , platforms social media and public publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have for@@ warded false reports , agreed , and others tried to un@@ mask the forg@@ eries . &quot;
&quot; we have some examples of the mis@@ used use and brought them to the respective countries in connection , based on which side they had been published . by this , we want to represent the range more clearly than by language . &quot;
several examples of mis@@ used use can be used from the listed countries ( which were also associated with each other ) .
here are some cases which can now be completely divided ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
country examples of false copy of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
&quot; the orange countries show up to pages or servers , about the examples of counterfeit or fal@@ lo@@ oms are still available . &quot;
&quot; the countries in grey are examples that are available according to met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available via Tin@@ y@@ Eye , probably also counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing examples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;

&quot; this post , which led to the members of the Russian Orthodox church , clearly shows that the picture of the DR Congo is NOT showing Muslims to kill Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ an being in 2012 , that monks and politicians had been involved in the killing of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the picture from San@@ ge . &quot;
&quot; the article has been updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication , the picture remains included . &quot;
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article by 2014 on students who were killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic news of An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , expressly explained that the picture was not written by the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar d@@ schi@@ p attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in connection with the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te its connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria bur@@ ns , the world sleeps ) . &quot;
&quot; the picture of the DR Congo appeared , with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and led a discussion under Muslims following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the port to Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to reach this that their communities found these events , which took place in the name of the Islam@@ s , a larger attention . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was recre@@ ated as proof of the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times back ) . however , the messages that were associated with it were taken in no religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the goal was to raise attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media coverage in the way of Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message that was report@@ edly written by a &quot; &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; on the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacres , it was translated into circulation such as this in Vietnamese and declared it to the fal@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; from the message that included the picture from the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ine mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; another confirmed examples of a defective use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; in other accounts , ag@@ gregation and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) shows Tin@@ Eye also , but are no longer fully tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan , and possibly China . &quot;
( data entry with UR@@ Ls and time@@ - / date stamp references on the we@@ cra@@ wler and isolated they have imag@@ inations related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately become a correct description , but the original entry is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( frames ) that attract these posts . the first frame is focused on religion .
the photo was used in terms of greater discussions about the silence of Muslims by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the victims of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is valued at a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth to investigate how pictures are used in connection with these efforts .
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer give this images longer . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are funny people who have an un@@ intenti@@ onal share in order to tr@@ ench the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; this mood of the mis@@ - and false information suggests that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and tasted the actual tom@@ bs of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of non@@ violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
&quot; an argument is that it comes back from pictures of a ref@@ us@@ al , to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even requested by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , concern that non@@ violent images of readers and viewers will des@@ ize the ability to emp@@ athy emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which sought to help violent media on the other ) . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo of Andy Simmons uses in accordance with CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. un@@ mistak@@ able ) is stri@@ ving to offer language fans a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate .
&quot; such words are available in any language : they press certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot;
some of these un@@ mistak@@ able words are already well @-@ known ( as the famous Portuguese aci@@ da@@ de ) and others who ro@@ oted in a specific culture ( for example the Spanish fl@@ es@@ esa ) .
but everyone resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly in every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not sufficient , why a full explanation and sometimes a little context required to understand exactly what is meant with this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; in the blog you can find words from V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , as follows : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ ü@@ h for your parents in recognition of it , as trying to have you in your younger years . &quot;
&quot; and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or sl@@ oth@@ fulness , that feels , after being caught in cold days in the sun . &quot;
&quot; in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words , from his blog over : &quot;
&quot; they s@@ anders other cultures , reveal other ideas and raise our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , like we want to analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page even more of this &quot; un@@ mistak@@ able &quot; words , and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of &quot; Treas@@ ure Languages &quot; , &quot; which are greatly appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot;

&quot; like Sri Lanka , with the worst flood catastrophe of the decade &quot;
&quot; at the moment of the island of Sri Lanka , the worst flood and penet@@ rating disaster occurred in this decade . &quot;
&quot; the mon@@ soon , which usually takes place in late May are caused by severe rainfall , rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country on the shore . &quot;
&quot; after a statement by the emergency centre of Sri Lanka , on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and slaughter . &quot;
&quot; more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe residence halls . &quot;
&quot; the rain falls on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water distances slowly declined . &quot;
health and hygiene levels of population constitute a massive challenge in the affected areas and still un@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos conv@@ ey an impression of the magn@@ itude of the flood catastrophe :
flood water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water distances of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka Twe@@ et provide regular updates to high water situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s fatal flight wor@@ sen wor@@ sen the crisis crisis , Save the Children , after other rain falls already on the way . &quot;
&quot; today , Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood at the floods of water , water level up to 6 metres . Mor@@ ago@@ da village was flooded with G@@ alle by the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the air force has provided five planes for rescue operations , and five are made available for transport of emergency deliveries to the residents included in their flooded villages . &quot;
various organizations and start@@ ups have also been explained to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od V@@ ICT@@ I@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information about high water situation and humanitarian aid .
if any search and lif@@ egu@@ ards dr@@ ones need dr@@ ones for their operations please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
&quot; for all , to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims - &quot;

please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 when animals need help in this field .
&quot; the Tax@@ ir@@ ter app Pic@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their site data with the help of the app , so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ Center will be informed . &quot;
&quot; last year after the disaster of the Trophy Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ me introduced a &quot; High Water@@ fall &quot; key , which allowed users to pick up a vehicle for pickup from help and donations . these were then for@@ warded to the sr@@ il@@ ank@@ ian Red Cross . &quot;
&quot; they also led a &quot; SOS &quot; button , which included more than thousands of questions and 150 successful bo@@ ret@@ ou@@ ting actions by flood water and land@@ slides . &quot;
&quot; the efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exhausted , residents in need of safety and contribute to help the help of help . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further human lives , with the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot;

the Women &apos;s March on 21 . January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ ib G@@ ha@@ zi .
&quot; when in January , I took the Women &apos;s March at the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and loving girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; I trust her my four year old daughter , she confi@@ ded to me her children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
in one minute we are still calling slo@@ gan@@ s for women &apos;s rights .
in the next row we add rights to trans@@ gender .
&quot; we are in a sea of rain@@ coats and people , some keep the iconic images of a woman with head cloth high , bound from an American flag , other par@@ ol@@ ises against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looked at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things do not affect you , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot;
I have already led these conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who have been working for years now separate me - the Sah@@ ar , who they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their imagination . &quot;
they susp@@ ect me .
there are around 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t see all the same .
we practice our religion different .
&quot; we identify themselves to be a Muslim , in different art . but somehow we are all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is well constructed in our collective imagination , that as soon as Muslims , which as I do not fit there , is mus@@ li@@ fied . &quot;
re@@ mus@@ li@@ zes become
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this is even the poet that poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what pictures are in the sense when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as a Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western performance , religion was deleted by Rum@@ is as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this lion makes a big part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another exists in the reduced images of Muslims who have been colon@@ ized Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting image language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
&quot; in the 1970s , the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward Said dismant@@ led the history behind these pictures . &quot;
&quot; however , these pictures continue to rise again today . &quot;
&quot; in addition to our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood . &quot;
&quot; I have been working in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen how this powerful , fla@@ wed nar@@ r@@ ative is dominant our news@@ feeds . &quot;
&quot; this nar@@ rati@@ vely overs@@ ha@@ dow the reality , that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the United States could not be able to vote their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this nar@@ r@@ v fails to recognize that when French , Muslim women will be hin@@ dered to carry her head cloth in public buildings and to cover acid Arab , Muslim women through their government to cover the entire body both sides of the same medal . &quot;
a powerful group pract@@ ises his &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; other &quot; .
this powerful nar@@ rati@@ v weak@@ ens Muslim women who conduct movements for change .
&quot; it &apos;s the way that the first Muslim prayers had been spoken to the American soil of Afri@@ cans , which were brought to slaves with slaves . &quot;
it del@@ etes the existence of que@@ er Muslims .
&quot; this nar@@ rati@@ v has occupied our collective pre@@ dic@@ tive force of such a deep and in@@ correct , that often S@@ ik@@ h @-@ men and children are aiming at target in@@ tim@@ acy attacks and ch@@ ic@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories we tell and due to the way in which we tell you , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts .
or to alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ r@@ ative that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the nar@@ rati@@ vely of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims make up the highest degree &quot; various &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than a third of the whole Muslim population are African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims are among the immigrants from the first generation that come from 77 countries .

&quot; at that time , when Khan was re@@ thinking the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were uns@@ ur@@ red Muslims and Americans . &quot;

&quot; sometimes , if people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork meat , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes , I say , instead of my Muslim recipes , all Muslims with themselves - &quot; from respect to Pep@@ p@@ ah W@@ utz . &quot;

we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists , and inter@@ religious activists who stri@@ ve to fight much widespread lies over Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced in the ongoing volume of a well @-@ ador@@ ned Islamic refin@@ ery machine with funding , think tanks and experts for the fal@@ se@@ hood , which is our already fla@@ wed picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is manipul@@ ated . &quot;

I want to explain that .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but a Muslim was first born when I was four years old when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they attack the following terms : faith , behaviour and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavi@@ ours are perhaps not always visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neighbor , my rock in the fire that I am the Muslim , when they could look through the 15 @-@ metre @-@ concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the evening rit@@ ual with my daughter , when I kept them in my arms , and you have the Arab verses to protect the Koran and the Q@@ s . &quot;
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I pray therefore that they are protected from evil , evil that can be seen and to the evil that one can &apos;t see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow . &quot;

&quot; to be the Muslim , how she taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that has been colon@@ ised over centuries by a &quot; empire &quot; which was founded by a company with the name of honour@@ able British Ost@@ ini@@ des @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a profound importance to name God , my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians , their families , as with my grandfather , colon@@ ists from colon@@ ists who have dealt with the Muslim world as at stake . &quot;

an American Muslim means to know that the suicide rate has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means to know that if a tragedy off the USA and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name bears the story four times more than a story with a white attack .
&quot; it means to know that four hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liberated black slaves with the name Bil@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that two hundred years ago , an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought into this country . &quot;

&quot; it exists in the immigration officer , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child . &quot;

&quot; we are too deep to reveal the Muslim , or the &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we stand for decades , recogni@@ zing the roots of our fears , and the fla@@ wed and dangerous image prints , which we have in our news editors . &quot;

initiative for nar@@ r@@ ative art wants to keep urban language diversity
&quot; tell the story , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
&quot; can there be an option , here and now despite a language barrier with someone in touch with someone ? &quot;
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the stories of stories in their original language is a possible response . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about a different initiative by Steven Bird , the Un@@ translated blog . &quot;
&quot; however , here is the focus of T@@ LS not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain the language diversity of great cities and to treat . &quot;
&quot; in fact , urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS already has been carried out since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages will not be given to the children born there . &quot;
for the makers of this project :
&quot; the mass mortality of the world can be avoided if we accept cities , accept diversity - safe rooms , in which inhabitants don &apos;t have to be forgotten , who they are to belong to . &quot;
&quot; while listening is often associated with it , to understand &quot; purposes these events instead &quot; hear , to appreciate , to make use . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers put their story initially in their own language and translate , or explain it in English . &quot;
&quot; if the participants don &apos;t have professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their de@@ vot@@ ion and their representation is that the listeners were leaving . &quot;
&quot; they call laughter and emotions , when the language is no longer a barrier . &quot;
&quot; the following video shows a traditional history from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller ra@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou cont@@ ests take the opportunity to explain the nar@@ r@@ ative art of nar@@ r@@ ative art . &quot;
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the f@@ uss of the rab@@ bit and the po@@ vi@@ an in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; after having explained the importance of his dest@@ al , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it that does not understand an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in , he divi@@ des his feeling of exclu@@ si@@ vity : &quot;
you have heard !
they were attentive ...
they were completely with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities , and the organis@@ ers hope to expand this . all that are inspired by the project can contact with T@@ LS in contact to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ elling performances . &quot;
Puerto Rico urges the US re@@ constitution of state debt
&quot; the aim of a new testing of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amount to 72 million US dollars , took place on April 3 , 2017 , several religious and bourgeois organizations involved in mass demonstration ; the march started at the pu@@ er@@ ori@@ de Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
she was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audit@@ or@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civil Front for the neur@@ on of the debt ) and the National Assembly of Puerto Ric@@ os .
&quot; a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States . &quot;
this is her call :
&quot; the people Puerto Ric@@ os demands that politicians , banks and government authorities , who are responsible for the debt , is responsible for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial inspection and an tap committee without personal interests to the public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions , which is in favour of the economy . &quot;
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people Puerto Rico ref@@ uses to pay a debt which is not their .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be deduc@@ ted with sin@@ king pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not in the state @-@ member of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; an independent non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , a law for state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state agency . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis in Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of government infrastructure .
&quot; in the outside , measures imposed without participation and conviction of citizens are danger to be rejected by the people . &quot;
the demonstration bore the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

it is a tribute to Bas@@ sel and his work .
&quot; in the introduction , it is : &quot;
&quot; this book wants to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built , and what the true cost is to which this is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have been working on page to view over the ne@@ bula and to create something from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated internet volunteers , held in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was kn@@ itted from the A@@ dra prison directory , which he sat on October 3 , 2015 . &quot;
we have since been no information about his current state or residence .
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release , and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom . &quot;
&quot; see how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , has to let many of us begin to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
&quot; in this process , what did we use extreme belie@@ fs in this process ? &quot;
&quot; since March 2012 , the web developer of Open Source and digital activist has been detained by Syrian government agencies since March 2012 . &quot;
&quot; in October 2015 Bas@@ sel was made out of the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown location . &quot;
&quot; his wife , writer and lawyer N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi reported that the &quot; Military Police Bas@@ sel had taken part on a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military tribunal from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported that it was contacted by persons on November 12 , 2015 , who presented themselves as the insi@@ der @-@ Assad government , and they were aware of an alleged death toll against her husband . &quot;
his residence and state remains unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a decisive role in which access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and presently overview of the ladder by New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
maybe there was no one of Bass@@ els cultural prototypes pro@@ spective than the work that he started around in 2005 with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually con@@ structive the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the distance of numerous ci@@ vil@@ is@@ ations and are mer@@ ging the Greek @-@ Roman architectural types with hi@@ es@@ ome traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; Bas@@ sel was not able to know that ten years after he started working with this work , the IS would put everything on it , these architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Syrians but the world . &quot;
&quot; this strip into digital archae@@ ology and preser@@ vation has created a period of time , which will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , Bas@@ sel could not yet conclude this project until now . &quot;
&quot; N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi contributed to the book , and writes about the passion of her husband , to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I spent my entire life with it , dre@@ aming of freedom to dream and Bas@@ sel taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel gave me English at even when he was already in jail .
&quot; I learned to read , write and speak English . &quot;
&quot; he always has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has been asked , and he has taught other imprisoned , to write and speak English . &quot;
Bas@@ sel has opened the gate to the technology . he taught me both computers and smart phones .
he brought me the Internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners like computers , at least theore@@ tically , without that they actually had one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ filing , which she wrote in custody for the years 2012 to 2015 . &quot;
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura have worked together on the book for one year .
she sailed the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from the Arab into English .
the book is free available .

here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening &quot; :
&quot; it happens in every visit , &quot;
&quot; I sing in the world of your ench@@ anting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the mind in the moment , in which we embrace ourselves , &quot;
&quot; every person who doesn &apos;t matter to me , &quot;

I forget the pris@@ ings of the prison
and I roll into every detail of your voice and words .
&quot; I bear with passion for my passion , &quot;
if your eyes say farewell
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
&quot; to recover all the moments , &quot;
&quot; and on your absence , to weep and smile . &quot;
I testify to myself that I will return soon ...
&quot; on the first anniversary of the arrest of Bas@@ sel , G@@ ha@@ zi wrote : &quot;

&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of the monster
bass &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests against Bashar al Ass@@ ads , since the beginning of the protests against Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) , more than 6@@ 5.000 people have disappeared . &quot;
&quot; those who were arrested or executed under non@@ violence by the regime , tortured or even executed . &quot;
&quot; since 2011 , according to the international human rights organisation , Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in prison since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community demands the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
today we repeat our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mozambique : due to corruption and prosec@@ uted director after dis@@ miss@@ al release on the previous post
&quot; Mos@@ ambi@@ ans re@@ acted with anger on a corruption case , in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus , where corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; at Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 together with four other def@@ endants with four other def@@ endants ( about 800 000 euros ) was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds from Mozambique , whose Council Cam@@ b@@ aza was appointed between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of a good lead and immediately requested his re @-@ setup into the company , which took place on April 19 then . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with an opinion of the General Pro@@ secution of the Republic , which granted the application for Cam@@ b@@ aza , there would be no barrier to refer back to his old post , since the company was not able to deal with the company . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not call this action well . &quot;
&quot; the centre for public integrity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution which asser@@ ted for public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to address the director . &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption , and clearly indicates the lack of transparency and even a reg@@ ression with regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we have to know is that the company should have to lead a discipl@@ ined procedure against the contradi@@ ctions .
&quot; the company , however , apparently and caused no reasonable legal steps to use the appropriate functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a major voice in the Mozambique social media , re@@ jects this behaviour also and considers the case as &quot; resi@@ dency &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent guy , he would have adviser to having been sentenced to one prison sentence and half of them have eaten . &quot;
&quot; he could keep paid lectures and motiv@@ ating words , he could consult and im@@ pose his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company that he helped viol@@ ate damage . &quot;
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will gladly pay for his silence .
resi@@ sting !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says , the director possessed no mor@@ ality : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the state , because he can &apos;t believe it , that one has rewarded someone in such a way that the state has already cleared so massi@@ vely . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the mor@@ ality to return to the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has only served himself on the state instead . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was used by the state , as a hand@@ ler to become an in@@ exhau@@ stible source of money and the state itself is weary of this man , and finally sentenced to a long term imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remember the prime minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remember that a thief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; Die@@ be belong to the prison , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el will not only remain in memory for ever as the first independent president in memory , but also as a sharp , conc@@ ision and - by way - prophe@@ tic Red@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous represent@@ ations was , as he affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious human being able to be able to sell the fath@@ er@@ land for its amb@@ itions , its own individu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambitious human being changes , my experience shows that this is not the case . he changes the tac@@ tic , but he doesn &apos;t change from his amb@@ itions . &quot;
an ambitious man is criminal at the same time .
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also le@@ aning : &quot;
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison for 10 years and was freed .

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored to many users
the bur@@ ial word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means K@@ ich@@ er@@ erb@@ se or Sp@@ age .
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Commons , Creative Commons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ p@@ orted &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the known Social Network received its posts from the net because they played the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; even though the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to as@@ sign to people of East Indian origin or as an ad@@ jec@@ tively &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook is cen@@ sored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or of the &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; ( in bur@@ ial let@@ tering ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radic@@ ally nation@@ alistic movements has given the word an extremely ab@@ dic@@ ated con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that mostly be used by Ultra nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be brought together with rac@@ ism in connection , but the word itself is calling out to hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that , in which they have discussed the use of the word , or doubt the use of his use , were cen@@ sored . &quot;
&quot; moreover , there are several bur@@ ial words with basic different mean@@ ings that have the same letter steps as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , the chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; which contains the same letters , as well as other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ ebook@@ user A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends on the spiritu@@ ally kind , whether they might know how he could relie@@ ve his back pain by doing a word . &quot;
&quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that they will reduce hate speech of a radical nation@@ alists , but also emphas@@ ized that Facebook needs to be analytical , before it all the posts that are suspected to spread rac@@ ism in the sus@@ pic@@ ion . &quot;
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it will filter the word automatically .
automation will not understand what you write to Fac@@ en@@ ook .
&quot; what is supposed to do instead , is to analyze the post carefully and check it by using the following words . &quot;
&quot; for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pairs &quot; ( sp@@ elling verses ) . &quot;
&quot; the best is that these three nation@@ alists , that hate speech , received a pretty good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action will send a strong signal to all , hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy can &apos;t stop long . &quot;
&quot; the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have demonstrated that the c@@ ens@@ orship of perc@@ ussions often be a cat@@ astrop@@ hic and mouse game , whereby the users will simply start to use social networks to express a new word or an alternative writing of the cen@@ sored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to er@@ ase his posts when he just wanted to tell his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ban@@ ished by the social network : &quot;
... &quot; when I was att@@ enti@@ vely attentive to this new directive of Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is closed . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my mail from Facebook was removed and I was forbidden to accept items and parts of content for 24 hours because the post &quot; &quot; Facebook community standards did not answer . &quot; &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative int@@ entions or simply try to show their opinions on hate speech radic@@ ally nation@@ alists .
&quot; Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech : &quot;
post without hate speech on Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author divided his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious Fundam@@ ent@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community for advice : &quot;
Facebook might have a welfare int@@ ent to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by their platform but it does not work .
&quot; such words , however , will bring out more hatred within the different communities . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it appears as if they have begun without local context or technical support , and as words like &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Erb@@ cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; have been prohibited . &quot;
&quot; even when they found out , they did not have mistakes , they tried not to correct the adulter@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; if they only have more respect for the 15 million benefits , which had a big turnover , it would be great . &quot;
Fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ orship is su@@ ck@@ led among users for a lot .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now have fun and write about the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech to see whether their posts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which had no hate speech , but still removed : &quot;

&quot; over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alistic ide@@ ologies and religious Fundam@@ ent@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks should also heating in the municipalities in Myanmar , especially in the field of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disp@@ utes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to escape . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been to say for its failure , to put out Hass@@ elt Hass@@ ler on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sites under control . &quot;
&quot; but instead of using just the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better running on context than on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is the end of the children &apos;s before
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo of Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 . &quot;
the child &apos;s before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s parliament unanimously approved a law that is supposed to offer this practice , so that the married old age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; prior to this change of adul@@ terer and Muslim communities held in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ Persian ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the religious groups of the country , said that the state was not to inter@@ fere with the country , since that , at age not the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened to the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago has defined a contra@@ ctual partner of the UN Children &apos;s Convention , the min@@ ors , under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; the UN &apos;s statistics for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were already married with 15 were already married in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago at 2.8 percent , and with 18 percent there were 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Federal Environment Agency confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 boys in 1997 @-@ 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online pet@@ itions and social media movements , who ende@@ av@@ ed to abol@@ ish laws for children before , followed on the foot and was happy with great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no concerns to say the critics of the children before they should take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition took care of ten@@ sions in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and sometime there were doubts about whether the opposition would agree to the bill . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against children before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of the opposition and an independent which could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would do him to the law . &quot;
&quot; now , only the president of the country must agree and declare the law . &quot;
&quot; one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave to Facebook a status update , which has once again posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle to Inst@@ ag@@ ram : &quot;
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : the bill against child before was approved in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and not one against it .
&quot; after having previously decided in the Senate , the design can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of social media users were thr@@ illed because the laws have finally been changed to children .
&quot; Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who held a minister of minist@@ ries in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has too much time and unnecessary to use the core of the thing , but do you know what ? the child before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now , and this is worth every price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel was the opinion of my opinion , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ e @-@ Thomas was over@@ lucky that the day was finally come : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ ic@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Excell@@ ent news ! &quot;
the sp@@ line network has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who hears the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society that spoke quite openly about it , as important as the adoption of the law said : &quot;
the married old age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent from the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; it was approved today , on June 9 , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; in the House of Represent@@ atives , there are 41 members and 35 of them were present at the vote . &quot;
&quot; all dep@@ uties , who were against the law , voted for the law . &quot;
the child &apos;s before is not legally allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ age@@ is@@ let .
many thanks to all the activists who have chosen him .
congratulations .
a thanks to our members .
&quot; however , a possible hook is therefore in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the secretary general of San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organisation of the country . &quot;
&quot; before months , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to under@@ take action , the law should be adopted , and he seems to resolve his promise . &quot;
&quot; during the General At@@ tor@@ ney of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a supp@@ orter of the law said it was quite right when Mahar@@ aj wanted to proceed against the law , most social media users wanted to go the debate on the subject . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell struck :
&quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of keeping the discussion as univers@@ ally , in a way that we invite you to talk about the problem , that the state that we may want to talk about the problem , our daughters against them would be ab@@ used , would you be willing to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you believe it is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether there is a court court against the law , or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s before in different gra@@ d@@ ations legal or remain the norm , although there are laws which they under@@ say . &quot;

created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for more than one month , Turkey un@@ lock the popular and based on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; day for day is clear@@ er , how important the platform is for users to find hel@@ pf@@ ull and reliable information . &quot;
both students and rep@@ orters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking .
&quot; although many techni@@ qu@@ eting Internet users are used to use creating tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from New York Times ) that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been closed by Wikipedia as recently as 2008 , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society has been hosted at Harvard University in 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to massive C@@ ens@@ orship by Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains closed , several Mir@@ ror@@ sites ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are often updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform made all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer network ( so computer calcul@@ ator ) , which is based on the system of domain name and thus makes a complete c@@ ens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; the contents , despite the legal prohibition , is rec@@ alled . &quot;
&quot; in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts : &quot;
&quot; after having heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything on it , snap@@ shots of Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility of read the contents on de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed manner . &quot;
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content even if they can &apos;t reach www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ wi@@ ktion@@ ary@@ .org website .
&quot; IP@@ FS also included that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it &apos;s only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to handle the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cri@@ sti@@ an Cons@@ onn@@ i from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has given both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ .org , an open source project , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to be similar in the country by Wikipedia . &quot;

&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy @-@ address , a Mir@@ ror . &quot;
&quot; you can access to another URL , which is not the original . that what you see is from Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; essentially , the server leads the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia themselves , if they are imprisoned in Turkey . &quot;
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .

&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , Nep@@ als are trying to bring to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his home place right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nep@@ als . &quot;
he described Facebook as it assi@@ sts this first @-@ class location in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park to a world heritage . what could be better for a passionate game of wildlife ! !
&quot; I rested just right at home when I suddenly cried in Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) , and he had received a call from my Father which would be a le@@ op@@ ard on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river . &quot;
the river dam is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran with my camera and was there a few minutes there .
&quot; my father watched him and showed me the place on the other river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was , and I immediately started to gn@@ p@@ sen pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar dispute a collaboration with the authorities to obtain global recognition for Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not so fear@@ ful as they look like .
&quot; and he should know it , because he stood by face to face to face : &quot;
a tiger can &apos;t distur@@ b by the opinion of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; I was also because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ he@@ k appeared . he immediately sets up , we see us and he star@@ red me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit : I click for environmental protection ) to his photos . &quot;
his passion for promoting Nep@@ al@@ as nature and wild animals is not always easy .
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to make the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings from Ot@@ t . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near tourist information . &quot;

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers - an award @-@ winning international community @-@ organization from India .
a revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women avoid women with greatest care , names of husbands , or even of older men in the family . &quot;
instead you use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hatt@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect her husband due to social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences , they should mis@@ use the norm . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced from the Indian state of O@@ rel@@ a by a criminal court and viol@@ ated her family and the village community after having addressed a married relatives with their names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives also does not call on behalf of name , is also common among men . however , they do not fear far less assign@@ ments if they do not come after this practice . &quot;
&quot; nine women , among them health staff and house@@ wives , were a unique club in the small village Wal@@ he in Pun@@ e , a unique club and became the main theme of the city . &quot;
&quot; it is a place only for them alone , where they discuss the enemy of the Patri@@ arch@@ ats and discuss . &quot;
&quot; as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and establishes itself for the dismant@@ ling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ola has been working for seven years with the help of their video camera to the discovery of intern@@ ships , such as children &apos;s heating up to the ban of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and leads this clubs . &quot;
&quot; it reports about how this club created a safe place for these women , and at the same time they have made it at the same time . &quot;
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini in her discussion round , acted by women who did not call her husbands at the name . &quot;
&quot; she decided on this topic , because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem which can easily identify the women . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t hesitate to pron@@ ounce the name of their husbands , is a brilli@@ ance that they may apply all inde@@ cent and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition means that a woman dis@@ respec@@ tful her husband and wishes him long life .
&quot; a woman who does not keep this , is considered a hin@@ d@@ ess , as a woman without mor@@ ality . &quot;
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we have never thought about this discussion round .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband , who had never seen her husband to try out at home , as it is running . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband still silent for a long time after the video was ended .
&quot; Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should call him out of his name . &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in Bag@@ ini started her first discussion lu@@ b .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that there was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women were protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to bring discussion with a practice in motion . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked any participant in to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , anno@@ yed , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked them all , &quot; If we can &apos;t say the name of our husbands , but they can call us how they want us to respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when she brought the name of her husbands on her lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra over the break of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which women never married the names of their husbands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells us :
&quot; a woman was so shy , that during the whole practice there was only in front of ones@@ elf ; another decided to release the whole fru@@ stration against him and his family , having cursed him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; in fact , in the A@@ dr@@ en@@ al@@ in@@ r@@ ink , in addition to an ancient fires , the women decided that they would really try to call their husbands at the name . &quot;
and they held their word .
&quot; in the coming days , Roh@@ ini received a multitude of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she sat in the head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it in dinner from the whole family .
&quot; her mother @-@ in @-@ law she was afraid , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understand@@ able and the situation art@@ ete in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reported how women tried to stop other practices , such as the carcin@@ oma of the red dot on the forehead , which shows the marriage status : &quot;
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would bear the interest of the red dot , if he would like it . &quot;
he only laugh@@ ed and I listened to him to carry him .
&quot; the other women didn &apos;t go completely with it , but they mean that they are now in a better position to choose it in some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion lu@@ b is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives . &quot;
&quot; we make a trip at any discussion lu@@ b .
&quot; normally , we take lunch and water and go out into the field . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t want to worry about the women who could hear , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; in the last months , they celebrated their own birthday with cakes for the first time in their lives , they sang and sang about things about which they never had thought before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have also made some things , for example , like our ident@@ ities in our husbands , never been so honest . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say some things loud , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
in a discussion round we talk about the concept of honour and as it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have carried out sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; most of them is the okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ man @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a tro@@ users ; they have not dar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; after much argument and discussion about the advantages of their own coat @-@ choice , mor@@ als linked with the Sar@@ is and much more , dirty Roh@@ ini her own couple Kur@@ t@@ as ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion round , so the women could carry them . &quot;
&quot; next , they now decided to plan an excursion to Go@@ a in which they can carry Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is certain that they will create it . &quot;
&quot; to the question , whether in the five months have already changed a little bit , Roh@@ ini confirms that things get slowly into rolling : &quot;
so far we have made little steps .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then stopped to say the name of their husband . &quot;
&quot; some of me included , do it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved . &quot;
only one or two will still say the names of their husbands ; only one or two women carry on each time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
the women in discussion lu@@ b know that the changes that they would like to reach them in their lives - like the bra@@ cing of more freedom of movement or your own coat @-@ choice - at the end of a hard to navigate river .
&quot; by turning each other self @-@ confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how to explain Roh@@ ini :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ats .
I am too .
but this club is each of us the confidence that something will change .
&quot; and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction if every woman is in the club home , and other people reported what we are talking about what we do . &quot;
we all sit in the same boat .

&quot; the people here is quite fast , that they had no other choice than the Beatles received with open arms . &quot;
many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when The Beatles arrived in Japan for the first time in 1966 .

it is the first time that successive attacks have been registered at dead men in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the goal of dis@@ or@@ tions for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 led a mission to investigate these practices .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , particularly in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government &apos;s campaign developed to fight against this super@@ st@@ ition and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;

free Bas@@ sel : Ne@@ ti@@ zen Under Seri@@ ous threat , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for medical treatment of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates and Dis@@ sident Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
&quot; a photo of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Liu X@@ ia , which was probably recently done recently . &quot;
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of incar@@ cer@@ ated by Chinese dis@@ sidents of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention to international community attention , after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he was hosp@@ itali@@ zed in the hospital for liver cancer . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Liu was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; ( state @-@ risk ) after he calls on the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o which calls for democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal matter &quot; and a spokes@@ man told it as &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless China continues to give calls to the international community , Nobel Prize Lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Liu X@@ ia , release or allow him a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others are totally out of the topic . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press offers some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
&quot; hands R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu . &quot;
&quot; a speaker , however , refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Liu abroad a treatment . &quot;
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway fell into the Sto@@ cks after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was awarded to Liu , although the Norwegian Government believes that this was nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
the diplomatic relations resumed only in December last year . Norway was first signed in June with Norway to go back to China since the exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
&quot; after the news was dis@@ semin@@ ated that Liu was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope to a unconditional release of and invited Liu , to get his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was not able to oppos@@ e his price . &quot;
&quot; during the ceremony , Liu was represented by an empty chair . &quot;
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution in which China was asked to release Liu and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplomatic at the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us , as it was told in an explanation on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet all visits and receive , which they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
USA
&quot; US ambassador Terry Bran@@ stad told him that the Americans would like to have the opportunity for treatment abroad , in@@ sof@@ ar as it was able to assist him in his gen@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; an spokes@@ woman of the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , gave the news agency AFP on June 27 that the message granted the Chinese authorities to liber@@ ate not only Liu , but also his wife Ms. Liu X@@ ia from their house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the US embassy was a fur@@ ious answer from China after himself , with the declaration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; no country have the right to have agreed and ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the couple the following :
&quot; protection and freedom such as travel agents and access to the medical care of its choice , which they are entitled to the Chinese Constitution and legal system , as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz introduced a decision in the Congress to push the Chinese government to push for it , Liu and his wife unconditional . &quot;
I challenge China to un@@ condition@@ ally release the Nobel Lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o unconditional to put himself into a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; the German government , Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , that Liu explains all the medical support he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping appeared on July 7th , 8th at the G20 summit in Hamburg . &quot;
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing of the news agency Reuters that China had great concerns whether the host could overs@@ ha@@ dow Liu &apos;s visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada
&quot; on June 28 , the Canadian ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um urged China to provide a reasonable medical care and give him the opportunity to give him to his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us lawyer told him previously that Li@@ us woman , Liu X@@ ia , could visit him every day but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers to talk and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells us :
&quot; Canada , calls on China to uph@@ eld its international human rights issues , including freedom of expression , dis@@ closed the rights of these rights . &quot;
France
&quot; France &apos;s Foreign Ministry urged China to release Liu on June 29th , Liu from humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments that he needs . furthermore , his wife and his family can contact him . &quot;
&quot; although the news broadcast France info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there will be no further information if France will eventually receive him . &quot;
Taiwan
&quot; Council &apos;s Council in Taiwan urged China on June 27 to release Liu , and demand a greater tolerance towards those that demand peaceful funds to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; in Taiwan , the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator called Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u from the ruling party called China also called to allow the sick of Liu , to be treated in Taiwan . &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed in a statement on June 28 about Liu very concerned and gave us that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us being well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Liu :
&quot; it is my faith that the initiatives that he accepted and for which he was strictly punished , led to a harmon@@ ious , stable and wealthy , which again had contributed to a peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally very moved and encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens inspired by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , Charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or Country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam should be considered as a town in Singapore .
this observation has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
&quot; during the conference on the occasion of a meeting at the international branch of the Bar Association of New York , the Minister said that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore as they compare Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he supports that Singapore should be considered as a city .
nobody asked whether New York is a democracy ...
&quot; this is , most people have a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io acc@@ uses the Minister of Justice to turn the logic of logic in order to defend the existing author@@ itarian Aid of power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and promotions to create this valuable country , you can say that we finally don &apos;t have any country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had an escape from the responsibilities , a mandatory injury . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could measure the political system of Singapore not with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of his , he appeared un@@ refused . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that become permanent from a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once you reach the theme of the subject , the good old bodies of the feasi@@ ble power emerg@@ es once again , leaving Democr@@ at democr@@ ats , leaving the twi@@ sted logic , because it fits better to its power . &quot;
&quot; the final week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam was given answers to its American guests regarding our press , our Ju@@ di@@ k@@ ative , our political system truly non @-@ answers . &quot;
relevant questions tar@@ ts with non @-@ answers r@@ ational species .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to illustr@@ ate his opinion because she didn &apos;t understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , so in which country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand . &quot;
&quot; I would be very thank@@ ful if our wer@@ ter K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take up the effort to clari@@ fy this point if he was paid high , to be part of the City of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; as An@@ on published his comment on the blog , it indicates that you should start to read the full address of the conference , in order to understand the context of the declaration of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and no country . &quot;
read the postal address .
&quot; as he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; city &quot; be considered a country , &quot; said he , why the elections in Singapore are so important , even if we are looking for free and appropriate elections . &quot;
he was able to win Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; he said that Singapore &quot; is not a country , &quot; he has not meant it in that sense ! &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam as leader of a growing generation that makes such pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am talking about what the Minister of Justice in Singapore has said ...
&quot; at least I knew about Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , which is expecting me - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s a different thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the Singapore leader of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not sure if he really believes it is true and aware of what he defended . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review Shar@@ es the vulner@@ abilities of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
did Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam have committed a mistake or was it a fre@@ er speaker ?
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are considered as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , on which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ? &quot;
Singapore is unique . it is equally land and city .
&quot; as he plays an important role within the government &apos;s government , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam is important . &quot;
&quot; why are the workers of Singapur their military service , but they only defend their own country ? &quot;
who must pay our prime minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink number ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; as a Dec@@ ade , the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade is declared that Singapore is always a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed a lot of Singapur ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; , etc . , but that &apos;s not quite true . &quot;
we should rather speak of the city &apos;s defense .

global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editors : what is the most mis@@ leading aspect of your home or homeland ?
&quot; their answers are published here as part of a continuous series , with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world and another facets should be shown . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ is Thom@@ pson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question that is made to me in Japan is : &quot; are you an American ?
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , and answer me . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 , I live and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation is taking place , it is regarded as pol@@ ite , interest in his conversation partners by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; in my clari@@ fication , the default answer follows : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice @-@ hockey , Nature . &quot; many Canadian women may cook inside with anger if they are kept for Americans , but don &apos;t b@@ other@@ ing me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know it , there is little that distingu@@ ishes our Can@@ adi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
&quot; this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans get a Canadian flag well visible on her ru@@ ck@@ sack when they travel . &quot;
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
American on the other hand ... .
&quot; so it was already when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Canadian have always worn little A@@ hor@@ n@@ heets on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons with us !
gay couples have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
we obviously say very often &quot; exc@@ use . &quot;
Canada is supposedly regarded as the toler@@ ant country on ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
firstly I have many American friends I &apos;m very ad@@ mi@@ red .
it would make me nothing if you would like to change with Johnny in Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first : as &quot; nice &quot; to be called , is basically to be sk@@ e@@ wed , but trag@@ ically un@@ important figure N@@ ed Flanders of &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has a Canadian citizen ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , it would be a step forward . but the real problem exists that &quot; nice &quot; does not have any personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing at which one can encounter . &quot;
harmless to be harmless and un@@ interesting to earn no attention .
&quot; this can be something good , if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , fer@@ na@@ b of the things that happen around one around . &quot;
&quot; I would even go as far as far as to say that the desire , free and alone , is a main character of the Canadian . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; the external standing as &quot; nice &quot; , &quot; is perhaps just a cool courtesy . &quot;
Canadian don &apos;t talk about the fence over the fence .
&quot; we are missing the warm , open kindness , which I joined with my American friends . &quot;
&quot; fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Justin Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice &quot; and our prime minister has almost made Canada . &quot;
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ ert Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a musical video published in Thailand has released a music video , which the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ ert who took power in 2014 and restore power in spite of her promises to restore civilian government . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells his rules to his girlfriend .
&quot; although not expressly politically , the music video refers to the persist@@ ently military power of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the band was praised by many fans and other users for their courage , to describe the situation of the country . &quot;
the video of the song was a huge success .
&quot; over the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook uploaded to 1,@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 Lik@@ es . &quot;
&quot; last month even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; dict@@ ator &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists led the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in particular , as it is the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; take a look at the video recordings of the video , which relate to some of the political topics that have been har@@ assed in Thailand over the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may include the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the preliminary Constitution , which makes the Commander in Chief of the He@@ eres absolute decision on important national topics . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of &quot; &quot; Change &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are regarded as critics from the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to re@@ define activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit in the army was established , supervised the online content and people accused of having s@@ lander the monarchy , had been prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand uses a strict sense against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ est@@ ät@@ s@@ bel@@ s ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the war was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
&quot; one of the problems , which continued to be followed by the Jun@@ ta , is their decision to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts warned them that the purchase is un@@ necessarily and a waste of tax . &quot;
&quot; in the video , it &apos;s even shown how people will be thrown into a black v@@ ans , before being put into an intern@@ ment camp . &quot;
&quot; some journalists sit in prison , because they allegedly causes &quot; confusion &quot; in society and causes them to re@@ prove long pen@@ alties , they should ins@@ ult the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the te@@ aser of the songs of the band , which was edited by Sal@@ ut , &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; who was already used by p@@ utsch opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;
life continues in the ruins of ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ ch@@ ies

&quot; the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri W@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society is re@@ covering only very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ ies , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it has passed over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ as@@ ic war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern districts in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive pictures .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the carbon basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Sil@@ gier and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
&quot; today , Russia &apos;s largest part of Russians and ch@@ ases live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called Gei@@ ster@@ lands in Ab@@ ch@@ ies .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in this ghost town . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of 16.000 people , after they had barely increased over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s , called the Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ schu@@ ko@@ w@@ kas , stands symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are falling and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he begins a conversation and it gets hard to finish this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why do I speak ? &quot;
it is still clear . &quot;
&quot; before the war , the village was full of life . &quot;
&quot; there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , which served all the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with infl@@ atable spl@@ endor buildings .
&quot; people who once lived in this place and paid their contribution to the central economy of the Soviet Union , have left the district meanwhile . &quot;
in the ghost town D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live about fifty inhabitants .
&quot; 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages , looks similar . &quot;
&quot; K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ ow@@ kas , which are still one or two families , one recognizes to the balconies where they are dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when she discovered me with the camera in the hand , they immediately withdraw . &quot;
&quot; our Mother has banned us , that we can take care of us , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; it simply is forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
&quot; the girl whis@@ pers on her friend , and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and van@@ ish . &quot;
many people work in the area for a small Turkish mining companies called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence industry ( cultivation of agricultural products for their own needs ) , like cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable construction . &quot;
it &apos;s difficult to come about the rounds .
&quot; in winter , the district administration provides candles and bread to the ham@@ lets . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini &quot;
&quot; about ten years ago , an older woman went with the name Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; in spite of her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left to leave her life to live with her . &quot; my heart is going to remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; she tells her . &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants to accept his daughter from her daughter and insi@@ sted that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly r@@ ents are just 9 dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden still a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; is she too . &quot;

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman , as well as a young family and I live in this building . &quot;
if holidays are we visit us .
but we can &apos;t do this constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears in the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calls T@@ ante G@@ alya her . &quot; &quot; they said , we could build zu@@ cchini . &quot;
I already prepared the floor .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as interview partners in Nat@@ asha together with her husband and the five common children lived in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they commem@@ orate the village of village in front of the war .
&quot; despite the relatives , which live in Central rus@@ sia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ ch@@ ies simply broke away ) , they didn &apos;t leave the opportunity to leave . &quot;

&quot; we recently purchased land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) , recently . &quot;
&quot; we want to build a house there , but that will take something new , &quot; &quot; she explains it . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives about $ 9 child money for every child .
her husband works in the Kohl@@ eng@@ ru@@ be .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ ascha &apos;s nursery was once found , they hold pigs , cows , h@@ aul and chickens . &quot;
it tells us that it was initially a very frigh@@ tening situation as many people left the village after the war .
&quot; but over time , she lost their fears . &quot;

&quot; we don &apos;t worry about the dark street , or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it actually has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
&quot; after the war , there was hardly any work and they lived like it was right . &quot;
&quot; every day , I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot;
&quot; as our conversation is turning , a little boy is over to us . &quot;
&quot; through the window of a destroyed building , it hi@@ des itself . &quot;
a ball fly from the window and another boy hun@@ ts to him .
&quot; he plays with the ball , which then rolls up the hill . &quot;
a group of children are now pursuing the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them throw away stones on the cas@@ eless building . &quot;
&quot; these ruins are a part of their childhood , which ensure in@@ fertility in their lives . &quot;
they do not know it differently .

&quot; in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey &quot;

&quot; this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and published here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; on the way of migrants attemp@@ ting to cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula . it is located at the border with Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city centre .
&quot; it is directed by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican , a small woman with a coral pink Br@@ illen@@ base and gold colored earrings in ted@@ dy bear shape . &quot;
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . yet they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather they themselves ) became a target for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on the transit .
the hotel does not have any charm .
&quot; for about 2,50 Dollar per night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with p@@ olls , crum@@ bled walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - but hundreds of African and ha@@ iti@@ an migrants arrive here .
&quot; sometimes Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at present it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
there are only 24 rooms . some have already slept outside on cardboard .
she wants to reject anybody .
&quot; she also helps them , and brings them to the hospital if they are sick , they buy them medication that they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m that exhau@@ sts from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived recently . &quot;
I asked him if mom is a reasonable nick@@ name for Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ ghurt ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her , since African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to get to Boston to re@@ locate her husband and her three children . &quot;
&quot; already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans , who are on the way to the United States , normally make a first stop in South America and then take the direction north . &quot;
&quot; the family had owned by other signs of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
&quot; he tells that the Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ cans often travel together , and that , Afri@@ cans already speak to What@@ s@@ App by Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; as many of its guide , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil in advance , and worked as a building worker at building sites of the Olympic Games and the soccer World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when Brazilian economy weak@@ ens the economy , he began its journey to the United States . &quot;
&quot; for months of guest he is a guest for Mama Africa : it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money , to buy the Bu@@ stu@@ et to Ti@@ juana . &quot;
I wonder if he is in the future with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez &apos;s future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always remain in touch . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells us that their guests often send text messages when they went , to gr@@ ate them or to report about the course of their journey . &quot;
it explains that their Christian faith is the drive of its work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have taught her , chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , perhaps known here is very known , but it is not the only spark for migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , a s@@ no@@ g@@ asse leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; in this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have recorded migrants in their small house . &quot;
he is Po@@ lic@@ ist and found that the bus@@ ses will be sold to numerous African migrants .
&quot; he started to help them a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking area outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I experienced what it will experience . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was referred to a raid on his desktop from the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents can open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
&quot; José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he had fled with his wife and his three children in front of the people who wanted from him money , without having a plan . &quot;
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , an omni@@ present , gave him her roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family lives and is still trying to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
&quot; in the gears , the trav@@ ellers are quietly under teleph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; a small bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away . &quot;
like a proud grandmother da@@ zzle her in her album with numerous photos .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair@@ styles that you have made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and elderly . &quot;
she laugh@@ ed sad while she pre@@ sides for me .

China : X@@ in@@ jiang inhabitants are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
&quot; a check @-@ Point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users , with additional structure of two , &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ in@@ jiang , a ethnic minority region in China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile users received a mobile phone notification in the Tian@@ shan district of Ur@@ um@@ qi , in which it indicates the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , the app is said that the app is to obtain access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities use the app for more than the com@@ b@@ ating terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h Women were arrested in autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because they had installed the app to be exchanged with a private We@@ chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the notification of the police , the app will determine the sources and the circulation routes of the terrorists , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online sc@@ am , Trojan and Ph@@ ishing pages to make users attentive how much time they spend online , and to control the own home network . &quot;
this app with filters for min@@ ors will help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can be used in various ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state &quot; or even h@@ acker could enable the home network of a person to manipul@@ ate or steal it . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
&quot; while messages about digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China usually focused on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often glo@@ om for those who live in distant ethnic minority regions such as X@@ in@@ jiang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme interest and monitoring measures , as well as rout@@ in@@ ous Internet shut@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the latest news from Main@@ land China &quot; &quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; &quot; ( on the top of the top of the airline China ) , the cen@@ sored news in China , showed photos from a check@@ point where police officers in@@ discri@@ min@@ ately checked the residents , whether they had the surveillance app installed . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that the people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are discovered at a chec@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for the technological development .
&quot; you have comp@@ elled the people to use devices that are intended for older people . &quot;
this is a form of captivity by the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China again .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( on the &quot; &quot; Stra@@ it &quot; &quot; Stra@@ it ) &quot; &quot; has also been published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , out of which the software can lift up the labels of a Windows operating system and thus obtain un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and cell@@ phones in X@@ in@@ jiang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council Council to minim@@ ize the distribution of illegal content .
&quot; all government branches , authorities and party connected institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security office at the operation of their computer and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned this new monitoring methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ in@@ jiang authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of Ur@@ um@@ qi a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs , until August 1 , their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media storage cards . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole number of other possible publishers , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : all cri@@ es after death &quot;
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane is his experience in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world you look at and stell@@ ar that you &apos;re alone on a place where everything is important . &quot;
&quot; everything has changed after and dissolved and revealed a truth , which is clearly visible , both inside and outside . &quot;
one that makes all honor their name .
one that has sm@@ itten down in a list of feelings and expressions that don &apos;t allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but when you come back the reality and looked behind the scenes , beyond the actors , the beautiful scenes and the per@@ formers - turn the characters into beings from flesh and blood , and everything is cri@@ es after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts appear in smoke , and you will be aware of your existence , even though the earth is on the axis of the heart . you will be sure that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone for stone . &quot;
&quot; they arrested me and arrested my father three times , but this was not enough to put my lesson &quot; like the chief of security services - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot;
&quot; he presented his power over us , saying that he even destroyed the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we knew . &quot;
&quot; five young people were torn apart from peaceful protest , like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution . &quot;
it brought out that the city was crushed the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
&quot; all the city districts sought , just my own not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , rainy , to the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that is up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their compli@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things were calm down after the power supply stopped to work in the neighborhood . &quot;
I crossed the silence by crying several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice opposed to silence .
&quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to cooperate . &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we were al@@ lied with a wonderful picture that filled my expectations . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment , you are aware that you have delivered the spirit from the lamp , but it is simply not interested in the smell . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; make you ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he laid up .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey can you be swallowed - nothing can return to you , after you have done it all the way to the office of security out of the body . &quot;
I arrived there .
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men , my father was already there as I was now . &quot;
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; let me hear , as you are &apos; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &apos; , or you are only cour@@ ageous enough to sh@@ out if we are not nearby . &quot;
his eyes met me .
&quot; and you have a dream of what to look for me in the eyes , and not on the ground . &quot;
what then did I did nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was on my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure when I replied : &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I have never stopped to look you into your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have been such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word from what I said . &quot;
&quot; he is in sol@@ itary and his father , with it . &quot;
&quot; like his father , his father . &quot;
the smell of this temp@@ t set me up to this day in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a spiritual torture which I was suspended for months . &quot;
I crossed the farm .
&quot; in the first office , I leave everything back with me . &quot;
&quot; afterwards again through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a gear to the single cells . &quot;
I prepared all the details exactly before I place the room .
otherwise they have assigned a bigger cell for me this time .
&quot; I have to share it with only one another prisoner , and may immediately put me immediately without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , who felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I took back on an old @-@ tried communication method : strike your fist against the wall . &quot;
I learned that my cell site was a &quot; Er@@ s@@ th@@ ek@@ ling &quot; .
&quot; after long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me . &quot;
apparently in no one of the surrounding cells was an este@@ emed man @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and is called the doctor .
&quot; in the perfect darkness , no distinctive facial features can be seen , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all only numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot;
all answers are one of its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the large cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
&quot; investig@@ ators assured me , they would be happy if I am staying . &quot;
li@@ ars .
&quot; happ@@ ily , I would have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive all these cro@@ ws to distribute the fruit in the garden of my head lab@@ s . &quot;
&quot; from afar , I always listen to &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be approximately 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always around this time , the cry , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the color of the destro@@ yer , until I presented the yellow light that told us the grave in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ unders , &quot; on the 13th of the Koran ) . &quot;
&quot; they are here , to be interro@@ gated . &quot;
&quot; thus the secret has been ventil@@ ated : to protect the state security before us and prevent the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in al@@ a@@ wit@@ e dial@@ ect . thus they played their conf@@ essions Er@@ pres@@ sive Pro@@ mp@@ se and promised the close field of view of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which is not a country ; it is a curse that they call Ko@@ exist@@ ence to turn to the crimin@@ als of their c@@ lans to a hero . &quot;
&quot; I looked after the hearing and tre@@ ad on Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender and sto@@ cky man . at least it comes to me . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that come from him : &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can begin with your life as to protest this day and protest at demonstrations , which will soon be found at the end . &quot;
I was not answered .
I used to acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to answer it .
&quot; I can really say exactly , when ins@@ ults and stro@@ kes after a friendly conversation for me to become an ordinary communication tool . &quot;
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
&quot; any voice in me told me that I had to get used to it , though I had done nothing , though I had done nothing to earn this punishment . &quot;
an appeal in all of its diversity .
&quot; his command is to plu@@ ck me as much flesh as possible from the body . &quot;
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; confession &quot; . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably dates from the sheet .
your hen folds on your scre@@ am .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him and you can &apos;t keep your scre@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; my scre@@ ams were not enough for him yet , why they exchanged the tube through a cable . &quot;
&quot; during my first arrest , I asked whether the investig@@ ators had worked as a gar@@ bage @-@ collector , or whether that belonged to the normal job equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables in each other , to present ourselves from their perspective , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within one hour , three of them changed , while I was still in the range . &quot;
&quot; I had lost all feeling in my body , and my voice also , why I listened to sh@@ out . &quot;
&quot; the Hen@@ ker noted the cooling , and found no pleasure in it , why he took the next to a electrically charged rod . &quot;
&quot; electricity through my whole body , enough to supply my whole quarter . &quot;
&quot; my semi @-@ bodied body , stretched out on the ground , was the perfect electric head . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
&quot; after two terrible hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night . &quot;
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again and sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; some hours passed , which came to me as minutes . &quot;
then call for the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning mist fills the room . &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sh@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I reply with the voice of one exhau@@ stible young people : &quot; &quot; my lord , my father must make fear@@ ful concerns . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and get away , you will be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they were always released .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b catch a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b brings most of his time inside ; sometimes he sm@@ elled to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
but what you can rely on is a cig@@ ar between his fingers or his with nic@@ ot@@ ine defiled lips .
&quot; he lives in the top of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel ended up his occupation of the West Bank and had been forced to escape from their village in Palestine , where they had lived as fel@@ low@@ lands ( about : farmers ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activist , who has surrendered to the conservative majority , and compl@@ ained about gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression . &quot;
&quot; with his music that often deals with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian ant@@ agon@@ ists , but also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics cannot only be found in his hom@@ etown Amman relev@@ ance , but also in cities that from Damascus in Syria to the whole of San@@ aa . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 25 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by limits and can help people with the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not exist openly , he performs a special abor@@ tion against US foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considers his art in his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion on those who are trying to do in war zones , something to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian ge@@ fle@@ dged of the second generation - so he himself describes himself , even though he was born in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own life circumstances so , &quot; st@@ resses H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I &apos;m a man , &quot; while he c@@ un@@ sol@@ dered in water . it is the holy month of Ram@@ ad@@ an ; it is the holy month of Ram@@ ad@@ an ; in that time it is intended for Muslims to fa@@ sten sunrise at sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ ad@@ an is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness for this to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee went little to protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the slaughter speak tep@@ id coffee and the v@@ ault of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose very first of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky , especially when you throw a look into neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it just avo@@ ids to do fundamental things - as in the public during Ram@@ ad@@ an water - to land not in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Interior Ministry announced its appearance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eila , already for the second time . &quot;
some parliamentary elections that support the Islamic State Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the homos@@ exual Fron@@ ti@@ ers Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no speaks to the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country and the main reason for the concert chart .
the MP and former press brie@@ fing of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN that the concert had been cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the S@@ ick@@ ers .
&quot; many claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous acti@@ vism , which represents the old @-@ proven legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian regim@@ es in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eila valued the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; which continued to be decided on an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement is probably not just the rhet@@ oric of rhet@@ oric , but indeed a clear , cryst@@ alline reality in Jordan was clearly reflected in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s work clearly . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional gender nor@@ ms came into body by forming his vision of the fate of Arabic women who have vo@@ iced sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an obvious unknown woman , whose arms and legs are up to the corners of the screen . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of them that they should trust . &quot;
&quot; in the past years , Jordan has increased the number of &apos; honorary mor@@ nings &apos; - the un@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; human Rights Watch according to Human Rights Watch reached its high point in 2016 ; however , it is still important that Jordan has become institutional infrastructure to support women who tried victims of murder or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law for breaking control of the year 1954 , women who are subjected to the danger of a family of famili@@ al violence , &quot; and for their release often a few long bureaucr@@ atic expenses , as well as the guarantee on the family is necessary that the woman is not going to happen . &quot;
&quot; also H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is well known for that , not to re@@ juven@@ ate topics in its country long as tab@@ u . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is politically , is a dream that he is his music , which is full of explic@@ it acts based on sexu@@ ality , freedom and opinion . &quot;
&quot; I come from the se@@ ost , man . &quot;
&quot; politics was sin@@ get@@ ed to me , &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question about the Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Lav@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; is the focus on poverty .
&quot; the list of songs , which are politically in@@ political , can be continued . &quot;
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title of &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
&quot; in this song , one verse is repeated often : &quot;
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the songs , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , in which one can get what you want &quot; &quot; be faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ gene@@ ity or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he not@@ ices that anyone speaks in Jordan on the rights of gay and les@@ bian and that comments on the equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still heavily cen@@ sored in 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian On@@ line@@ program Ro@@ ya to notice that his comments were torn from the context , twi@@ sted and cen@@ sored in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without inc@@ isions . but there was only a working version , &quot; he says . &quot;
today H@@ d@@ ai@@ b advert@@ ises the Arabic LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that int@@ oler@@ ance did not dis@@ agree to Islam .
&quot; he menti@@ ons Abu Nu@@ a , a poet from the eighth century , which still remains in memory thanks to its hom@@ o@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : when Abu Nu@@ das , who should work later on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could be writing openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ an@@ ians do that ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , did nothing with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eila or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the anti @-@ Sem@@ itic kingdom , there is nothing new that the government war@@ ts attacks on free expression of expression and that progressive vote will be put to silence . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service appointed several former government officials and members of the teaching associations , with the grounds that they had agreed on comm@@ ent@@ aries in social media crit@@ ically related to the problems with which deeply ro@@ oted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of what is the concert of H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs , only the tip of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to work a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ians . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress is a decent g@@ ossi@@ p and take off . Jordan has lasted for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - it looks down from slow , thou@@ ght@@ ful and inner changes . it is sure that these changes run from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arabs also dreams , from an Arab world without interventions abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dreams of bringing his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region can be governed by music , art and literature in real and fundamental op@@ enn@@ ess - and not by bombs , scatter@@ ing and to artificial nature . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until far , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to continue , and thus also resistance will afford . &quot;
this report was made by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting to hear the A@@ man as a student Fel@@ low .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these large , extra@@ vag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous the@@ ories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festivals .
&quot; one is presum@@ ed that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ kus took place and out of a period of time , in the armies of Japan invaded the northeast of Japan in order to force the indigenous population of the region , the Em@@ ishi , into the knee . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
&quot; you can imagine only hard , how large these parts are ... &quot;
&quot; a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( liter@@ al ) . &quot;
I &apos;ve been looking back to the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for long time : two fixed cars are straight to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only true - and to spend an amazing way to spend his summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a 18 @-@ meter @-@ high fixed car was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; seldom were external appearance and body care so important as in this history , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth of crime and promote a legitim@@ ate profession like those of the hair@@ dresser . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important harbor , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic centre of Lima &apos;s capital of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate where roads and illegal drug traff@@ icking are daily . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other middle and South American countries - rising demand for aesthetic services to men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sport@@ s@@ ers such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ esis ( Peru ) , and Ne@@ y@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to the more normal hands of hair@@ dres@@ s@@ ers to make these elabor@@ ate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event dedicated to the competition of hair@@ dres@@ s@@ ers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there are experts in each other to show , who can create of them the ec@@ cent@@ ric L@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos for current compet@@ encies can be found on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; education facilities such as the school Augusto Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to share their weapons against hair@@ dres@@ s@@ tools , and instead of bad coun@@ sell@@ or to obtain an apprenticeship within the hair@@ dresser making it possible to find work . &quot;
motivated of this activity and the possibilities of possibilities have seen dozens of young people who can seize a job that is currently in fashion .
&quot; at the beginning of March the school year , school offered special training workshops and reported some of its successes : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 we were the only school in the community and the district , which we are very proud of , because of love to the children we have built this education community . &quot;
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters

use with friendly permission .
&quot; the following article is the working version of the Beit@@ ra@@ gs &quot; Liebes@@ kind to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , who published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
the contribution will be published here within a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people who we know ?
&quot; isn &apos;t it a lot more import@@ antly , people who are out@@ cast out in future ? &quot;
&quot; this question went on the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga by the Young Youth Foundation and Cri@@ sti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to write the campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ cili@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) , which encour@@ ages young people to write gu@@ err@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; recently , her country was the place of an historical event and they wanted to help her part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace treaty with the gu@@ err@@ illa movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
international was considered as significant that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for its services to the Nobel Peace Prize .
&quot; still a long way ahead of Colombia , Colombia is still a long way to talk about real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who have lived for many years in illegal camps , were exposed to a rhet@@ oric and around the clock in their arms they have to re@@ integrate itself into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society again , which had used to life in constant fear and in some cases , has to record profound hatred toward gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , they now have to support them in their ranks and support them in the building of a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cri@@ sti@@ an were convinced that the young Colombia shall join together and help with the integration process .
and exactly that they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - lovers of former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them again in the company .
the campaign &apos;s goal is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters that will be personally handed over .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for reconciliation originated at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate , who took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there they had Leonardo and Cri@@ sti@@ an the opportunity to speak short with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we love the people who love to write to thousands of love letters , but those who forget it will need a lot . &quot;
&quot; he plan , he told us to share his love with people who needed the most urgent feedback . &quot;
&quot; thus , the plan , letters of hope and support for former milit@@ ants of the F@@ ARC , which now has to create their place in society and to create a new life . &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make dis@@ course of a war history to a common history of peace . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities throughout Colombia as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
I would never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ i@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ art traveled to the camp to personally revi@@ ve the letters . &quot;
&quot; the members of the F@@ ARC set up , as they had done earlier to oppos@@ e the commands of their leaders . &quot;
&quot; but this time they received no commands , but letters of under@@ wear from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for all those involved . &quot; it &apos;s unbelievable how many different feelings can run in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between , telling the political scientist of Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ nez Av@@ ila . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the governor of the Valle del Cau@@ ca Province described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after we had handed over the letters , a former fighter led me by the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters camp . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut , in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters live ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down , because beside him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ pomegran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; and I asked him , &quot; &quot; H@@ ello what are they doing ? &quot; he said , &quot; I reply to a letter that somebody wrote to me . &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never in my life someone has something so nice to me . that &apos;s why I answer it . suddenly the tears ran on the che@@ eks .
&quot; I embra@@ ced him completely , and set me beside the pomegran@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; perhaps he was sorry for the war , was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions of this kiss , and wanted to help him to write this letter . &quot;
the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else from life than war . the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I would never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
&quot; but now , I know that there is a society out there , waiting for us with open arms . &quot;
&quot; until now , I have only learned how I must deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace is rule , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; to the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together with a discussion round . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC already invaded the secret .
&quot; therefore , the leader of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insights into their views about the peace process : &quot; many years we have experienced how we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help to create the society in this country more fair . &quot;
&quot; for a target of this magn@@ itude , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; those people hear that so far had never been heard and had no electoral law , and to recognize that the people who I often had seen as monster and even hate them , even people with beautiful emotions , who were turned around by their life and the environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality , in which the country is living , hur@@ ting to me . &quot;
&quot; but it comforts me that all men - even those who have caused and caused much harm to us , can give us a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters have answered the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the arch@@ bishop of the city Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian has been made , that after de@@ fo@@ rest@@ ation peace would reign . &quot;
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will be always people who are ready to engage in arms and protest to their rights . this is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we are putting out by the F@@ ARC now on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what breed , religion or ideology they hear - will dre@@ aming of all those who dream of a country in the war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and sacrifice , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence , many difficulties are im@@ min@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but we will overcome them together . &quot;

&quot; homos@@ exual and que@@ er people living in the Caucas@@ us region , are exposed to a large range of dangers - among other things discrimination , physical and sexual violence and ext@@ ortion . &quot;
&quot; in terror , activists have experienced the coverage of the last months on persecution of gay men in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but the threat , which depends on the LGB@@ T@@ Q community , is not only about the night . &quot;
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what happened in the republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya has captured the international headlines in front of several months after reports were published , the to@@ wing , torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic of them@@ at@@ ised . &quot;
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the No@@ wa@@ ja Gas@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities that susp@@ ects men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world , &quot;
&quot; Sabrina , a trans@@ wife , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny , and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; ever since her childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; when she was grown up , she became aware that Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
after a group of Che@@ chens experienced by the gene@@ alog@@ y of their land wife , hunting was opened to Sabrina . &quot;
they are afraid of fear for their lives in the USA .
Sabrina : I was working as a volunteer hel@@ pers at a human rights organization .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ lators that were in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took it without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , he thought of whom I thought he was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere on the internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . he gave them no more men in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya that can eliminate these dis@@ grace ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos taken from my documents through the whole App round the round . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was just doing this , I heard a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt me . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; how long will you honor the family ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I only know that there was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost the consciousness and a@@ woke up last du@@ des in the hospital .
apparently some women had everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had a ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I experienced that I had two head@@ ings in my right lung s@@ wings . &quot;
OC Media : in which cases were you laid down - in men or women ?
&quot; Sabrina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , there &apos;s still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very grateful for that .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Caucas@@ ian name . &quot;
but he turned out as a good man .
I am grateful to him that he is respec@@ tful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
&quot; last February , I got threats . &quot;
&quot; they call me , wrote me - Rel@@ ated , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was attended by neighbours and some remote relatives .
&quot; the requested to send me back to Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya , to prove that all is a lie . &quot;
&quot; they presented absurd claims : some said to me , I have to prove it , going on the top without through the streets ; others wanted me that I had not changed my sex , that everything was only bad , and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have grain size C - what would I have to say in television ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it &apos;s still difficult for them .
some elderly people said once my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , that not only your family , but the whole republic . &quot;
&quot; we can &apos;t touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; my mother became too much , and she laid a rope around his neck . &quot;
fortunately the neighbours came and saved them .
&quot; at the time , I had to change the apartment several times a day . &quot;
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later under the window got a car with the dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 .
&quot; after the third time it happened , I was clear that there was something la@@ zy . &quot;
my human rights activists examine the number@@ ing signs - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give their names , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really have helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help , I left the country , but then something un@@ belief . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
&quot; I bought it without record , without ID , without ID . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the tr@@ ash .
arrived at and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a strange woman .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by What@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think about , you heat in safety , just because you have left the country ? &quot;
people already know in which hotel you pass . you even know your room number .
only to prove it : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , however , this is a tab@@ ulated . &quot;
some traditionally Caucas@@ ian elements I still bear in me .
&quot; as much as I wish it , these se@@ el@@ ic barrier can &apos;t overcome . &quot;
&quot; I always say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to do them . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I actually give myself hard to look like the person who remembers them from their past - so to my male form . &quot;
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends do , those who have stayed ? &quot;
Sabrina : I filed a report in Washington last week .
&quot; for this , I needed more information about the situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya . &quot;
I talked to someone who had one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that Ram@@ ad@@ an had not been arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of the Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait , and he did not lock a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will focus on family and family .
&quot; so I mean , they probably invite the relatives , these care about the problem with the affected person and at the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; has experienced by blood gen@@ ug@@ ging . &quot;
OC Media : will there be gay men in these secret pris@@ ons too ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine says there would be not many .
&quot; if , especially those who have no rich relatives , or those of their relatives have been forced to place the Kad@@ y@@ rows court . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they will be held there , that one can present them as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : should they be killed , they will show their bodies in television and claim that they would have attacked any village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , but specifically di@@ pped to radic@@ alize itself . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : is this only a assumption , or have you a source for this information ? &quot;
Sabrina : I &apos;ve just had someone who was imprisoned in a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he says that many people had disappeared in this prison , after their be@@ ard had grown . &quot;
there has been nothing new from them since .
they simply have taken them .
and this so @-@ called Lord ; this person was taken with himself when these people were taken .
&quot; however , until now they were not introduced as band@@ its , there were still no experiences yet . we susp@@ ect that such actions are possible . &quot;
why would I not have allowed this people to shave ?
&quot; do you know if these persecutions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who have a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , have already been visited in the past ? &quot;
Sabrina : I always wore my hair long .
&quot; in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya , I had a Bob . &quot;
&quot; I think , already in 2003 I was already known in the whole Great , when I lived there - and I never had problems . &quot;
in Ernst !
&quot; from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sch@@ aria was considered , I never had problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia wanted to lead us originally to the &quot; civi@@ liz@@ ing , &quot; but ultimately thrown us back to the stone time . &quot;
OC Media : what is it possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sabrina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were hat@@ ched ; I had coloured eyelashes , wore Rö@@ hren@@ je@@ ans and short Tops . &quot;
the Security Office of Sh@@ aria never has a hair curved for me .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every night , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew it , and knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we were never ins@@ ulting .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a promise : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; mo@@ ck is not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
&quot; it is often said to children , when they are fun on sick . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : so they simply have their eyes closed before you , because they believed , they are sick ? &quot;
Sabrina : yes .
&quot; they never off@@ ended me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did these gifts begin ?
Sabrina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began talking about mor@@ ality in television . &quot;
&quot; he was not talking about us , but pre@@ dict@@ ated about the behaviour of women . &quot;
nevertheless - you could feel like people in the city began to change .
&quot; who had ridicul@@ ed and laugh@@ ed , looked at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion . &quot;
during the time I left Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya .
&quot; every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the republic was constantly tigh@@ tened . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA are not much .
&quot; apart from that , I am still working as activist activist . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I testim@@ oni@@ ans with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we perfectly organize te@@ ac@@ ffs , past@@ ing together , I join them to hospital and help them to get food cards . &quot;
I have no p@@ enny for this .
I discovered this people himself when I cl@@ ut@@ ate random variety .
I am Muslim and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : that is al@@ lied .
&quot; so , nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
this is exactly the same as Che@@ chens I want to do with foam in front of the mouth that there are no fl@@ aps in them .
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ an have those who have the Cab@@ ar@@ din@@ er , who have the Russians also have what ; on the whole planet it is - but not in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I come from there , therefore it is un@@ pleasant to hear what to hear . &quot;
I meet here so many men from the Caucas@@ us .
many of them - pract@@ ising Muslims who go to the mosque and fa@@ sten in the Ram@@ ad@@ an - live together with men .
&quot; do you know , many think about tran@@ sid@@ y of men who love males , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that is a tru@@ ste@@ er . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of sens@@ ations to be precise , different living settings . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is most important to feel me in my own skin and not be ashamed for my body . &quot;
not whether I have a partner or not .
&quot; I &apos;m sorry that I will be so personal , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I myself am myself .
local groups warning an increase of suicide in the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high working class and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last months , there has been a strong increase in suicide . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 , the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , characterized by poverty and unemployment . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the south @-@ west of Iran .
&quot; he suffered anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness that can arise in@@ ability to his family such as Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups who work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; a video , on YouTube , held the moments after he had kind@@ led himself . &quot;
&quot; some people made it fast to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the valley of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the com@@ bu@@ ations were so strong that doctors could not do any more . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only suicide who invented themselves in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists warned that more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights reported that some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - executed this month . &quot;
&quot; their stories have a thing in common : they were all family members who felt hel@@ pless and in@@ capable due to their persecution on the Iranian government , hel@@ pless and unable to pursue their families . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , which is a large part of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community based in Iran , was sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard to deny its living . &quot;
&quot; before a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was an especially autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took power over and 1925 major efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran present in @-@ coming oil and gas fields , as well as some of the most important and most valuable resources for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite this valuable resources , the regional economy is still developing only slowly , and the indigenous population gets little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and waste . &quot;
&quot; in the Iranian regime , Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arabs have systematically denied jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government also built a variety of dam@@ s , the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian Are@@ as , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ hom . &quot;
&quot; these dem@@ me have led only to destroy the region due to dr@@ y@@ ness caused devast@@ ation , and local agriculture as well as fish and pal@@ ms industries . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi @-@ adolescents now increased to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for cooperation , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is , who completed a job , completed the primary school , 55 % completed a secondary school . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that leads the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; led to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ men . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ him@@ i said , that especially the unemployment has become worse and worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of Ah@@ wa@@ z emerging ethnic Persian and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the creation process : &quot;
&quot; since officials and institutions pre@@ fers a non @-@ Arab labour force , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will have access to working possibilities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is a part of a systematic politics of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs , and to earn their lives outside of their home Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their pre@@ ferences and sur@@ names to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , as even Arab names are not toler@@ ated at the workplace , because the speaking of Arab language or the dreams of Arab clothes are not toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer , h@@ itting human rights activists , before the situation is explo@@ sive . &quot;
it remains to wait if the world w@@ akes up and being aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is un@@ treated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avo@@ id@@ able .

&quot; why I do not identified myself with femin@@ ism , also with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot;
detail of a photos . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons License .
the following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the A@@ fr@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was an object of several discussions in which many different positions arrived .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am no femin@@ ist , many women - in particular white women , signi@@ fy themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
you wonder why I &apos;m not part of the movement .
they even thought well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments from me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we should be able to be all femin@@ ist * inside .
&quot; for example , women still earn less money in spite of equal education than men . &quot;
&quot; women are still under str@@ ingent observation , when it comes to what they are allowed to do with her body . &quot;
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
&quot; or that cultural and social nor@@ ms are still ensuring that women sooner or later in various fields of life on a glass ceiling , and that discrimination based on the sex is still across the many different countries and belie@@ fs . &quot;
all this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I am double and thre@@ e@@ fold .
I am a black woman .
&quot; nevertheless : when I come to my skin color , on the black C@@ is women , on black C@@ is women , on black C@@ is women , on black women in the LGB@@ T@@ IQ @-@ community or on black women , on which kind we have been physically mis@@ used , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists left and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; but nevertheless , they all agree that women - all women - should come together to sing &quot; their voices , and &apos; Kum@@ b@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing , to achieve equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about that , in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is a institutional form of rac@@ ist violence that we are exposed to black women on two times . &quot;
or above that black women and women of other eth@@ nic@@ ities and arrivals are less than white men and women .
&quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to as white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black sp@@ ouses and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk , domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I want all women , all males , and all men who have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t connect the same rights as black as the white woman who ref@@ uses to take care of the skin as well as to the skin color of one person . &quot;
&quot; I am exhausted and won &apos;t fight for my belonging to a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere , which always turned me and countless other black women . &quot;
&quot; when So@@ jour@@ ner accused 1851 in her speech , &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a horri@@ fied and mar@@ g@@ able being . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join the group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs , to absorb their eg@@ o@@ ec@@ cent@@ ric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to settle white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping of skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to revi@@ ve them . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to be a home to women of different interest and to mar@@ gin@@ alize itself from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; Femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself full and completely from femin@@ ism and to connect the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was to use me for my dark skin and my status as a woman who is so stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly , that interfer@@ ed as a novel phenomenon is celebrated . &quot;
&quot; it is more important than ever before that we define black women to our own ideas , and we will go to the sp@@ ouses that are created from us for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ an@@ ism : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing O@@ ur@@ selves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism ) tells us that we can defend ourselves by our own way , in which they can be completely safe in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be ad@@ mi@@ red . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists immediately invo@@ iced separ@@ ati@@ ism and exclusion after they read these lines , I pray you about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradi@@ ctions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because in this para@@ dig@@ m I exist .
&quot; due to my dark skin , I will be recognized as a part of this para@@ dig@@ m as a part of my para@@ dig@@ m . &quot;
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life wasn &apos;t persu@@ aded , nor is rejected . &quot;

&quot; Maikel Nabil Mus@@ a traveled over the past 7 years - mostly with surf board or in can@@ oe - with a particular concern through the Kurdistan region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of clean waters to present and future generations . &quot;
&quot; in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a who declares us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the effect of pollution in its congregation . &quot;
&quot; I definitely want to do something for the river we lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a tells . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Water@@ ke@@ epers Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ art@@ ender Alliance - which aims to protect the rivers , streams , and water paths in Iraq , as well as local municipalities in the sustainable use of this natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ ises the st@@ ing@@ iness and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we don &apos;t have water more , how would we survive then ? &quot;
&quot; this video was filmed and edited for En@@ sia von Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bi@@ l , in Iraq and a multimedia journalist . &quot;
&quot; the emphasis on their work is followed , little remarkable sub@@ cultures and is characterised by using co@@ oper@@ atively video photography and new multi @-@ media techniques that can tell their help with their help to tell their stories in their way . &quot;

the following article is the shortened and working version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of cur@@ tur@@ ally . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ j@@ er ( # vari@@ ance women ) which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect the affected persons .
&quot; a police Commissioner said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her sp@@ ouse who had become violent to violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of its relationship , a little time has passed and the police said , their statement would be put to the acts , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; as another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed , because of ab@@ uses , also the ak@@ ten@@ ant display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez did not use anything . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second wife moved back to her ad . &quot;
to break the v@@ icious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; when women do not want to display at all , they do not receive support from the State . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also fin@@ anci@@ ally dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence at all at the prosecution en@@ forcement agencies . &quot;
&quot; input 1 stro@@ kes and Stati@@ stic 2 Un@@ seen ab@@ uses and a legal system , which nothing prohibited under 3 of the laws : good approach , lacking implementation of stro@@ kes and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is hard to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , a social research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports that show the magn@@ itude of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains . &quot;
&quot; the numbers , however , are al@@ ar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , according to the Office of the Public Prosecutor , 9@@ 600 ads were charged with domestic violence . 70 % of them went to violence against women . &quot;
86 % of advertis@@ ements during the police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5,000 ads because of domestic violence in the peace of peace . 86 % of the messages came from women . &quot;
&quot; in the indications , 40 % of the women were physically re@@ mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of the women spoke of psych@@ otic ab@@ uses . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics show not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di indeed , only few of these crimes are actually displayed . &quot; &quot; every woman who is re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; there are two women who do not do this because of physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; she stated at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay was not a separate crime , the prosecution authorities could not be adequ@@ ately documented , as many women will be murdered every year from their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; until August 2016 , journalists included at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country . &quot;
&quot; the Coordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases , in which women were murdered by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay all ten days a woman died due to violence by men . &quot;

invisible Mis@@ uses and a legal system that takes nothing
&quot; before Mariana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the strong friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the name of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do it , but then . this should always regret it . &quot;
&quot; today , Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years , she bore the psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recogni@@ zable by the most severe : &quot;
I never thought I would have been a victim of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that this only happens to under@@ take women because they are dec@@ eive from violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen to me .
Mariana uses social media to report about the abuse through Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , they wrote contributions to Facebook , in which they described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told how he was isolated . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos itself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ical if he ever collected the hand against them and refused to prove that his behavior was also a form of ab@@ uses . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users were asked to Mariana , why they did so long by Carlos , and left him not earlier . &quot;
&quot; it seemed almost like , as they wanted to say that victims of ab@@ uses were at least a certain complic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; Victoria Santos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ated . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o @-@ CRE@@ O network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women all in any way victims of ab@@ uses .
&quot; in the group , they can speak with others about their experiences , listening to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the declar@@ ations of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything began with psychological abuse .
&quot; ultimately , her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he began to beat them .
&quot; in the authorities , Vict@@ ori@@ as ads stayed with the authorities without a result and even from their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; she led a process against her former partner who developed to an un@@ mistak@@ able jur@@ ist struggle between Paraguay and her home country , where it was mainly about money , power and influence of their former partner . &quot;
&quot; the laws : good approach , defective implementation &quot;
&quot; there are many laws in Paraguay , which are very good but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the advertisement of ab@@ uses is a way of resi@@ du@@ es and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , sees great problems with the application of laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , in the par@@ agu@@ an parliament , the bill was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ El@@ la ( # Für@@ sie ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ Una@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original bill of the bill looks to explain fem@@ izi@@ d to an independent criminal off@@ ense and pun@@ ishing harder than pun@@ ishing the case in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; so the legisl@@ ature has changed in some points to win the members for the law , which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions , which are currently banned in Paraguay and sentenced to five years in prison . &quot;
&quot; the original bill was provided to charge the majority of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) process , which must present the victims of violence at present , if they just wish to receive a secure and secure accommodation to the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ature does not provide sufficient financial resources to provide :
&quot; in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ l is seen as part between human relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking has to take place , that violence is no longer considered a little bit . &quot;
&quot; who , in view of these facts , ple@@ dged to be found guilty , and contributes to that the perpet@@ rators will be gone away . &quot;
we need to report so long indication until abuse are no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the Law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been altered , but among other things , a passage in cases of domestic violence was called for reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions about the changes go apart .
&quot; the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for ag@@ gres@@ sor , to attack his victims . &quot;
&quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent Media in Oman a year after prohibition of a newspaper continued to attack attacks
&quot; this website was closed due to a decision of the information minister &quot; &quot; on the homepage of banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than one year ago , the authorities signed an independent Arab newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its reporting on corruption in the s@@ ult@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he served a year prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ al Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and tried in court , but later returned . &quot;
&quot; since 1970 , Oman has ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn Said , who came to power after he had set his father , Said i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur , caused by a heads of state . &quot;
&quot; since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the main offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Chief Commander of the Armed Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the s@@ ult@@ ation of the Sultan is characterized by the insi@@ di@@ ous efforts of security forces , in particular the domestic intelligence , by public freedom , including press freedom , restri@@ cting and human rights , independent journalists , blo@@ gger and other activists to fol@@ ly and incar@@ cer@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; authorities believe peaceful and legitim@@ ate activity in human rights systematically and citizens , also activists , to remember their views on the public matters of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and imprisoned three of their Edit@@ ors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
&quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported on Cor@@ ruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) since its foundation in 2007 , until they were banned by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on July 28 , 2016 security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , announced his article entitled &quot; High @-@ Day parties &quot; hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . in this way , an article entitled &quot; high @-@ ranking parties of justice &quot; was published in the Ju@@ di@@ ci@@ ary and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused of raising the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to raise a verdict in an inheritance dispute . &quot;
&quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n from July 26 , 2016 with a report on the front page with the heading : &quot; high @-@ level parties bind hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ ra@@ Al @-@ Abr@@ i , Member of the editorial board , was invited to the special department and was arrested by the security forces at his arrival . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS drew Chief Editor of You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who was hired as Chief Editor for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed on an in@@ definite period , after the information ministers had given the order that &quot; the publication and dis@@ sem@@ ination of the newspaper on all paths , including online , will be prohibited from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first negoti@@ ation was held in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
the court sentenced the three journalists in prison terms and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convicted of things because of the order of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the State &quot; . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of violation of a public law and s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j was sentenced to three years of prison terms and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ ic ri@@ pen@@ alties ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , one year@@ ling professional ban against the two journalists were hanged . &quot;
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year jail and a fine of 1000 ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after using the use of an information grid to spread the material that could be a danger for the public order .
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a b@@ ail ( 13 000 US dollars ) was fixed on 22 August 2016 , and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the Appeals Court acquitted Al @-@ Abr@@ i at a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after the arrest of his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his sentence in prison .
the Appeals Court also took the decision of the Federal Ministry of Justice to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; in spite of the decision of the Court , Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper sees after attacks caused by the Iranian government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Information Minister dismissed an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the information ministers signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , giving himself a further time against the decision of the Appeals Court to allow the publication of the newspaper again . &quot;
&quot; the constant closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases , in which in Oman at recent times the press freedom was injured . &quot;
&quot; for further injuries , for example , the closure of the independent magazine Mo@@ w@@ in and the exercising pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to hire its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the last closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to prepare the extensive violation of the press freedom . &quot;
Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the anom@@ ali@@ an authorities : &quot;
1 . release You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and unconditional ;
&quot; 2 . to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can continue their work ; &quot;
3 . protect the press freedom in the country and
&quot; 4 . in all circumstances , human rights defended and journalists in Oman must un@@ hin@@ der their right human rights and without fear of gas@@ k@@ ening measures , including a judicial en@@ ik@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , as well as independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf area and neighbouring states , as well as the right to gather peac@@ efully , supporting and protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ concep@@ tions
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , with his agreement &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; there are two reasons for the demand on site , there are two reasons : for a missing in the offer of the global healthcare industry , many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria have in the poorest countries of Africa far more serious effects than elsewhere , and lack of investments in the exploration of these diseases by pharmaceutical companies are a big problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research , which is carried out by African scientists himself will be involved in the building of its own research capacities in Africa . a major role in science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Expl@@ oration of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic showed first gra@@ dation effects on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Louisiana , later in Indiana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he explored the HIV virus until he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ b@@ ische healthcare system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ concep@@ tions of media about this research . &quot;
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as an individual ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research theme ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ b@@ ische national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I launch a research program for development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB , and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens . &quot;
g@@ v : what are your opinion about the important science topics in your country and in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always remain receiver instead of being M@@ acher . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that we get , are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it &apos;s impossible to use it here . &quot;
g@@ v : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are different well .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or get there , because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
g@@ v : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you didn &apos;t have ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a contin@@ ous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
g@@ v : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are interest in interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods were taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; g@@ v : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need of special academic education , starting at every age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , exploring the space of space , health care ( non @-@ transferable and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit . &quot;
&quot; g@@ v : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as scientists in Africa from western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
RW : often it is the limited speed to do things ; and the maximum access to scientific expertise that are here challenges .
&quot; the system that magazines are only accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change the global food production
&quot; Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky &apos;s contribution was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been bred in the United States since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 flav@@ ours , such as out@@ breaks , the first plant grown by NASA ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space and has been devoured . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was made only by his own in@@ fest@@ y@@ ons and the question how many sal@@ ts of salads can be set to borders . &quot;
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s he noticed that more salads were patented and that he could not use it further to bre@@ eders .
&quot; patents are not only for individual varieties , but also for specific characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or green leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more of these patents have been registered for ever more plants such as grain or cartridges . based on this trends , plant bre@@ eders , environmental protection and non @-@ expert food safety provide for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mort@@ on still breed let@@ tu@@ ce , however he needs longer , because his work is always worth more and more limitations . &quot;
&quot; it is , as would lie in a river a rock bro@@ kes , to whom I have to pump . &quot;
&quot; so we have to do that now , but it &apos;s a break with breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents will go on salads . &quot;
&quot; and when they stand before the court , nobody can breed any more of a new sal@@ at@@ variety , because all the features are already patented . he makes it as good as possible and tries to breed those characteristics that he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and ende@@ av@@ our to use any material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he joined a movement that is getting bigger in the United States and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) . &quot;
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred red Rö@@ mer@@ s@@ ate of the variety Out@@ red@@ ate in &quot; greenhouse gas station &quot; and ate where plants can be cultivated in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like it would come from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software to make alternatives to copyright protected software .
&quot; it was founded in order to ensure that some plant species and gene are not protected as intellectual property , and so for plant bre@@ eders is permanent . &quot;
&quot; as part of the initiative , just called O@@ ss@@ i , U.S. re@@ bre@@ eders may under@@ take that others may be able to use the seeds of them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to make business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders allow only others to breed their seed , and it will not be re@@ adily available - two aspects that are banned by many plant pat@@ ents . &quot;
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; for emer@@ itus professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to him , seed plays an important role in larger merge , such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to avoid the latter not or not only little by spreading seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture , or not . &quot; &quot; who &apos;s good , locally sour@@ ced and sustainable producing vegetables should also know that the way around farmers should also be cultivated in August or September 2016 . &quot;
&quot; clean @-@ sovereign , without seed , is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative also under@@ take to make other seed remains freely available . in contrast , their advantages in contrast to plant seed and plant characteristics . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argu@@ ed that the future of food supplies is at risk as the available Gen@@ pool due to the increasingly numerous spiritual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always available unlimited . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , the O@@ ss@@ i &apos;s Director of O@@ ss@@ i , has found himself in her thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all card features are protected as intellectual property , which is either not or less usable for plant bre@@ eders . &quot;
&quot; for other plants , there are such estimates not yet , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass@@ aging plants as wheat in even greater style are patented than salad or carrots . &quot;
a Question Of Vis@@ itors
&quot; plants are so far@@ med that they have targeted features - from such , through which their taste or their color improves up to such , due to them in certain environments , and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of pat@@ ents at plant characteristics indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders is steadily decreasing by more patents . however , genetic diversity is currently unnecessary as ever since the changing conditions caused much worse than the climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an email address , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokesperson Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknowledge that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos &apos;s activities . with a total of four Gen@@ ks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture , the United States changed the company for the preser@@ vation of genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , they contradi@@ ct that intellectual property has other bre@@ eders including &quot; patents and the protection of plant diversity innovations &quot; . &quot; a patent is basically taken a plan that everyone can follow soon as the patent has expired . &quot;
&quot; often , these instructions also help others to come with another method for the same result . &quot;
&quot; such protection is not in@@ hib@@ ited to innovation , but promotes them to be provided with the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on looks different : 20 years to wait , until a patent pending , it is certainly no innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait for so long to breed in plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have lost the fight . &quot;
&quot; the main argument for Mort@@ on is , however , that genetic resources always have been a general thing and continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary inc@@ enti@@ ves are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want to make farmers easier .
&quot; that is what inspired us , and it is impossible to use us if we do not continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mort@@ on is distur@@ bed on the concept of experim@@ enting the plant characteristics : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics . &quot;
&quot; the plants origin@@ ate themselves from and as bre@@ eders , we have no idea how the plants do that . &quot;
a mystery of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant bre@@ eder in the U.S. state of Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who is a variety that chast@@ ens his own values in them . &quot;
&quot; who believes on industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , who are needed to grow up Her@@ bi@@ oci@@ des in which the cultivation of this concept is cultivated in agriculture . &quot;
my concept is accurate . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized businesses ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than for Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , it will create most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either to reject it or keep it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding , or both are the case . &quot;
the independent plant bre@@ eders Frank Mort@@ on looks at Sal@@ ate in his breeding garden .

&quot; Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eders by avo@@ idance of vegetable pat@@ rons : &quot; it looks like I &apos;m making new effort to produce new , stronger than the company . &quot;
&quot; I do constantly need new material for my catalogue , since I know my competitors can sell my varieties in a few years ago , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; with a patent it is easy for 20 years before the competition . &quot; &quot; worldwide reson@@ ance &quot;
&quot; although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading quickly around the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which itself describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , is a &quot; open @-@ source seed plant &quot; centre and helps them to breed new varieties , meet the specific requirements . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seed and sell their own .
&quot; the German organization Agre@@ l operates at an &quot; open source &quot; licence , which ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i commitment to bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( regulations for bre@@ eders differ from land to land , absent due to the O@@ ss@@ i obligation is not just one can be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conventi@@ onally bred plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European patent . &quot;
&quot; there is no explanation , but there is no law ; now it is to the governments of the Member States to implement the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os organized a conference to &quot; Open Source &quot; seed companies in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and seed companies from all East Africa to learn something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards Pat@@ enting of seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for the &quot; Open Source &quot; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems that the organisation is currently being set up a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems for the scheduled next year of the official starting signal . &quot;
&quot; a merger from environmental protection and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non @-@ profit organization US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food and organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - will represent the view that farmers should have the opportunity to make it a stable supply of food security . &quot;
&quot; in the report , the importance of a diverse , local supply with seed for sustainable food systems is emphas@@ ized - a link between the Lu@@ by of O@@ ss@@ i hopes to recognize him soon . &quot;
&quot; the motion for regional and ecological food is particularly respected , where and how little is grown , and seeds are hardly played a role , &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest objectives of c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities have still un@@ lock content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
&quot; the Egyptian government reported the website of the Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which reports human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt as well as the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook in which it critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue working and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the new Network for Human Rights Information unle@@ ash - despite this attack and the violation of the Egyptian law and the Constitution through the authorities that the law had to defend and give up a voice in this part of the world , even though it was never so difficult to overcome the blocking , and not to give up . we hope to meet our task further . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked off more than two months of 21 websites , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ speaking edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jazeera network for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of woven bul@@ locks into victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , this is no access to the blog of the colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights scientist Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada . &quot;
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of colum@@ ni@@ es and articles that he has no accessible websites and media in Egypt .
&quot; now , the blog , which he set up in order to handle the C@@ ens@@ ur@@ ate of the Egyptian government , itself the objective of the attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider is native to Canada &apos;s blog , however , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after having been arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he recorded a video about the student &apos;s physical violence against two students . &quot;
his article turn mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed itself on the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; however , to lock blogs is very old , but has no priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi . and even if the blocking of blogs may not be meaning@@ less for the world , so it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It happened to them to conv@@ ey the feeling of an accus@@ ation ; A arrest , a seek@@ er murder , un@@ loading by the National Security Council , the lock blogs and any other web site for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have shown that I was not in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only one small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to the item to handle c@@ ens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; however , after they have blocked him , and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the mud altern@@ ate the way up to an end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) closed Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this showed technical tests on networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( IS@@ P ) , including orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of providers , by converting internet c@@ ens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 we realized how the blocking of Web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s began . &quot;
&quot; such practices suggests the intention of the government to block content and filter , to access to the Egyptian users . &quot;
&quot; the situation will also be conce@@ aled in addition , that the tick @-@ decisions are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis using them to proceed in court against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants are quar@@ rel@@ ing .

&quot; daily newspaper reports from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city of the country and home of numerous postcard designs in Brazil . &quot;
some of these lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot dead in school , &quot; &quot; every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Die@@ be scre@@ wed pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8500 soldiers of the army , marine and air @-@ air according to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a well @-@ called financial situation , the German force in Rio reached its highest level since 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental Organisation Global Justice even proclaimed the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
&quot; reports like these are everyday and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 , at least the manager of a local newspaper . &quot;
&quot; so published for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16 , the editorial &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; in which they announced , a new section called &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports about violence in the city are now published there .
the moti@@ ves for their decision declared the paper so :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes reported in any major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual ab@@ ort , etc . everything what is happening from the civil standard and what is happening only in Rio , is not normal in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so as journalists don &apos;t close our eyes from the cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video that was dealt on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the Chief Editor of the newspaper that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
&quot; extra is probably the only newspaper in the whole world , with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war . &quot;
&quot; in the same video , a journalist in the newspaper explains that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas , outlines of criminal organizations . &quot;
&quot; in the Editorial , the newspaper writes on : &quot;
&quot; aware that a war exchange rate is aware that if it is dist@@ orted , the police can also be used to extingu@@ ish cru@@ el@@ ly , and then ask questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and their partner . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; do more than it benefit ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The inter@@ c@@ ept Bras@@ il , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira has argu@@ ed that the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in their opinion a justi@@ fication of failed security policy by the media and could make it more difficult , responsible for the police force . &quot;
this is no war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning , as well as extra in the analysis of military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ pleasing negle@@ ct of the public service . &quot;
&quot; commem@@ or@@ ating : the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital , the state of Rio de Janeiro . &quot;

&quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro as a &quot; &quot; most violent place in Brazil &quot; &quot; is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 non@@ violent cities in Brazil lie in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest data available . &quot;
no such cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ates pro state , Rio is ranked 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; one of the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company of South America , emphas@@ ises how Cec@@ í@@ lia emphas@@ ises the state &apos;s security policy since years . &quot;
&quot; the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the Federal Police Unit in 2003 , belonged to the police unit , whose goal is to conquer a F@@ av@@ ela police and a unity permanently . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning it actually led to a decrease of non@@ violent deaths . since some years , the U@@ PP but after several reports about ch@@ ic@@ ans and repression against the poor municipalities which should protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles from the year 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio did not comply with the term &quot; civil war &quot; - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also draws serious consequences for people after themselves . &quot;
&quot; this requires the state to use means and ways that are typical for a war . in this purpose , the entry into the territory of a &quot; enemy &quot; is in which a civilian point is in the countryside and an object for &quot; &quot; coll@@ ater@@ restrial damage &quot; &quot; and &quot; dist@@ orted spher@@ es . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war or her , fact is that the inhabitants of the F@@ av@@ el@@ as continued to suffer in Rio . &quot;
&quot; one week it is now , that the police cl@@ ashed the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to betra@@ y the death of a polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident made headlines : an or@@ chard died as a result of shots , who had fired the police from a helicopter . &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly due to the Assad regime against loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ eir ez and Id@@ lib in a state of siege . &quot;
&quot; particularly strong is the East G@@ hou@@ ta region , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition to assume , based on investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations , that the massacre of Assad has been practic@@ ed by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebels controlled the areas outside Damascus under siege , which led to the inhabitants of local authorities or via tun@@ nels and control points . &quot;
&quot; through the years of block@@ ade , traditional food supplies such as meat have become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ m@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ t@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; food @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ as and perform the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; fung@@ i do not belong to the conventional , planted food in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , they make their nutritional source for many residents of besie@@ ged East G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the right of the project , Maikel Nabil , spoke to the French news agency AFP : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultivation of fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed L@@ eila , one of the organis@@ ers , reported Global Vo@@ ices that had been fighting for three years , this project began to announce that it is now more and more . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative we use in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ as the humanitarian crowd @-@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
&quot; it is planned to conv@@ ey 125 families of knowledge about the pl@@ anting of pilgrims , Dr. L@@ eila to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they will have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12.@@ 700 , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do on Monday , 04 September 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is based on generators , which keep the temperature at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % . &quot;
&quot; because of the fuel scar@@ city , locally manufactured fuel materials are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. L@@ eila told Global Vo@@ ices that she started with the &quot; production of Pil@@ gri@@ eves &quot; , &quot; before they checked their quality , and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when this was done , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; apprenti@@ ce farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
L@@ eila explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; we want to teach human beings from different reasons &quot; : break@@ age of siege .
providing a new source of food on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by eating resi@@ due ( such as paper , tea , coffee machine , cardboard , etc ) for extraction new food . &quot;
&quot; create new jobs , especially for women who work for home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound to their home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea in the whole world , so our success and our fight against hunger and the siege becomes visible . &quot;
we want our experience people in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese challenge righteousness for the victims of 2017
&quot; on 21 October , several hundred people prot@@ ested in many districts of capit@@ als in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that were gr@@ asp@@ ed in the north of Portugal in the week . &quot;
forty @-@ two @-@ two persons died and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week made out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in Gal@@ icia Region of Spain where there were 4 deaths .
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire break@@ through@@ s that spread themselves in northern and central regions of the country , and about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande occurred a similar tragedy in which the fires gave 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European Forest Monitoring System , which monitored the forest area by satellite photos , are burned in Portugal about 500,000 hectares of forest - an area of the size of the district of Lisbon alone . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the Ernst of the location : there is no fire in 4 districts .

the se@@ eable tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the requirement for better preventive and fire @-@ fighting measures by the state .
people asked why the civilian protection was not able to im@@ itate the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
João So@@ ver@@ al from the federal government of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
&quot; this Sunday they did not : there are endless reports of open roads , which were surrounded by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy like in June could happen again , as the streets were very late . &quot;
&quot; in addition , construction permits in Ö@@ r@@ t@@ d will be requested with a high risk of Bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko . &quot;
&quot; a comprehensive proposal to the Wal@@ vis , which the government had brought to severe fires in the years 2003 and 2005 , has been objec@@ tion@@ ed by the Commun@@ e which saw the new rules as obst@@ acle for investment . &quot;
&quot; the government carried out a sum@@ mon@@ ition of the law , which allowed the construction activity case , if the applicant could have an open back@@ door , so that it could be built , &quot; João Sor@@ val continues to be built in the same article in the P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o newspaper . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Quer@@ cus made attention to that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees made of slightly burning wood , as in a v@@ icious circle , as to fires of this type always further . &quot;
&quot; in addition to these problems , the website of the civil protection of Portugal was added to the 15th and 16th of October , when people were looking for information or attempted to contact their relatives . &quot;
&quot; it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they used their own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real @-@ time about the location and the spread of fires . &quot;
&quot; the project was founded in 2015 by the developers João P@@ ina in order to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire brig@@ ade and was decisive in this fat@@ eful weekend in October so that the servers followed the attack of the 400,000 users that followed the fires , the site counted more than half a million . &quot;

&quot; even if his mother didn &apos;t say so then , she knew that she would not see her son very long - maybe even more . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the boy was to break . &quot;
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the lock .

&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan . &quot;
for a few years he worked in a co@@ hes@@ itation . the work was hard and made him sick .
&quot; then he took what was left from his low wages , and went to Iran . once again he was in a strange country together with other refugees and to@@ wed sacks with mort@@ ar that were heavier than he himself , to make his living . &quot;
&quot; at that time , life of Afghan refugees was influenced by mis@@ ery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site , which we also worked . &quot;
there were no services there and no heating . we hanged n@@ ylon in front of the open windows that we don &apos;t tum@@ ours at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous crossing of the sea , he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time had been homeless , left alone by the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that divided twice a day food in needy . &quot;
&quot; indeed , it is true that Italy is a type second chance for previous asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is true , however , that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers are in the country cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
the Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of the asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; special admission centres . &quot; this is an impro@@ mpt@@ u facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ qualified personnel .
&quot; according to the Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to an admission centre if they officially got an application for asylum - which can still be sent for months after registration of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; by then , people who have no money for an accommodation or to sleep either to the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so there was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his in@@ conc@@ ession of life helped A@@ shar@@ af to liber@@ ate himself soon out of these conditions .
&quot; after having made various works in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af set up his entire savings in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot;
so it was so good that he opened a second hostel with a little while after a while .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureau@@ cracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a trans@@ itional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , several of Afgh@@ ans developed companies , including car@@ vings , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Oriental Experience , where the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff are mainly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant is told by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek judgments , the history of their journey to Italy . &quot;
&quot; in Padua , the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a Sushi Restaurant in Rome also are also Afgh@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims to go far beyond the Italian gastronomy trade and retail trade , and aim to go back to the country that he had to leave . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , there are possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
&quot; I never forget my country , and I can &apos;t be happy when I know my people suffer . &quot;
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of the company and must get the same possibilities as everybody else .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also decor@@ ate plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where people can sell packaging and preserv@@ ative techniques . &quot; so they can sell their harvest on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through un@@ certainty and doubts , but at the end there are stability and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af made this journey itself . now , he wants to help others to help others in this way . &quot;
&quot; Ne@@ ti@@ zen Report : coun@@ ties of Egypt allow social networks , Mah@@ moud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , has been detained for more than 900 days . &quot;
&quot; he reported about the evacu@@ ation of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ w@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

&quot; the Egyptian Parliament checks a bill of bill , which fore@@ sees that users can only use social media as Twitter or Facebook only after a registration at a government agency . &quot;
&quot; users had to use to use social networks , in order to be able to use social networks within six months following the subject of its complete name , as well as its ID number . &quot;
those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months in prison or the En@@ tr@@ ation of a criminal payment .
&quot; the law , which was applied by sixty parliamentary members , is currently under the processing and the constitutional Committee of the Parliament , and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , a deputy of Dep@@ uties gave a legislative proposal to be introduced in the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of the President or of the High public officials . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law the ins@@ ult of the pre@@ sidents and public institutions is already pun@@ ish@@ able . under the bill of law a such act would indeed be rever@@ ed , however , with prison and monetary policy , right @-@ wing by Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be passed , it may have been sentenced to three years &apos; imprisonment for the convic@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would have under@@ gone a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of freedom has been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; an distinctive example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ moud , Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) , arrested on 13 August 2013 , when he demonstrated Egyptian police officers to protest against the military coup that led against the military coup that led to the official president Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting , like more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested during the same incident , four years in jail at a court date . &quot;
&quot; recently , on the 20th May , his sentence was postpon@@ ed because of the prison sentence , according to human rights groups , had failed to put the def@@ endants of the prison in the court . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups , p@@ seudo @-@ ownership , illegal assembly , murder , and an attempt to murder . &quot;
in another case a Criminal Court in G@@ iza spoke the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary free . they were charged for their reporting on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
&quot; the court also reduced the stra@@ pping of journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mustafa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested during the preceding incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunis@@ ian activists interro@@ gated by the Tunis@@ ian activists
&quot; in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was interro@@ gated primarily to a continuous action plan . a plan is based on the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , expressly provide a controversial bill , provided by the dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption . &quot;
&quot; on April 21 , on the web site of Na@@ wa@@ at , a document poses a light on how the pre@@ si@@ di@@ al plans look for the support of the legisl@@ ature . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nam@@ ing of his sources under article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press complex that journalists protect the right to protection of their sources .
nevertheless he joined the District Court in Tunis on 09 . may as a witness in the case .
will China force users to force social media to submit their identification ?
&quot; according to new rules of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users need social media in China to write or share news in social media . &quot;
&quot; in the regulations , the registration with the full name will be required . &quot;
&quot; analysts predi@@ ct that by the Eli@@ min@@ ating anonymous comments in entertainment within social networks , it is un@@ clear how the authorities can apply these regulations . &quot;
&quot; Chinese net citizen proposed in social media , these regulations have only sel@@ ective to protect the civil journ@@ alism and its independence . &quot;
see you then in &quot; We@@ chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May the state c@@ ens@@ orship of Russia stopped the access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ chat .
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ chat will register with the state government as an &quot; organizer of the information prolifer@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this term is part of a law from the year 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government leads a list of online services , which allows the &quot; publication of the information &quot; . &quot; the law also allows the government to make responsible for the removal of content and force them on request to termin@@ ate user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites currently include websites like V@@ cont@@ te and Od@@ no@@ gen@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the E @-@ Mail @-@ Service Mail@@ .@@ ru , and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court has Sper@@ di@@ ans Wikipe@@ di@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court had a Turkish court disp@@ osed of blocking di@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administ@@ rators refused to er@@ ase two English articles that support Turkey support the jihadists in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Marine , and Communication had been imprisoned because they joined the information source of information related to groups , in order to tackle a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time that Turkey is blocked off the website . it is thus , in addition to China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain can not stop her@@ al@@ g@@ gling
&quot; after this week , the government of Great Britain is located in the midst of a targeted consultations that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications provider to monitor communications provider in real @-@ time and resol@@ ving the data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has cons@@ ul@@ ted a telecommunic@@ ations company and intelligence services on the proposal , however , has left other technology companies and the civil population . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation runs until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of Interior . &quot;
