<seg id="1">Although I visited the US at least once a year since 2012 I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love of America is extremely great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation, I grew up with American films, I have read American music, read American authors and operated its sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had a very profound effect on me that I was mainly because of a American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura-Student, who had the Supreme Court of Justice to occupy its interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free after technique Man," I was it, as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year that I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only intensified."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country where I ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting you to be that you are always and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equality people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very slim love letter concerning his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is to me as he goes with his narrow-minded man.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in his opinion, he never stops behind the mountain, how to say so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague express it, and openly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroamerican and Women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people have reacted on his testimony, and agreed in droves for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes, which he won by the Republican pre-election, was the highest number formed by the Party of nominated candidate."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this biggiate person I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not get trump and his electorate in harmony with the people whom I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"as for example, my Professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, takes people out of all over the world, a deep believing man, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Trumps, too, did not agree with the present editor of Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met our common love for basketball and we spent a lot of hours with the "Phoenix Suns" to watch the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps intolerance also stands in contrast to generosity, which I experienced in Sandy Bahr, who had her life in the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"still it fits to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and arrogance, and my colleagues helped to accuse us to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose supporters helped me much in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those by they embodied my love in America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"during Trump in his way to the nominated Republican Presidential candidate, she offered me a stop and the counterpart on its limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on November 8, 2016, more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or maybe because of its contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that humans have voted for Trump, because they were either shared on racism and Fanatism, or because they were prepared to overlook these things, almost the heart broke me."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call Trump-voters as raassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to arrange the people, one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficially and respectless and implies an inability to understand those who act on a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about hectic changes in their municipalities can not be considered.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that those voters, of whom are most white, have voted for Trump because they want control over a country that she has disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commenting on the cruel decision to lift up a man who looks down with contempt of those who look differently than he."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(1020 m.: as much as" rejection of white against all other ethnicities "; vocabulary of white in playing on the white and whichash, as it means the big Van Jones, did exactly what America did so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether the myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which belief or background you may have always, America is called every welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as his presidents, twice the son of a Kenyaners, whose history, as he says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the election of Donald Trumps, however, a huge part of the white America's promise is on it and says," "hell with complexity, religious freedom and all the concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in the Americas, after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the rudder, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"at all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, my son, captain Humayun Kahn had a place in your America?" "Mr. Khan asked."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd answered with a loud" "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" he filled the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they called them, and their voices were louder. "</seg>
<seg id="56">"if anyone, who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan decided in words," "thank God, Mr. Trump, is not your America." "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son fell, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"now, this is Trumps Land, said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">"all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could no longer find any place in this new America."</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular with tourists, but worlds apart from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"since a couple of years now, the La Banda de MÃºsica (Musikbande) plays in the congregation: one of children and adults of existing symphony orchestra, which has found their musical instruments an opportunity to overcome the neglected poverty."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students became the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the municipality, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexicos, is known for their drugs abuse and bankers."</seg>

<seg id="80">"they are always laughing and with shining eyes and play in the trusty you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the Conga."</seg>

<seg id="87">"first it was very difficult because we had no space for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place, the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children."</seg>

<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that targeted on international, practiced solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">"as part of an agreement with Global Voices, it will happen in the context of an agreement with Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, this ship was already known that this ship was already operating in the Liberia waters of illegal fishing, before reaching the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">"in this regard, the East African countries were brought up and slightly tilted, the criminals of this species to be welcomed into its coasts."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comorors, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized rapidly against the ship. they refused to give him one of their harbours and refused to give him a fishing permit."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything", "Benedict Kiilu, a senior executive of the Kenyan fishing agency. he is part of a team that discovered the ship and followed."</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it wasn't able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, there was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars on Liberia because of pillaging the country's stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which protects against criminal practices and protects resources, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO stop illegally Fishing (Illegal fishing) was founded."</seg>
<seg id="107">"the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries that had been expelled from their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" thus, we have eight countries that are the same and work together. they exchange information and stand out each other where it's about illegal fishing, "" says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending illegally Fishing. this project offers technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is captured, is hidden, because it is extremely difficult for it. this is illegal fishing a major cause of overfishing regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the deliberate abuse of existing laws, by which specific habitats and species should be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems may harm a delicates equilibrium."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while the action against illegal fishing was once hindered by bureaucratic obstacles and also by the snowshootempo, with the information from individual countries, these actions do not happen in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there you can interfere with each other, for example, lists existing licenses, news to suspicious activities or details that you noticed during a port inspection or experienced."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive, when moving around in the open sea, with satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to identify ships that can fish in forbidden areas. even so suspicious riding routes can be discovered, such that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations can show whether the involved ships have a fishing licence where they were on the way and possibly, whether they have a criminal."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries who are against illegal fishing, can then deny the acceptance of such ships in their ports. what means that the ships can't sell their load in their ports, as in the case of the Prime Minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it's about significant financial losses in the owners, meaning that illegal fishing is financially worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that's what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, senior director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a mountain firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to back up an estimated 20 million USD in lost sales, which lose the eight members of the HISH-i each year due to illegal fishermen, penetrate in East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing trailers around the world and attracts the region's commercial fisheries. this is also the same as illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">"among other things, actions include actions such as sailing under false flag, fake licensing documents, identifying identifying species and fishing in nature areas."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they take advantage of the missing international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-mosquito control system", "says Long." "previously a ship could be illegal and a country could then say 'You must not run my harbour."</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. 'and exactly this legal conclusion tries to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i participated in more than 30 examinations."</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has criminal media uncovered, which had been revealed to fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships which used several fraudulent identities and has found fledging ships."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international agency for combating crimes, FISH-i can share information about illegal fishing over large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organizing crimes "," Bergh says. "</seg>
<seg id="130">"he builds a system that is to help FISH-i, suspicious ships in precise way."</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is always further developed, helps combat the illegal ships to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position. and we are trying to cross-cross, "" says Duncan Copeland, chef analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO which also offers technical support and FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, wherewith they can no longer be operated by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"Copeland helps to build a system that combines different information panels. it should help FISH-i helping to find criminal ships with larger precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations do have influence on the unquestionably global issue of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the Nro SkyTruth, believes this."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed in the world every single traceable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" together with the neighbours, to get a better picture of it, who is doing what makes sense, "" he says. "" here is a chance for countries to unite and bundled their resources for investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this at a global level." "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities do not only feel criminals but they also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships that previously fished without license were confectioned and hardly with consequences, now know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participated in FISH-i participated in a 33% increase in fisheries, since then fishing boats can buy more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia helped, Greko 1 found the inspectors there on board tow nets, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries will also notice that achievement." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we are a study object for several hundred million dollars annually through illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015, six countries have joined together, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. too, they now also fight the illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "with security, the aim is to bring more of such initiatives and structures in other regions," says Copeland. "</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member country could report its first big triumph in Somalia: in October, it represented Greko 1, a ship that was on the way under false flag. and not only the ship was used without license and were used to tow locks that are already banned."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also prohibited in forbidden waters, which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the Take of dimensional rules against Greko 1, it was a strong sign that they walk against illegal fishing." "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence shows that such a special, collaborative occupational effort to protect the oceans actually work throughout the world. Emma Bryce is freelance journalist and lives in London. there she writes about the environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="236">Suddenly he interpreted to an open space and said:</seg>

<seg id="238">"I saw in, and saw a song tortured, tortured and tortured."</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field-bed and metal springs.</seg>

<seg id="248">I knew that these people were killed '</seg>

<seg id="277">I was an officer in the gendarmerie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal it all in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>

<seg id="359">"we are really sorry that older people felt by inadequate correction (the translation) for our part," said the police. "</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News sat down with the phenomenon of the "fearful" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are varied.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to translate, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the text-text and active language knowledge to translate it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active rule of the target language - something that is in case of speakers. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native language."</seg>
<seg id="379">"thus, a French native speakers should translate into French by the German language - not from the French to English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ employees with English as mother tongue that could make translations into English. this may cause lack of understanding for overlaying, cost reasons, or the relatively low number of English speakers who can learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies that have no foreign workers, do not leave translations. then the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is the best to be considered to be translators - no matter how good or bad his language knowledge really are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the promised and rigmatic phrases created by machine translations, show that this technique can still replace a human translators. this applies to some languages especially."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English phrases in Japan, including the enigmatic essay, often used T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistings - not to be read or understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be still acceptable or at least harmless. however, by major companies or from the government which have the funds to ensure higher standards, you can expect more elaborated translations."</seg>
<seg id="389">The town of Kyoto will hopefully use a serious source of translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections have recently agreed to "draft regulations on the usage and usage of social networks."</seg>

<seg id="505">"within six months with acceptance of the law, users had to register their users in the site of the site with their right name and personnel numbers to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"it will fail to do this, so that could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or a cash."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill, consisting of six paragraphs, including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as a" any application that runs over the Internet and will be used to communicate with others by voice, video, and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is passed when it is accepted, as the design cannot be imposed on how Egyptian authorities are supposed to register the user's users and users who are not able to register for the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to guarantee the regulation on stage of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, parliamentary committee and patrons of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered user names and user received a user name and a password to get through the firewall that is blocked by the Firewall."</seg>
<seg id="510">"that could mean that Egypt is planning to build a firewall on national level around Facebook. due to them, it would be necessary to submit information on their identity to access the network."</seg>

<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that as they could control violent physical and private rooms as they could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take it seriously, this means that it will be a powerful surveillance system to support citizens to monitor citizens or not. and that means a mad system to monitor the activities of human beings, and also to bring it a court process."</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>

<seg id="643">"the reduction of the sugar tube industry was an economic necessity: 155 sugar production plants were technically outdated, and hardly competitive for the country."</seg>

<seg id="645">They only left the factories left to produce sugar for 4 Centavos (0.03 euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar plantations and the sovereign debt on the global market.</seg>

<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year-old Cousin thinks that he is great. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the" heroic parents "of the offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, it is that, as if they derives those who have lost someone, and those who have fear that they had something like that."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories are too blown numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the crime of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbor should be justified, that they were" dead. ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they try to agree that they are spared from such tragedies, if they do not stir and still remain silent."</seg>

<seg id="1136">"can there be an option, here and now despite a language barrier with someone in touch with someone?"</seg>
<seg id="1137">"for Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the stories of stories in their original language is a possible response."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"global Voices reported recently about a different initiative by Steven Bird, the Untranslated blog."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"however, here is the focus of TLS not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to obtain the language diversity of great cities and to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"in fact, urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS already has been carried out since 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages will not be given to the children born there."</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of this project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">"the mass mortality of the world can be avoided if we accept cities, accept diversity - safe rooms, in which inhabitants don't have to be forgotten, who they are to belong to."</seg>
<seg id="1143">"while listening is often associated with it, to understand" purposes these events instead "hear, to appreciate, to make use."</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, storytellers put their story initially in their own language and translate, or explain it in English."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"if the participants don't have professional storytellers, their devotion and their representation is that the listeners were leaving."</seg>
<seg id="1146">"they call laughter and emotions, when the language is no longer a barrier."</seg>
<seg id="1147">"the following video shows a traditional history from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller raassidatou contests take the opportunity to explain the narrative art of narrative art."</seg>

<seg id="1255">"Mosambians reacted with anger on a corruption case, in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus, where corruption was committed."</seg>

<seg id="1257">"the money came from public funds from Mozambique, whose Council Cambaza was appointed between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 because of a good lead and immediately requested his re-setup into the company, which took place on April 19 then."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with an opinion of the General Prosecution of the Republic, which granted the application for Cambaza, there would be no barrier to refer back to his old post, since the company was not able to deal with the company."</seg>

<seg id="1261">"the centre for public integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, short CIP), a local institution which asserted for public transparency, condemned the company's decision to address the director."</seg>
<seg id="1262">"represents a setback in the fight against corruption, and clearly indicates the lack of transparency and even a regression with regard to the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we have to know is that the company should have to lead a disciplined procedure against the contradictions.</seg>

<seg id="1273">"Cambaza is missing the morality to return to the state, * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but has only served himself on the state instead."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza was used by the state, as a handler to become an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself is weary of this man, and finally sentenced to a long term imprisonment."</seg>

<seg id="1288">"photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the known Social Network received its posts from the net because they played the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"even though the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to assign to people of East Indian origin or as an adjectively" Indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook is censored the word" Kalar "or of the" "Kalar" "(in burial lettering) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radically nationalistic movements has given the word an extremely abdicated connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that mostly be used by Ultra nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar 'may normally be brought together with racism in connection, but the word itself is calling out to hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that, in which they have discussed the use of the word, or doubt the use of his use, were censored."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"moreover, there are several burial words with basic different meanings that have the same letter steps as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, the chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing' which contains the same letters, as well as other words such as' Kalar pae '(camel) or' kalarkaar '(curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookuser Aung Kaung Myat explained the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends on the spiritually kind, whether they might know how he could relieve his back pain by doing a word."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the sentence ku la -" "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different. "</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet is the opinion that they will reduce hate speech of a radical nationalists, but also emphasized that Facebook needs to be analytical, before it all the posts that are suspected to spread racism in the suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It will filter the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automation will not understand what you write to Facenook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what is supposed to do instead, is to analyze the post carefully and check it by using the following words."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example," Kalar Htine "(chair) and" Kalar pairs "(spelling verses)."</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the best is that these three nationalists, that hate speech, received a pretty good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action will send a strong signal to all, hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy can't stop long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and Wechat have demonstrated that the censorship of percussions often be a catastrophic and mouse game, whereby the users will simply start to use social networks to express a new word or an alternative writing of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to erase his posts when he just wanted to tell his friends, that the word 'Kalar' is banished by the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">... "when I was attentively attentive to this new directive of Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is closed."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my mail from Facebook was removed and I was forbidden to accept items and parts of content for 24 hours because the post" "Facebook community standards did not answer." "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions on hate speech radically nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, who has nothing to do with hate speech:"</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author divided his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious Fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook might have a welfare intent to reduce racism in Burma by their platform but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"such words, however, will bring out more hatred within the different communities."</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it appears as if they have begun without local context or technical support, and as words like" "chair" "or" "Erbcurry" "have been prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out, they did not have mistakes, they tried not to correct the adulteries."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they only have more respect for the 15 million benefits, which had a big turnover, it would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship is suckled among users for a lot.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now have fun and write about the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate speech to see whether their posts are taken from the net."</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, women avoid women with greatest care, names of husbands, or even of older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead you use a pronouns or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect her husband due to social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences, they should misuse the norm."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto was sentenced from the Indian state of Orela by a criminal court and violated her family and the village community after having addressed a married relatives with their names."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of their wives also does not call on behalf of name, is also common among men. however, they do not fear far less assignments if they do not come after this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"nine women, among them health staff and housewives, were a unique club in the small village Walhe in Pune, a unique club and became the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">"it is a place only for them alone, where they discuss the enemy of the Patriarchats and discuss."</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and establishes itself for the dismantling of the Patriarchats."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Paola has been working for seven years with the help of their video camera to the discovery of internships, such as children's heating up to the ban of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and leads this clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">"it reports about how this club created a safe place for these women, and at the same time they have made it at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini in her discussion round, acted by women who did not call her husbands at the name."</seg>
<seg id="1482">"she decided on this topic, because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem which can easily identify the women."</seg>
<seg id="1483">"don't hesitate to pronounce the name of their husbands, is a brilliance that they may apply all indecent and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition means that a woman disrespectful her husband and wishes him long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who does not keep this, is considered a hindess, as a woman without morality."</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband, who had never seen her husband to try out at home, as it is running."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband still silent for a long time after the video was ended.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should call him out of his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in Bagini started her first discussion lub.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" Patriarchate "never before. some believed that there was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women were protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to bring discussion with a practice in motion."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked any participant in to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, annoyed, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked them all," If we can't say the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want us to respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when she brought the name of her husbands on her lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village Walhe in Maharashtra over the break of a centuries-old tradition, in which women never married the names of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy, that during the whole practice there was only in front of oneself; another decided to release the whole frustration against him and his family, having cursed him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"in fact, in the Adrenalinrink, in addition to an ancient fires, the women decided that they would really try to call their husbands at the name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the coming days, Rohini received a multitude of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she sat in the head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it in dinner from the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"her mother-in-law she was afraid, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini said I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understandable and the situation artete in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reported how women tried to stop other practices, such as the carcinoma of the red dot on the forehead, which shows the marriage status:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would bear the interest of the red dot, if he would like it."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I listened to him to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women didn't go completely with it, but they mean that they are now in a better position to choose it in some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion lub is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make a trip at any discussion lub.</seg>
<seg id="1520">"normally, we take lunch and water and go out into the field."</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want to worry about the women who could hear," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"in the last months, they celebrated their own birthday with cakes for the first time in their lives, they sang and sang about things about which they never had thought before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have also made some things, for example, like our identities in our husbands, never been so honest."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to say some things loud, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talk about the concept of honour and as it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have carried out saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"most of them is the okay, but some wanted a Salman-Kurta, a wide shirt over a trousers; they have not dared."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much argument and discussion about the advantages of their own coat-choice, morals linked with the Saris and much more, dirty Rohini her own couple Kurtas (Oberhemden) in a discussion round, so the women could carry them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they now decided to plan an excursion to Goa in which they can carry Jeans and Rohini is certain that they will create it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"to the question, whether in the five months have already changed a little bit, Rohini confirms that things get slowly into rolling:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have made little steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then stopped to say the name of their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some of me included, do it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two will still say the names of their husbands; only one or two women carry on each time Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in discussion lub know that the changes that they would like to reach them in their lives - like the bracing of more freedom of movement or your own coat-choice - at the end of a hard to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by turning each other self-confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How to explain Rohini:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchats.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club is each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction if every woman is in the club home, and other people reported what we are talking about what we do."</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam should be considered as a town in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This observation has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the conference on the occasion of a meeting at the international branch of the Bar Association of New York, the Minister said that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore as they compare Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">Nobody asked whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">"this is, most people have a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accuses the Minister of Justice to turn the logic of logic in order to defend the existing authoritarian Aid of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and promotions to create this valuable country, you can say that we finally don't have any country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had an escape from the responsibilities, a mandatory injury."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons of Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could measure the political system of Singapore not with other 'normal countries', in view of his, he appeared unrefused."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"by contrast, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that become permanent from a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"once you reach the theme of the subject, the good old bodies of the feasible power emerges once again, leaving Democrat democrats, leaving the twisted logic, because it fits better to its power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"the final week of Shanmugam was given answers to its American guests regarding our press, our Judikative, our political system truly non-answers."</seg>
<seg id="1703">Relevant questions tarts with non-answers rational species.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to illustrate his opinion because she didn't understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city is, so in which country belongs to our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very thankful if our werter K Shanmugam would take up the effort to clarify this point if he was paid high, to be part of the City of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"as Anon published his comment on the blog, it indicates that you should start to read the full address of the conference, in order to understand the context of the declaration of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and no country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the postal address.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"as he said that Singapore is rather a" city "be considered a country," said he, why the elections in Singapore are so important, even if we are looking for free and appropriate elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He was able to win Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"he said that Singapore" is not a country, "he has not meant it in that sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment of Shanmugam as leader of a growing generation that makes such polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am talking about what the Minister of Justice in Singapore has said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew about Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde, which is expecting me - whether I agree with them or not, but that's a different thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the Singapore leader of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not sure if he really believes it is true and aware of what he defended."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review Shares the vulnerabilities of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr Shanmugam have committed a mistake or was it a freer speaker?</seg>

<seg id="1721">"if not, on which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique. it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"as he plays an important role within the government's government, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam is important."</seg>

<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink number?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"as a Decade, the magazine Journey of a Decade is declared that Singapore is always a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I did not say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed a lot of Singapur...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements such as" the defense of the country especially ", etc., but that's not quite true."</seg>

<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants attempting to cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula. it is located at the border with Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is directed by a 59- year-old Mexican, a small woman with a coral pink Brillenbase and gold colored earrings in teddy bear shape."</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. yet they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather they themselves) became a target for Africans and Haitians who are on the transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel does not have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2,50 Dollar per night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with polls, crumbled walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - but hundreds of African and haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes Mrs RamÃ­rez, the people in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call:" Mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at present it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms. some have already slept outside on cardboard.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She wants to reject anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them, and brings them to the hospital if they are sick, they buy them medication that they cannot pay, they massage them with a balm that exhausts from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived recently."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if mom is a reasonable nickname for Mrs RamÃ­rez.</seg>

<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I really feel that it suits her, since African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the cordiality of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">"Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to get to Boston to relocate her husband and her three children."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans, who are on the way to the United States, normally make a first stop in South America and then take the direction north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had owned by other signs of Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a well-known name on the route, "says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">"he tells that the Haitians and Africans often travel together, and that, Africans already speak to WhatsApp by Mrs RamÃ­rez."</seg>
<seg id="1927">"as many of its guide, Michelet has lived in Brazil in advance, and worked as a building worker at building sites of the Olympic Games and the soccer World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when Brazilian economy weakens the economy, he began its journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">"for months of guest he is a guest for Mama Africa: it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money, to buy the Bustuet to Tijuana."</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he is in the future with Mrs. RamÃ­rez's future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again," he answers smiling. "we will always remain in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">"Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells us that their guests often send text messages when they went, to grate them or to report about the course of their journey."</seg>
<seg id="1933">It explains that their Christian faith is the drive of its work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but their guests have taught her, chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Mrs. RamÃ­rez, perhaps known here is very known, but it is not the only spark for migrants traveling through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the city, a snogasse leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"in this winter, Valenzuela and his family have recorded migrants in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is Policist and found that the busses will be sold to numerous African migrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he started to help them a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking area outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he tells. "I experienced what it will experience."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's the reason why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived for three years, he was referred to a raid on his desktop from the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants traveling through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents can open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">"JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he had fled with his wife and his three children in front of the people who wanted from him money, without having a plan."</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, an omnipresent, gave him her roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family lives and is still trying to decide where the next steps should go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the gears, the travellers are quietly under telephones."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a small bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother dazzle her in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hairstyles that you have made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and elderly."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughed sad while she presides for me.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"a check-Point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users, with additional structure of two,"</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, a ethnic minority region in China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the mobile users received a mobile phone notification in the Tianshan district of Urumqi, in which it indicates the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or" Web Cleaning ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the message, the app is said that the app is to obtain access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities use the app for more than the combating terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh Women were arrested in autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because they had installed the app to be exchanged with a private Wechat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"in the notification of the police, the app will determine the sources and the circulation routes of the terrorists, together with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, images, ebooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">"Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is blocking pornographic web pages, from online scam, Trojan and Phishing pages to make users attentive how much time they spend online, and to control the own home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minors will help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can be used in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "state" or even hacker could enable the home network of a person to manipulate or steal it. "</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while messages about digital censorship in China usually focused on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often gloom for those who live in distant ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"in order to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme interest and monitoring measures, as well as routinous Internet shutters."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the latest news from Mainland China" "images from Mainland China" "(on the top of the top of the airline China), the censored news in China, showed photos from a checkpoint where police officers indiscriminately checked the residents, whether they had the surveillance app installed."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that the people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are discovered at a checpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for the technological development.</seg>

<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council Council to minimize the distribution of illegal content.</seg>

<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib catch a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib brings most of his time inside; sometimes he smelled to his canvas, sometimes to his computer, and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is a cigar between his fingers or his with nicotine defiled lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives in the top of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year, in which Israel ended up his occupation of the West Bank and had been forced to escape from their village in Palestine, where they had lived as fellowlands (about: farmers)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist, who has surrendered to the conservative majority, and complained about gender roles, sexuality and free expression on gender roles, sexuality and free expression."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music that often deals with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian antagonists, but also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics cannot only be found in his hometown Amman relevance, but also in cities that from Damascus in Syria to the whole of Sanaa."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"at the age of 25, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by limits and can help people with the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not exist openly, he performs a special abortion against US foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion on those who are trying to do in war zones, something to do with his identity as" Palestinian gefledged of the second generation - so he himself describes himself, even though he was born in Palestine. "</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own life circumstances so," stresses Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I'm a man, "while he cunsoldered in water. it is the holy month of Ramadan; it is the holy month of Ramadan; in that time it is intended for Muslims to fasten sunrise at sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for this to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee went little to protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the slaughter speak tepid coffee and the vault of the Kent cigarette in the nose very first of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky, especially when you throw a look into neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it just avoids to do fundamental things - as in the public during Ramadan water - to land not in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Interior Ministry announced its appearance of the band Mashrou 'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentary elections that support the Islamic State Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual Frontiers Hamed Sinno speaks to the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert chart.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former press briefing of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert had been cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the Sickers.</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which represents the old-proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou 'Leila valued the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights "which continued to be decided on an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement is probably not just the rhetoric of rhetoric, but indeed a clear, crystalline reality in Jordan was clearly reflected in Hdaibs's work clearly."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib traditional gender norms came into body by forming his vision of the fate of Arabic women who have voiced sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an obvious unknown woman, whose arms and legs are up to the corners of the screen."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of them that they should trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in the past years, Jordan has increased the number of 'honorary mornings' - the unofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"human Rights Watch according to Human Rights Watch reached its high point in 2016; however, it is still important that Jordan has become institutional infrastructure to support women who tried victims of murder or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law for breaking control of the year 1954, women who are subjected to the danger of a family of familial violence," and for their release often a few long bureaucratic expenses, as well as the guarantee on the family is necessary that the woman is not going to happen. "</seg>
<seg id="2122">"also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well known for that, not to rejuvenate topics in its country long as tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is politically, is a dream that he is his music, which is full of explicit acts based on sexuality, freedom and opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the seost, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"politics was singeted to me," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question about the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lavla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" is the focus on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs, which are politically inpolitical, can be continued."</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song with the title of "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"in this song, one verse is repeated often:"</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the course of the songs, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, in which one can get what you want" "be faith or non-faith, heterogeneity or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that anyone speaks in Jordan on the rights of gay and lesbian and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still heavily censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian Onlineprogram Roya to notice that his comments were torn from the context, twisted and censored in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without incisions. but there was only a working version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib advertises the Arabic LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance did not disagree to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nua, a poet from the eighth century, which still remains in memory thanks to its homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks: when Abu Nudas, who should work later on behalf of the caliph, could be writing openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians do that?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, did nothing with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the anti-Semitic kingdom, there is nothing new that the government warts attacks on free expression of expression and that progressive vote will be put to silence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service appointed several former government officials and members of the teaching associations, with the grounds that they had agreed on commentaries in social media critically related to the problems with which deeply rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of what is the concert of Hdaibs, only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to work a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress is a decent gossip and take off. Jordan has lasted for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - it looks down from slow, thoughtful and inner changes. it is sure that these changes run from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs also dreams, from an Arab world without interventions abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dreams of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region can be governed by music, art and literature in real and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, scattering and to artificial nature. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until far, Hdaib will continue to continue, and thus also resistance will afford."</seg>

<seg id="2150">"these large, extravagant wardolls are so fantastic!!!"</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta Festivals.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one is presumed that there is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus took place and out of a period of time, in the armies of Japan invaded the northeast of Japan in order to force the indigenous population of the region, the Emishi, into the knee."</seg>

<seg id="2156">"a community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition at Wa no Akari (literal)."</seg>
<seg id="2157">I've been looking back to the Meguro Gajoen for long time: two fixed cars are straight to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta festival is the only true - and to spend an amazing way to spend his summer:"</seg>

<seg id="2168">"El Callao, Perus most important harbor, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic centre of Lima's capital of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate where roads and illegal drug trafficking are daily."</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru - like many other middle and South American countries - rising demand for aesthetic services to men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsers such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallesis (Peru), and Neymar (Brazil), has led to the more normal hands of hairdressers to make these elaborate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event dedicated to the competition of hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been taking place since 2014."</seg>

<seg id="2181">"the following article is the working version of the Beitrags" Liebeskind to guerrilla fighters, who published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve. "</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here within a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"isn't it a lot more importantly, people who are outcast out in future?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this question went on the two young Colombian activists Leonardo PÃ¡rraga by the Young Youth Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to write the campaign cartas por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation), which encourages young people to write guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"recently, her country was the place of an historical event and they wanted to help her part: after years of negotiations the Colombian government had closed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was considered as significant that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for its services to the Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>
<seg id="2188">"still a long way ahead of Colombia, Colombia is still a long way to talk about real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"Guerrilla fighters who have lived for many years in illegal camps, were exposed to a rhetoric and around the clock in their arms they have to reintegrate itself into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society again, which had used to life in constant fear and in some cases, has to record profound hatred toward guerrilla fighters, they now have to support them in their ranks and support them in the building of a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombia shall join together and help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And exactly that they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - lovers of former guerrilla fighters to welcome them again in the company.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The campaign's goal is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighters that will be personally handed over.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for reconciliation originated at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Laureate, who took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there they had Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to speak short with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we love the people who love to write to thousands of love letters, but those who forget it will need a lot."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plan, he told us to share his love with people who needed the most urgent feedback."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"thus, the plan, letters of hope and support for former militants of the FARC, which now has to create their place in society and to create a new life." "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make discourse of a war history to a common history of peace." ""</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities throughout Colombia as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I would never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation Bogotart traveled to the camp to personally revive the letters."</seg>
<seg id="2204">"the members of the FARC set up, as they had done earlier to oppose the commands of their leaders."</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no commands, but letters of underwear from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for all those involved." it's unbelievable how many different feelings can run in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between, telling the political scientist of Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila. "</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, an employee of the governor of the Valle del Cauca Province described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we had handed over the letters, a former fighter led me by the guerrilla fighters camp."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of hut, in which the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla fighters who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down, because beside him on the bed was a MGL-pomegranate, a deadly weapon in Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"and I asked him," "Hello what are they doing?" he said, "I reply to a letter that somebody wrote to me." "</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life someone has something so nice to me. that's why I answer it. suddenly the tears ran on the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">"I embraced him completely, and set me beside the pomegranate."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry for the war, was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions of this kiss, and wanted to help him to write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had anything else from life than war. the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of the Hungertod. "I would never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now, I know that there is a society out there, waiting for us with open arms."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I have only learned how I must deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace is rule, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"to the start, students and some leaders of the FARC came together with a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC already invaded the secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leader of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insights into their views about the peace process:" many years we have experienced how we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help to create the society in this country more fair. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a target of this magnitude, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," said one of them. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"those people hear that so far had never been heard and had no electoral law, and to recognize that the people who I often had seen as monster and even hate them, even people with beautiful emotions, who were turned around by their life and the environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality, in which the country is living, hurting to me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all men - even those who have caused and caused much harm to us, can give us a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have answered the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the archbishop of the city Cali, following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">"the Colombian has been made, that after deforestation peace would reign."</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will be always people who are ready to engage in arms and protest to their rights. this is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we are putting out by the FARC now on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter what breed, religion or ideology they hear - will dreaming of all those who dream of a country in the war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and sacrifice, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence, many difficulties are imminent."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but we will overcome them together."</seg>

<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived at and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a strange woman.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" you don't think about, you heat in safety, just because you have left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">People already know in which hotel you pass. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we don't talk about gender equality, however, this is a tabulated."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally Caucasian elements I still bear in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish it, these seelic barrier can't overcome."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to do them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I actually give myself hard to look like the person who remembers them from their past - so to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends do, those who have stayed?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I filed a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">"for this, I needed more information about the situation in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who had one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that Ramadan had not been arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of the Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and family.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"so I mean, they probably invite the relatives, these care about the problem with the affected person and at the end demand a proof that the so-called" honour "has experienced by blood genugging."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: will there be gay men in these secret prisons too?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there would be not many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, especially those who have no rich relatives, or those of their relatives have been forced to place the Kadyrows court."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they will be held there, that one can present them as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: should they be killed, they will show their bodies in television and claim that they would have attacked any village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply disappeared, but specifically dipped to radicalize itself."</seg>
<seg id="2336">"OC Media: is this only a assumption, or have you a source for this information?"</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I've just had someone who was imprisoned in a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">"he says that many people had disappeared in this prison, after their beard had grown."</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have taken them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord; this person was taken with himself when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">"however, until now they were not introduced as bandits, there were still no experiences yet. we suspect that such actions are possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would I not have allowed this people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who have a so-called" non-traditional "orientation, have already been visited in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">"in Chechnya, I had a Bob."</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think, already in 2003 I was already known in the whole Great, when I lived there - and I never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"from 1998 to 1999, when the Scharia was considered, I never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia wanted to lead us originally to the" civilizing, "but ultimately thrown us back to the stone time."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: what is it possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were hatched; I had coloured eyelashes, wore RÃ¶hrenjeans and short Tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Security Office of Sharia never has a hair curved for me.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theatre in Grozny there was a place where every night, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew it, and knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never insulting.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a promise: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "mock is not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"it is often said to children, when they are fun on sick."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they simply have their eyes closed before you, because they believed, they are sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never offended me, never hunted and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did these gifts begin?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began talking about morality in television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he was not talking about us, but predictated about the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel like people in the city began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who had ridiculed and laughed, looked at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">During the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the republic was constantly tightened."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA are not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still working as activist activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I testimonians with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we perfectly organize teacffs, pasting together, I join them to hospital and help them to get food cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no penny for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered this people himself when I clutate random variety.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that is allied.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so, nature, that has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens I want to do with foam in front of the mouth that there are no flaps in them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestan have those who have the Cabardiner, who have the Russians also have what; on the whole planet it is - but not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, therefore it is unpleasant to hear what to hear."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practising Muslims who go to the mosque and fasten in the Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"do you know, many think about transidy of men who love males, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that is a trusteer."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different types of sensations to be precise, different living settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">"for me, it is most important to feel me in my own skin and not be ashamed for my body."</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"I'm sorry that I will be so personal, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I myself am myself.</seg>

<seg id="2404">"some people made it fast to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought into the valley of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the combuations were so strong that doctors could not do any more."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide who invented themselves in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists warned that more men could take life."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that some other - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - executed this month."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have a thing in common: they were all family members who felt helpless and incapable due to their persecution on the Iranian government, helpless and unable to pursue their families."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region, which is a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community based in Iran, was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard to deny its living."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"before a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was an especially autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took power over and 1925 major efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest in Iran present in-coming oil and gas fields, as well as some of the most important and most valuable resources for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite this valuable resources, the regional economy is still developing only slowly, and the indigenous population gets little from this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and waste."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"in the Iranian regime, Ahwazi Arabs have systematically denied jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industry."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government also built a variety of dams, the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian Areas, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"these demme have led only to destroy the region due to dryness caused devastation, and local agriculture as well as fish and palms industries."</seg>

<seg id="2423">"Dohimi said, that especially the unemployment has become worse and worse. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of Ahwaz emerging ethnic Persian and an anti-Arab discrimination in the creation process:"</seg>
<seg id="2424">"since officials and institutions prefers a non-Arab labour force, the local Arab Ahwazi will have access to working possibilities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is a part of a systematic politics of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs, and to earn their lives outside of their home Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their preferences and surnames to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi, as even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace, because the speaking of Arab language or the dreams of Arab clothes are not tolerated."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the given circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi suffer, hitting human rights activists, before the situation is explosive."</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I do not identified myself with feminism, also with the intersectional"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photos. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the AfrfÃ©minas website. the article was an object of several discussions in which many different positions arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am no feminist, many women - in particular white women, signify themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">You wonder why I'm not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even thought well-thought scientific and social arguments from me why I should be a feminist and why we should be able to be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women still earn less money in spite of equal education than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">"women are still under stringent observation, when it comes to what they are allowed to do with her body."</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms are still ensuring that women sooner or later in various fields of life on a glass ceiling, and that discrimination based on the sex is still across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I am double and threefold.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"nevertheless: when I come to my skin color, on the black Cis women, on black Cis women, on black Cis women, on black women in the LGBTIQ-community or on black women, on which kind we have been physically misused, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists left and white intersectional feminists."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"but nevertheless, they all agree that women - all women - should come together to sing" their voices, and 'Kumbaya, my lord' to sing, to achieve equality (some) of women. "</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they don't want to talk about that, in addition to sexualised violence, there is a institutional form of racist violence that we are exposed to black women on two times."</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or above that black women and women of other ethnicities and arrivals are less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to as white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spouses and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk, domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the other hand, I want all women, all males, and all men who have the same rights; on the other hand, I can't connect the same rights as black as the white woman who refuses to take care of the skin as well as to the skin color of one person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">"I am exhausted and won't fight for my belonging to a white-feminist-oriented sphere, which always turned me and countless other black women."</seg>
<seg id="2455">"when Sojourner accused 1851 in her speech," "am I not a woman?" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a horrified and margable being."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join the groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs, to absorb their egoeccentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to settle white women the importance of overlapping of skin color and gender. for some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to revive them."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional feminism was founded to be a home to women of different interest and to marginalize itself from white feminism, the word" Feminism "is still in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release myself full and completely from feminism and to connect the movement of the Womanism, which was to use me for my dark skin and my status as a woman who is so stubbornly, that interfered as a novel phenomenon is celebrated."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"it is more important than ever before that we define black women to our own ideas, and we will go to the spouses that are created from us for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: Reclaiming Ourselves (about: Africa-Womanism) tells us that we can defend ourselves by our own way, in which they can be completely safe in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be admired."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists immediately invoiced separatiism and exclusion after they read these lines, I pray you about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">"due to my dark skin, I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm as a part of my paradigm."</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment in which my life wasn't persuaded, nor is rejected."</seg>
<seg id="2466">"Paddelet against pollution: a man's mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations,"</seg>
<seg id="2467">"Todd Reubold, this post was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine that reported in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="2468">"as part of a content sharing agreement, this article will be published here again."</seg>
<seg id="2469">"Maikel Nabil Musa traveled over the past 7 years - mostly with surf board or in canoe - with a particular concern through the Kurdistan region in Iraq. his mission aims to make people aware of clean waters to present and future generations."</seg>
<seg id="2470">"in this documentary by Emily Kinskey, we follow Musa who declares us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the effect of pollution in its congregation."</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I definitely want to do something for the river we lost when I was a child," "Musa tells."</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development, will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the non-governmental organization Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterartender Alliance - which aims to protect the rivers, streams, and water paths in Iraq, as well as local municipalities in the sustainable use of this natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video, Musa summarises the stinginess and importance of his work in a question:" if we don't have water more, how would we survive then? "</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was filmed and edited for Ensia von Emily Kinskey, one in Erbil, in Iraq and a multimedia journalist."</seg>
<seg id="2476">"the emphasis on their work is followed, little remarkable subcultures and is characterised by using cooperatively video photography and new multi-media techniques that can tell their help with their help to tell their stories in their way."</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and working version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" of curturally. the article belongs to the series # Porserjer (# variance women) which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police Commissioner said Ada BÃ¡ez, that she had nothing against Luis Balbuena, her spouse who had become violent to violent."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of its relationship, a little time has passed and the police said, their statement would be put to the acts, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"as another wife Balbuena showed, because of abuses, also the aktenant display of Ada BÃ¡ez did not use anything."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second wife moved back to her ad."</seg>
<seg id="2486">To break the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"when women do not want to display at all, they do not receive support from the State."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence at all at the prosecution enforcement agencies."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"input 1 strokes and Statistic 2 Unseen abuses and a legal system, which nothing prohibited under 3 of the laws: good approach, lacking implementation of strokes and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is hard to determine how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, a social research institution in Paraguay." there are various information and reports that show the magnitude of gender violence against women in Paraguay, "she explains."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"the numbers, however, are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, according to the Office of the Public Prosecutor, 9600 ads were charged with domestic violence. 70% of them went to violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of advertisements during the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5,000 ads because of domestic violence in the peace of peace. 86% of the messages came from women."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the indications, 40% of the women were physically remistreated, 55% of the women spoke of psychotic abuses."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics show not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the paraguayan Women's Minister Ana Baiardi indeed, only few of these crimes are actually displayed." "every woman who is reimbursed in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"there are two women who do not do this because of physical abuse, two women who do not do this," "she stated at the end of 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's murder in Paraguay was not a separate crime, the prosecution authorities could not be adequately documented, as many women will be murdered every year from their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"until August 2016, journalists included at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">"the Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases, in which women were murdered by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, in Paraguay all ten days a woman died due to violence by men."</seg>

<seg id="2505">"before Mariana BrÃ­tez became the strong friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the name of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"at the beginning, she didn't want to do it, but then. this should always regret it."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today, Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but for two years, she bore the psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognizable by the most severe:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would have been a victim of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that this only happens to undertake women because they are deceive from violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana uses social media to report about the abuse through Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without name, they wrote contributions to Facebook, in which they described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship, and told how he was isolated."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos itself. he asked rhetorical if he ever collected the hand against them and refused to prove that his behavior was also a form of abuses."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"other Facebook users were asked to Mariana, why they did so long by Carlos, and left him not earlier."</seg>
<seg id="2515">"it seemed almost like, as they wanted to say that victims of abuses were at least a certain complicity."</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was mistreated."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo-CREO network ("I believe you") that consists of women all in any way victims of abuses.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can speak with others about their experiences, listening to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the declarations of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything began with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">"ultimately, her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worthless."</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"in the authorities, Victorias ads stayed with the authorities without a result and even from their relatives, she received no support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"she led a process against her former partner who developed to an unmistakable jurist struggle between Paraguay and her home country, where it was mainly about money, power and influence of their former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">"the laws: good approach, defective implementation"</seg>
<seg id="2526">"there are many laws in Paraguay, which are very good but not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the advertisement of abuses is a way of residues and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," says Victoria Santos. "</seg>

<seg id="2589">"there are two reasons for the demand on site, there are two reasons: for a missing in the offer of the global healthcare industry, many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have in the poorest countries of Africa far more serious effects than elsewhere, and lack of investments in the exploration of these diseases by pharmaceutical companies are a big problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"secondly, research, which is carried out by African scientists himself will be involved in the building of its own research capacities in Africa. a major role in science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent."</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change the global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"Rachel Cernansky's contribution was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been bred in the United States since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 flavours, such as outbreaks, the first plant grown by NASA astronauts in space and has been devoured."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was made only by his own infestyons and the question how many salts of salads can be set to borders."</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s he noticed that more salads were patented and that he could not use it further to breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"patents are not only for individual varieties, but also for specific characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or green leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more of these patents have been registered for ever more plants such as grain or cartridges. based on this trends, plant breeders, environmental protection and non-expert food safety provide for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still breed lettuce, however he needs longer, because his work is always worth more and more limitations."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, as would lie in a river a rock brokes, to whom I have to pump."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that now, but it's a break with breeding tradition," he says. "I think these patents will go on salads."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and when they stand before the court, nobody can breed any more of a new salatvariety, because all the features are already patented. he makes it as good as possible and tries to breed those characteristics that he wants."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and endeavour to use any material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">"in addition, he joined a movement that is getting bigger in the United States and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding (" Open Source "breeding)."</seg>

<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like it would come from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "Open Source" seed) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software to make alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was founded in order to ensure that some plant species and gene are not protected as intellectual property, and so for plant breeders is permanent."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, just called Ossi, U.S. rebreeders may undertake that others may be able to use the seeds of them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to make business with their seed and sell it." open source "breeders allow only others to breed their seed, and it will not be readily available - two aspects that are banned by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for emeritus professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg are control of the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to him, seed plays an important role in larger merge, such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to avoid the latter not or not only little by spreading seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open-source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture, or not." "who's good, locally sourced and sustainable producing vegetables should also know that the way around farmers should also be cultivated in August or September 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"clean-sovereign, without seed, is not possible."</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative also undertake to make other seed remains freely available. in contrast, their advantages in contrast to plant seed and plant characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argued that the future of food supplies is at risk as the available Genpool due to the increasingly numerous spiritual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always available unlimited."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, the Ossi's Director of Ossi, has found himself in her thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all card features are protected as intellectual property, which is either not or less usable for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants, there are such estimates not yet, but experts like Luby suspect that massaging plants as wheat in even greater style are patented than salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question Of Visitors</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are so farmed that they have targeted features - from such, through which their taste or their color improves up to such, due to them in certain environments, and threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents at plant characteristics indicate that the available plant material for breeders is steadily decreasing by more patents. however, genetic diversity is currently unnecessary as ever since the changing conditions caused much worse than the climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an email address, Monsanto-spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledge that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsantos's activities. with a total of four Genks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture, the United States changed the company for the preservation of genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, they contradict that intellectual property has other breeders including" patents and the protection of plant diversity innovations "." a patent is basically taken a plan that everyone can follow soon as the patent has expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">"often, these instructions also help others to come with another method for the same result."</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection is not inhibited to innovation, but promotes them to be provided with the public more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton looks different: 20 years to wait, until a patent pending, it is certainly no innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait for so long to breed in plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have lost the fight."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main argument for Morton is, however, that genetic resources always have been a general thing and continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"that is what inspired us, and it is impossible to use us if we do not continue to use the best and newest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton is disturbed on the concept of experimenting the plant characteristics:" we do not really create the characteristics. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants originate themselves from and as breeders, we have no idea how the plants do that."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the U.S. state of Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" who is a variety that chastens his own values in them. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"who believes on industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, who are needed to grow up Herbiocides in which the cultivation of this concept is cultivated in agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is accurate. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized businesses (such that move on international markets, but smaller than for Monsanto are) patents, it will create most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either to reject it or keep it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding, or both are the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton looks at Salate in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the view that breeders by avoidance of vegetable patrons:" it looks like I'm making new effort to produce new, stronger than the company. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I do constantly need new material for my catalogue, since I know my competitors can sell my varieties in a few years ago," he says. "" with a patent it is easy for 20 years before the competition. "" worldwide resonance "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seems to be a leader in the" Open Source "breeding, the concept is spreading quickly around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which itself describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, is a" open-source seed plant "centre and helps them to breed new varieties, meet the specific requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seed and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organization Agrel operates at an" open source "licence, which ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi commitment to breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(regulations for breeders differ from land to land, absent due to the Ossi obligation is not just one can be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patented. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European patent."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"there is no explanation, but there is no law; now it is to the governments of the Member States to implement the Patent Office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference to" Open Source "seed companies in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed banks and seed companies from all East Africa to learn something about the" Open Source "seed movement and the global trend towards Patenting of seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for the" Open Source "program for" Open Source "seed systems that the organisation is currently being set up a worldwide alliance for" Open Source "seed systems for the scheduled next year of the official starting signal."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a merger from environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit organization USC Canada and the Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food and organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - will represent the view that farmers should have the opportunity to make it a stable supply of food security."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"in the report, the importance of a diverse, local supply with seed for sustainable food systems is emphasized - a link between the Luby of Ossi hopes to recognize him soon."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the motion for regional and ecological food is particularly respected, where and how little is grown, and seeds are hardly played a role," so Luby. "we are now trying to make people clear that even more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked off more than two months of 21 websites, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic-speaking edition of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network for alleged" support of terrorism.

<seg id="2733">His article turn mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed itself on the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"however, to lock blogs is very old, but has no priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi. and even if the blocking of blogs may not be meaningless for the world, so it is for two reasons for me:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It happened to them to convey the feeling of an accusation; A arrest, a seeker murder, unloading by the National Security Council, the lock blogs and any other web site for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) You have shown that I was not in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only one small audience."</seg>

<seg id="2739">"first, I used it to the item to handle censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"however, after they have blocked him, and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
