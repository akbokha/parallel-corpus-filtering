that is James R@@ isen .
perhaps you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times reporter .
&quot; long before someone heard by Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book where he was spectacular that the NSA would have heard illegal teleph@@ ones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence service in which the CIA literally transferred designs for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has identified and asked him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this train , he became the symbol of the government of the government , W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer and to discuss journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Treaty , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right to use this information , if the media cannot protect this information , and if they cannot protect it . &quot;
&quot; so when the government had ank@@ le on R@@ isen , he did something that many cour@@ ageous reporter already did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go into prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk of going into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , only days before the process , something exceptional happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , even though it was essential for years that it would have been vital for its case , the demands of the government were dropped to R@@ isen . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the reporter and sources are becoming less hiding .
&quot; instead of failure and ra@@ wn@@ ings to bring statements , that might also do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and thus , the investig@@ ators , without his understanding , concerned his phone calls , &quot;
&quot; like its e @-@ mail data , financial and ban@@ quet information , its credit card , and even travel speeds with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA @-@ w@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer and cra@@ b . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised him to protect W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer . but instead , Justice has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how that can be a problem , especially because the government has taken too much of their work as secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article about national security was the result that a W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so , we put the press coverage of the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional complaints , because the government has always has more possibilities to submit all . &quot;
&quot; but just as the technology of the government permits to handle the rights of rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better . &quot;
&quot; and indeed , they can record that from the moment in which they contact us , rather than in the fall , in sight . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software , which had not yet been written as R@@ isen , and it is significantly more secure than normal emails or telephone calls . &quot;
&quot; such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source transition system for W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer who was originally developed by the website of Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is now been developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , which I have been working . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , like the Washington Post here . &quot;
&quot; there you can also upload documents or send information , as with any ordinary contact form . &quot;
&quot; these will then be encrypted and stored on a server , to which the respective news agency has access . &quot;
&quot; so the government can do no more information secretly , and many of the information that would like to request would not be available in advance . &quot;
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments on all over the world develop new Sp@@ ion@@ ag@@ et@@ technologies that all of us are dangerous . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to ensure that not only supplier of technology such as Edward Snow@@ den would have an opportunity to bring ini@@ quities . it is just as important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , &quot;
&quot; the lack of abuse in the supply of soldiers must be modest and of over@@ filled hospitals , or the next environmental workers , the alarm to the contam@@ inated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider that warns us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies have not only been made for those who want to un@@ cover crimes , but to protect our legal rights . &quot;
thanks .
&quot; &#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the biggest data le@@ ck of history was revealed . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; reveal that the rich and M@@ ight &#93; have been hidden in control v@@ ases . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness by an explanation . &#93; this week we were sent out of news about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents of the firm Mos@@ ch@@ ca . &quot;
the publication of these documents sets a small gli@@ mp@@ se into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we will receive an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies such as Mos@@ Pun@@ ching Fon@@ se@@ ca go and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up that ? &quot;
&quot; in fact , we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has re@@ signed .
reports are also reports that a consortium of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bashar al @-@ Assad has in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it is said that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin leads , a close friend from children &apos;s days , a famous Cel@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people and others , the nervous waiting for the next release , and to the next reveal documents . &quot;
now that sounds like the plot of a agent or John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
&quot; weeping seems away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we expect that ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and mighty are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and that concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; in the whole world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens of some few are used to hide their assets and w@@ ob@@ s@@ essed -- something that we have been discussing and revealed for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people appears very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is difficult to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ases work . &quot;
I always present it as a Mat@@ r@@ j@@ os@@ ch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so , one company has a company in another company , in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind these bones . &quot;
it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters .
I think it &apos;s also interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter .
&quot; probably , because there has been no prominent American so far , that in these revel@@ ations , this scandal came forward . &quot;
now it is not so that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortune in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; however , through the principle of which these tax ha@@ v@@ ases work , Mos@@ que Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; would we have a data le@@ ak of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples that have the connections in the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that in some US states less information needs to give less information to found a company than to obtain a library . &quot;
this type of in@@ dem@@ entia in the US has allowed employees from school districts to swal@@ low school children .
it also allows che@@ aters to wi@@ pe especially vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of conduct which affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a covered investigation into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ators had to come to the United States as an African minister , who wanted to buy a house to buy a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; we really sho@@ cked us , that everyone had made suggestions for our investig@@ ators , how he could transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; these were all pre@@ limin@@ aries . none of these lawyers received us as a client , and of course no man was handed over to the money . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as individual cases .
&quot; it is not about a single lawyer , which leads to our uncovered investig@@ ator proposals . &quot;
&quot; it is not about a single top pol@@ iti@@ ker , wrapped in a scandal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , established corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we need to change the rules . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
&quot; this may sound very comfor@@ ting , as if we could not do anything against it ; if nothing has ever changed , as if there is always the rich and powerful . &quot;
but as a borro@@ wed optim@@ ist I see that quite a lot has started to change .
&quot; over the last few years , we have seen pre@@ ference to more transparency , affecting the owners of companies . &quot;
political attention was discovered by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; since then , the EU has been recorded in central tab@@ s at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it . &quot;
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the USA are lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure the United States and global for more transparency . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind illu@@ stri@@ ans .
&quot; we need executives in the economy , which stand up and say , &quot; In@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; we need leading politicians that recognize the problem , and use it to end the laws of in@@ dem@@ entia by laws . &quot;
&quot; together , we can finally finish the in@@ transparent , which is now able to finish this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ undering . &quot;
this is the story how I was almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and in the trunk to a red Maz@@ das .
&quot; one day after I had completed my design studies , I made a back@@ yard . &quot;
a type in a red Maz@@ da stayed and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works .
he was alone in the city and made a road trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
&quot; he did the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought : &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just didn &apos;t know it ! he says he would go to the Peace of Peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans this . I don &apos;t want to ab@@ duc@@ ted in the suitcase of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard me saying : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
a voice in my head said : &quot; u@@ h as please ?
&quot; at night I lay in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling , and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what have I broken down here ? &quot;
a game of game sleeps in my living room .
what if it &apos;s crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I got from the bed , to ti@@ lt the door to the door , and my sleeping door lock . &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in touch .
&quot; the artwork , which he bought from me , depends today in his class@@ room . he is a teacher now . &quot;
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely altered my angle .
&quot; perhaps the people who were sold in childhood as strangers were , actually friends who were waiting for waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; to accommodate people on my air mattress , it was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s make a jump , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost ple@@ dged , my ro@@ omm@@ ates and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that there were at that time a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I think , creativity can easily be transformed into fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new fellow occup@@ ants Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I think we could earn something like this . our apartment will stay on a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mat@@ rat@@ ory and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress in a wooden floor .
they found it great and we too .
I am sure to decor@@ ate our cheese ham or@@ ac@@ el@@ ettes completely different because we made it for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and passed the door to the castle , Brian and I joined us . &quot;
we just discovered that we could find new friends and pay our rent at the same time ?
things got into rolls .
&quot; my former ro@@ omm@@ ates , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept .
&quot; we presented the investors : &quot; &quot; we want to create a web site , on the people public images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind room , whose doors you closes when it comes to pass . &quot;
&quot; on the Internet , they can then invite wildlife to stay with them . &quot;
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the rocket would ign@@ ite .
but she did not .
&quot; no one who is still very near , would invest in a shop that allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people . &quot;
why ?
because as children all have learned that foreigners are dangerous .
&quot; when one has a problem , one remembers the things you can . we were able to design . &quot;
&quot; at the Kunst@@ akademie , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience . &quot;
&quot; we learned how to design@@ ate objects on how to create objects , but now we wanted to do through design imm@@ ick confidence , between people who never met before . &quot;
can design afford such a bit ?
is it possible to create confidence with design ?
&quot; I would like to give you a taste , which degree is confidence . &quot;
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone in hand .
&quot; now , I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone . &quot;
give your un@@ locked mobile phone your left seat .
&quot; this quiet drive of panic , which you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door . &quot;
&quot; your home is the only one , what more personal than your mobile phone is your home . &quot;
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , you &apos;ll see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked mobile phone of a fore@@ igner in the hands ?
most of them feel responsibility .
so the most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only this reason our company can exist .
just so who has actually Al Go@@ res mobile ?
&quot; could you announce , please , on Twitter that he di@@ fies for the Office of the President ? &quot;
you can now return the cell phones now .
you have experienced now what kind of confidence we want to build . I want to tell you some discover@@ ies .
what if we had changed a little detail on this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor had only been imag@@ ined with his name , if he &apos;d say , where he comes from whence he comes as his dog or his children ? &quot;
&quot; imagine you would have 150 ass@@ ess@@ ments , which all say : &quot; he can really hold fast off mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel then when you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ covered feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning we have done some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to give negative ass@@ ess@@ ments .
&quot; finally , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest received their ass@@ ess@@ ments before we set them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we performed a study with Stan@@ ford study . we examined how probably it is that people trust one another , depending on how they are themselves regarding the age and residence . &quot;
&quot; surprisingly , we trust the people most that are the most similar . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less trust we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social standard .
&quot; it is exciting , when you add the call to a person -- in our case by ass@@ ess@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; if you have less than three ass@@ ess@@ ments , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but one has more than ten , changes everything . &quot;
a good reputation has simil@@ ar@@ ities .
&quot; so , the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep roots . &quot;
&quot; moreover , we knew that trust is dependent on it , how much one is reas@@ onably priced . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you &apos;re telling too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; you are talking about how , for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother , -- &quot; &quot; the request is also not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree in op@@ enn@@ ess , such as &quot; T@@ olle art pieces in your apartment ! I do with my family vacation . &quot;
how to create design with design to make this degree of op@@ enn@@ ess ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give advice on which topics you should write .
&quot; our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help , to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against strangers . &quot;
what we did not expect was the large amount of people who were more than willing to put these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take our offer .
you can recognize three things .
first : incredibly much happiness .
second : the un@@ ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need that had not been covered before .
for us the business works very well .
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smooth . &quot;
there were guests who have been allowed to celebrate parties or apartments have been devast@@ ated .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front front when confidence was broken .
there &apos;s nothing worse than this calls . it &apos;s pain@@ ed if I just think of it .
&quot; dis@@ appointment you hear in the voice of the voice , and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us further . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , only one brood had a fraction of 123 million people . &quot;
for man confi@@ ded to each other .
&quot; when confidence works , there cannot be a miracle . &quot;
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack there .
his host drove him into hospital .
he even sp@@ ends blood for the necessary operation !
here is its assessment :
perfect home for travelers who tend due to sitting activities on heart attack .
the area is beautiful and furnished with adequate hospitals .
&quot; Javier and Alej@@ andra are real prot@@ ector , who save one lives , even though they don &apos;t know it . &quot;
&quot; you drive a car in the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books . &quot;
&quot; you can even stay longer , without paying the extra @-@ nights . &quot;
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; this is , of course , not every stay . &quot;
but these relations behind the pure money transactions are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
&quot; for the first time I stum@@ bled across these words , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is about an economic trade .
&quot; but it is simply to call &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not just . &quot;
Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
&quot; people make a part of themselves open , and that changes everything . &quot;
&quot; it is efficient and reliable , but it is efficient and reliable , but less authenti@@ cally . &quot;
&quot; however , what would be if trips would be a rich buffet of local impressions ? &quot;
&quot; what would be , if in any place you visited , a group would wait there to fill a thor@@ ough and one at a bar tour neighborhood , of which one has never heard ; &quot;
or when cooking could cook from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to privacy principle . &quot;
what would we like if we would like apartments to make a row ?
what would that look like ?
what would be if cities would have the thought of a common share ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and sl@@ ot@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; this project has already begun in South Korea , Seoul , which belonged to the government &apos;s government , &quot;
&quot; now the people were offered . students who were searching for a lead , &quot;
have been medi@@ ated to people whose children were drawn up . there were incub@@ ated programs that were incub@@ ated .
&quot; to share new start @-@ ups in the share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest with a fore@@ igner or even hosts . &quot;
so the idea seems to be not so crazy as it was taught us .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality gave it even before .
similar websites were before us .
so why has just worked our work ?
&quot; apart from happiness and tim@@ ing , we know that you can find the right design with the inventory of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ root pre@@ judi@@ ces .
&quot; I think that &apos;s amazing , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it when a red Maz@@ da goes on me .
of course we know that design can not solve any problem .
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design soon . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think when you view me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; supp@@ ressed , or supp@@ ressed , a terrorist la@@ undering ? &quot;
or simply a del@@ aying in the airport at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
&quot; so , the media represent people that look like me like . &quot;
a study revealed that 80 % of coverage over Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : the Americans think most would not know any Muslims .
presumably the people do not speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for those who have never met an Muslims , it is great to know you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double Espresso , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ s @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ k@@ erin
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I was not born so born . &quot;
I decided to make this decision .
&quot; when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ te me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a homos@@ exual man , like some of my friends , but as Muslim . I decided to wear my head cover . &quot;
my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why are you supp@@ ressed yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the fact that earlier was : for me , it was a femin@@ ist Declaration of Independence , and in contrast to the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt to a perfect and un@@ ri@@ able beauty deal . &quot;
I have not just passive the faith of my parents .
I have in the Koran .
&quot; I read it , thought after , posed in question , doub@@ ted and believed . &quot;
my relationship to God was not love at first sight .
she was confidence and slow de@@ vot@@ ion that deep@@ ened with each reading of the Kor@@ ans .
the beauty of rhyth@@ mi@@ k sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; did you ever feel that anybody you perceive , you complete , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
it feels like that .
&quot; later I married and began how all the good Egyptians , my career as engineering . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and was basically the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot; &quot;
then came the aw@@ ful morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had ended at the end , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; Eil@@ een . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , air@@ crafts in buildings , people wan@@ gen from the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock turned out quickly in indig@@ nation .
why should I do something like that ?
&quot; I switched to the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... , &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not only my country attacked , but in the N@@ u changed the actions of others from a citizen in a susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and start with the post@@ graduate studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember , as I was silent -- when we thought I was silent -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was afraid to be recognized as the Muslim . &quot;
we moved to our apartment in this night in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; and then I heard , and when I heard the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; be careful , &quot; &quot; lead in well illuminated areas , &quot; &quot; T@@ ail@@ ure you not . &quot;
I stayed in the whole week .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day where Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; and again , the war@@ nings : &quot; don &apos;t go to this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably , and I also heard of attacks in Muslims , or by people who were in Muslims , were crushed and struck . &quot;
there were really Bran@@ ches on Mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt not felt right .
&quot; because people who attacked this land , attacked our country . &quot;
I dis@@ miss the rage of people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was angry .
it is not easy to explain .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays people can say : &quot; there &apos;s a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and join mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
it only raises the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or good ?
you know : a mal@@ icious tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor just under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the United States , but a vital organ . &quot;
thanks !
Muslims are inventor and teacher , educ@@ ators and Olymp@@ ion@@ a@@ ics . &quot;
will the closure of Mos@@ ques America make safer ?
&quot; maybe a few places are free , but not stop the terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mosque is leading to consider people of other faith , and show bigger civil participation . &quot;
&quot; and like me , a leader of the police in the Washington area recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in front of a computer .
&quot; in the radic@@ alization process , it has been determined that it begins online . as a result , the person will cut off the person from their assembly , so that the extre@@ mi@@ stic group can make a brain wash , and everyone who abh@@ ors their behaviour and ideology , is a tra@@ itor or ab@@ dic@@ tive by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must keep the people going to the mosque . &quot;
some will still maintain Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS made its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a person , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would add to their job creation if you recognize it as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
&quot; but when one thro@@ ws a look at them , they do not p@@ ave what they read in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they can read these things into the Scri@@ ptures .
an outstanding image told me a amazing story :
&quot; a girl came to him , because they join the IS to join the IS . &quot;
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ erg@@ y@@ man , with whom she spoke , brought her to silence , and told her that her wrath would be in trouble for un@@ righteousness in the world . &quot;
&quot; nothing inspired by nothing and something that would have been given to their anger , it was a major goal for instrum@@ ent@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who would have a solution . &quot;
this image presented the connection to God and its community .
&quot; rather than acc@@ use them for their anger , he showed her con@@ structive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mosque , she kept trying to join the IS . &quot;
that was a gli@@ mp@@ se of how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone ?
how does the 24 hour consumption work out of fear every day on our democracy ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ science studies - show : if we fear you will happen at least three things .
&quot; we accept a author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formity and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study shows : if you report messages in which negative about Muslims , they rather agree more military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not only an academic problem .
&quot; when looking at the mood at the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- it happened three times , but never happened in the context of terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the advance of the Iraqi War and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool to mani@@ pulation the public to explo@@ it the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first but the toxic air of fear harm us all .
&quot; in the assignment of collective , it is not only about to explain to themselves . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was an athl@@ ete .
&quot; he was in the dental Faculty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person he knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was intri@@ gu@@ ing and said :
&quot; when is from my breasts , such a diversi@@ fied young man ? &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks after visiting Su@@ zanne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , was murdered , the same as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who had posted in her apartment as with a execution of Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he shot eight times at De@@ ah .
&quot; fan@@ at@@ ism can not only be un@@ mor@@ ally , but also fatal . &quot;
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mosque or did we stay safely at home ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was no easy decision , because it was about us to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one where we can freely pract@@ ise our religion . &quot;
we chose to the mosque .
&quot; we drove to the mosque with our son in the kinder@@ garten , with high pressure to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took out , and pulled out my shoes , and went into the building , and what I saw , let me stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the im@@ m made an announcement , and he welcomed our guests , for the half of the assembly were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , ath@@ ei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who had come to join us , not to join us . &quot;
&quot; at that moment , I am collapsed . &quot;
these people were there because they had prec@@ eded courage and compassion .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from the moment of anxiety and fan@@ at@@ ism ?
will you be going to be safe ?
or will you connect to those that mean : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thanks beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia - you seem to have taken a ner@@ v .
&quot; but I wonder what do you say , that you may say that you are looking for a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a thought of deep mind , thus an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I am perfectly normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; when you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted in Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
&quot; so , in no respect , I am an exception . &quot;
&quot; if people appear like an exception to rule , the rule is often broken , and they are not the exception to rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you very much . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; as a platform for Bast@@ ler , a billi@@ on@@ aire is about to become a billi@@ on@@ aire . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . it is made possible in research institutions around the world . &quot;
&quot; before air Pak@@ s entered into our social consciousness , a autonomous fleet of flight machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es . &quot;
connect flying sets high speed and acceleration in the smallest space .
they can also build self @-@ constantly supporting structures .
&quot; they have learned to carry bur@@ dens , to deal with tur@@ bul@@ ations and respond to natural laws . &quot;
&quot; today , we want to show you a few of our new projects . &quot;
our goal is to sur@@ pass the limits of possibility in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order to create an autonomous system , it has to be collective , where the mobile objects can be found in the space . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ET@@ H Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this allows us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratories . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , calculations on board which should do the machine . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available at the highest level , e.g. &quot; start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear starter , &quot;
&quot; a flight device , which tries to beat two flies using a cap . &quot;
&quot; like other Star@@ r@@ amps , it is efficient in advance , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; unlike most starting @-@ fle@@ ets , it can be ho@@ ver , and thus has great benefits at start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a swe@@ eping page . &quot;
a limitation of he@@ dge@@ cut@@ ters is that they react sensiti@@ vely to tur@@ bul@@ ations such as wind turbines .
we develop new controllers and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight device doesn &apos;t matter in which location can recover the optimal position and improves the performance by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often ask ourselves fundamental abstra@@ cted questions that penet@@ rate the core of the matter . &quot;
&quot; for example , such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ? &quot;
there are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question .
&quot; Hel@@ icop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts , which met together to inj@@ ure you . &quot;
&quot; for decades , trained pilots were flying remote @-@ controlled flying instruments , which had only two mov@@ able parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear ru@@ dder . &quot;
&quot; long ago , we discovered that flies with just one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simple remote controlled flight device . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it only has a moving part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no valves , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside the inner life much , that it can fly stable , and can move crowded in space . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the he@@ dge@@ way . to bring it to flies , I must throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood to throw it right when I see all , is low , therefore I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; when Mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in satisfaction , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , one exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is very symm@@ etri@@ cal .
that is why it is equivalent in its alignment .
&quot; as a result , he receives the au@@ ral skill , &quot;
&quot; in the room to move in all directions , no matter what direction he is directed or even as he rot@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; a lot is conc@@ ei@@ vable in models , the rest is being learned directly with flying . &quot;
let &apos;s see that .
&quot; when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two prop@@ eller aircraft machines .
this turns clock@@ wise in clock@@ wise
and the other against the clock@@ wise .
&quot; when one builds it , they behave like a high @-@ performance squares . &quot;
&quot; however , something wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , electronics or a battery - can continue to fly the machine if also restricted . &quot;
we will now demonstrate that we make a half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration was investigated by synthetic swar@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
&quot; we participated in the micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter , each one weighs less than a slice of bread -- and they out@@ fit them with loc@@ alization technology and algorith@@ ms . &quot;
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
&quot; hopefully , do you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas . &quot;
the especially secure machine da dr@@ ones wants to become a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
&quot; for guys , such as the reward in development and the Schaff@@ ens@@ act . &quot;
&quot; it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it is creative , smart gifts to form them in so spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential .
thank you very much .
&quot; more than 1.3 billion years ago in a very far distant galaxy , two black holes were always faster , they turned the mass of three suns in a tenth way in pure energy . &quot;
this short time enlighten@@ ed them brigh@@ ter than all the galax@@ ies in all galax@@ ies of the whole universe .
it was a great cre@@ st .
but their energy was not set free in the form of light --
&quot; finally , we speak of black holes . &quot;
the entire energy was given into space @-@ time emotions and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we arrange the events first time .
&quot; just before 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell life was created on earth . &quot;
&quot; since then the Earth has brought quite a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , Sau@@ rier , humans and -- God arise with -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; some 25 years ago , a group of particularly cour@@ ageous -- R@@ ai Weiss was decided by MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from C@@ alt@@ ech -- a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are approximately through col@@ li@@ ating black holes . &quot;
most widely held them for crazy .
&quot; but enough people recognized them as a mad gen@@ ius , so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , design , design and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ omet@@ ry gra@@ vit@@ ation @-@ Ob@@ servatory . &quot;
&quot; during the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o was significantly increased , which improved the detection capacity . &quot;
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a last test run to clari@@ fy some smaller , hard @-@ ne@@ cked problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ant black holes passed through the earth . &quot;
they walked through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hughes : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the part@@ ing of my ra@@ king father &apos;s father .
&quot; basically , they were the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; all this , what I had worked , is no longer Science Fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studied gra@@ vit@@ ation of black holes and their serv@@ ic@@ at@@ oria such as Lig@@ o measur@@ able signals . &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cr@@ isp@@ y in the emotions of space and time .
&quot; when crossing the shaft , the space and its entire content will expand into one direction and into the other . &quot;
to illustr@@ ate lec@@ turers in courses of rel@@ ativity often a really al@@ ber@@ ty dance .
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous , are ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched out and squ@@ ared by the waves . el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that means 20 N@@ ul@@ ls after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . therefore , one explained the lig@@ o staff for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , which is already absurd , this length must be measured in less than a thou@@ sand@@ th of the radius of a nuclear program . this is gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k . &quot;
at the end of his classic Tex@@ ts about Gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt after the waves : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such determin@@ ants are powerful . &quot;
but physi@@ cists are inv@@ entive and with the support of the public will surely be overcome all obstacles .
&quot; in 1973 , Thor@@ ne had released this success in 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to Lig@@ o . Scott claims that Lig@@ o is more an ear than one eye .
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wave length , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell phone . &quot;
this is quite convenient . because so you can make a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving it from several points of light around you .
&quot; in killing , this is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; therefore it is very hard , actually impossible to make a picture of things that especially mean you : &quot;
the face of your child .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close on the story behind . &quot;
&quot; right now , Alice speaks . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interru@@ pts them , &quot;
&quot; number Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can do with them no easy images of objects in all .
&quot; but by clicking on changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
&quot; at least , Lig@@ o measured the measured frequency measured in the audi@@ ble area . &quot;
&quot; so when we convert wave pattern in sound , we can hear all that literally . &quot;
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ation to lau@@ ght , I can tell us much about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , where@@ with my colleague Scott worked very long . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , circular : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; rotate the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same cir@@ cus with an additional sound change . it sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu ! &quot;
&quot; it is a type of movement , shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- heard Lig@@ o the following : &#91; Sur@@ render of sound &#93; J@@ ill , who knows what he has to hear , recognize that as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes each with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which is about as fast as the rods of your sha@@ ker . &quot;
AA : how do we consider what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the most dense body in all , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve each hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine this forces .
fantastic .
and we know it because we have heard .
there is the lasting importance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o eb@@ ra@@ ins a completely new way to explore the Al@@ ls as it was never before .
on this way we can listen to the space and the invisible .
much in all we can -- practically or basically -- not seeing .
&quot; super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why massage star in Super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de . &quot;
they are very useful . of them we have learned a lot about the space .
&quot; the exciting physical processes occur in the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never see you because these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ation waves penet@@ rate iron , as it would be transparent glass . the pri@@ st@@ all : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the urine is conce@@ aled by his own reproduction . &quot;
&quot; with gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and most import@@ antly : I am optimi@@ stic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen and of which we never see no idea . things that we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o was right in the first stop things we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , such as Lig@@ o , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
they are enormous and ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are the cro@@ wning bone for our archaeological work .
&quot; Lig@@ o allows us to make a completely different perspective on events in all , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately , as we went out of this chaos . &quot;
&quot; AA : the challenge is now , as cour@@ ageous as possible . &quot;
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and the sound of the cos@@ mos . &quot;
we need ideas for new Ob@@ serv@@ at@@ ories -- a completely new generation from Ob@@ serv@@ atories on Earth and All .
&quot; what could be nic@@ er , than what could I listen to the urine itself ? &quot;
now the time is great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; a year long I would say &quot; Yes ! &quot; I was afraid of whom I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it did me nervous , I took me in un@@ pleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start singing with her ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly that which I was , w@@ ov@@ or I was afraid , I removed my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , to keep speech@@ es , my social anxiety -- Pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me . &quot;
&quot; but there was a definite yes , which changed my life deeply , on an unexpected art . it started with a question of my little ones . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls for un@@ explained reasons all &quot; Bi@@ bs , &quot;
than if she would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; kit@@ ten , I need milk for my sn@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; she asked her once , if I could play with her when I was on the jump . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; a new life setting in my family . from then on , I swe@@ pt to play with them as soon as you do . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I say always Yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I make trouble very much . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family . &quot;
but it also has an intri@@ gu@@ ing side effect : just recently I understood that the &quot; Yes &quot; -@@ S@@ agen to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am a author . I think things come from you wake up .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I &apos;m producing television .
I do TV in large style .
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for making up 70 hours of program into the world . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of TV . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
every programme offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for a television set can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days with four shows , i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts , the same time in production , times four , 16 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
&quot; in America , my TV series are running on Thursday night . &quot;
&quot; throughout the world , my series production runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts , which I have created itself and not only produced , so I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans for camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours of TV , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that are around the world . &quot;
do you know who still makes it ?
&quot; no one , that &apos;s why I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you with it .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
&quot; I say it to you , that all of you who work so hard if you &apos;re now a company , a country or a class@@ room to take me seriously when I say of work , so that I say : I understand that there is no dream about dreams . &quot;
&quot; everything is a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , everything , and anything . &quot;
&quot; I work much , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I &apos;m deeper into the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work creates always a country out of nothing .
&quot; it is , when I set up troops , I painted on a screen . &quot;
&quot; as a dream , you have a high tone , lie@@ u a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting and distur@@ bing , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and maternal , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing , is the sum@@ s . &quot;
there is so a change in me when the work is working well .
&quot; a sum@@ s starts in my head , and it grows and grow , and the sum@@ s listen to it as a busy road , I could always ride for her . &quot;
&quot; many people assume , if I tell them the sum@@ s that I speak my writing , that the writing prepar@@ es to me . &quot;
don &apos;t understand me wrong you do .
&quot; but the sum@@ s -- when I started working with the television production , when I started working and working and working to create and collabor@@ ate , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy . the sum@@ s ! &quot;
the sum@@ s is more than writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum@@ s , you can &apos;t stri@@ ve differently than size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling , not to be different , than to stri@@ ve to size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sum@@ s .
or maybe it also means a work@@ ings .
perhaps it is gen@@ ius .
perhaps it &apos;s E@@ go .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I only know that I &apos;m not for failure , and I only know that I love the sum@@ s . &quot;
&quot; I just want to say to you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want it to question . &quot;
&quot; to make sure more : the more successful I will , the more episodes , the more over@@ bound limits , the more work , the more things happen , the more things I write story , the more expectations I write more . &quot;
&quot; the more I work , to be successful , the more I need to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the land I create , the marathon , I run , the army , the screen , the high tone , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s . &quot;
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I only this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
&quot; revised , over@@ taken , exagger@@ ated . &quot;
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mom is a single working title .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mom will not be there but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; Sh@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ onda Bay . &quot;
they are the children of a Titan@@ en .
you are Baby @-@ Titan@@ en .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sum@@ s heard . &quot;
the sum@@ s of the engine stopped .
I loved my work no more . the engine was out .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same titanium work , 15 hours @-@ days , performed weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a Titan is not giving , clear eyes , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a showing Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just didn &apos;t have fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
all I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s was me .
&quot; so what do you do if that , what to do , the work you love , suddenly infl@@ ating ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some may think : &quot; Heu@@ l you out , the author of the author . &quot;
&quot; but you know , you are doing , you are doing that you are working to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker to be a painter , a painter , Bill Gates , and knows how to feel the sum@@ s , when the sum@@ s stops , who is it then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; if the song listen to my heart , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states @-@ wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; poses a question .
&quot; I am on the way out , late and she says : &quot; Mama , do you like playing ? &quot;
&quot; and I will not say no , I will be aware of two things : &quot;
&quot; first , I must say Yes to everything and second , they don &apos;t have called me &quot; Sh@@ itt@@ ens . &quot; &quot;
she calls no more &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
when is this happening ?
&quot; I leave it when I am Titan and my sum@@ s , and here everything changes before my own eyes . &quot;
and so she says : &quot; Mama you like playing ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
there is nothing special .
&quot; we play and her sisters encounter , we laugh at a lot and I read very dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in sol@@ itude and in lack of sum@@ s , I can do nothing except to adjust . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the country I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they do not exist anymore . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are sticky fingers and dam@@ p kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wa@@ xing pins and the song in which it &apos;s about letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; everywhere , peace and simplicity . &quot;
the air on this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door goes on and an energi@@ zer comes in .
&quot; and that was not immediately , but happens there . &quot;
I feel it .
the sum@@ s comes back slowly .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s . &quot;
and now I feel like I would know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the thing .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it &apos;s something that we have forgotten .
&quot; the sum@@ s , the work@@ around , the titanium ens@@ um@@ men , that is just the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who are you , if I say you , who I am , if I &apos;m using my brain , I forgot what the real sum@@ s is . &quot;
the sum@@ s is no strength and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real sum@@ s depends on love .
&quot; the sum@@ s is the river , which comes from the lust of life . &quot;
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ conscious and peace .
&quot; real sum@@ s igno@@ res the pressure of history , to do the tasks that anticip@@ ate and pressure . &quot;
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
&quot; the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps whis@@ pered God the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; once my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this , as a rule , so that I can liber@@ ate myself as work@@ a@@ he@@ els of every fault . &quot;
it is law ; I have no other choice . I don &apos;t have any other choice if I want to listen to the sum@@ s .
&quot; wish it would be as simple as I wish . I &apos;m not good in play , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t play a sat@@ in , like working . &quot;
&quot; the truth is painful , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I work always because I love it .
I prefer the workplace as at home .
&quot; this confession is painful , because what a man does rather than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well yes , I think . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; &quot; Titan . &quot;
I have to have problems .
&quot; none of them is hard , none of them . &quot;
&quot; we shave around in the garden , back and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we crushed soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; I feel mainly sti@@ ff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always g@@ able according to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the Universe ful@@ fil@@ s me . &quot;
&quot; I play and play , until I ask myself : why have we stopped playing with the games ? &quot;
you can also say it ! they always say Yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you &apos;ll keep me for na@@ ive , for a meeting woman . &quot;
&quot; you probably have right , but you can also do it ! &quot;
you have time !
and you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child finds you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play with me at a maximum of 15 minutes , up to them , that they want to do something else . &quot;
&quot; there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; after 15 minutes , a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or bis@@ cuit replaces me . &quot;
&quot; and speak my teen @-@ daughter for the whole 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , no longer need it . &quot;
&quot; everyone can bring 15 minutes a piece , even on a bad mood day ! &quot;
15 minutes a piece !
&quot; no cell phone , no laundry , no di@@ stra@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , getting ready for children . &quot;
but 15 minutes are in it !
&quot; my children are my goodness , my world . it must not be the children . it &apos;s true to feel the sum@@ s to have a place for his soul . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not about playing with their own kids . it &apos;s about joy , &quot;
around the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
indul@@ ge yourself in the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out and store it .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I will fail and I have victories . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; if you want to play ? &quot; &quot; just for everything I quit when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass more and more . &quot;
15 minutes a piece that can &apos;t allow for 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
&quot; the sum@@ s came back in my spare time . the sum@@ s seems to return , if I don &apos;t work . &quot;
working doesn &apos;t work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months opens a door , the energy comes in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown mel@@ ody , she meets me and my soul . she leads me to new ideas . I use it in full trains and love my work again . &quot;
&quot; I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I &apos;m not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s is not me ... no more . &quot;
soap bub@@ bles and sticky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
now that is my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
&quot; the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so thank@@ ful . &quot;
it &apos;s me mu@@ d@@ ger that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan . I have never seen a Titan &apos;s journey to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and to play more .
and yet I have everything inside . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fires are still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel like a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clear@@ er is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the country that I run , the marathon , whom I run , the troops , the high tone , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the other , the sum@@ s of life : the sum@@ s of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more it makes this unusual , stable , naked and new life feeling in me . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am . &quot;
I am a author . I think things like I &apos;m blowing up for life .
&quot; this is a job , meaning to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and more games .
Titan@@ en have no chance here .
&quot; are you going to play ? &quot;
thanks beautiful .
I am Neuro@@ surgeon .
&quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day . &quot;
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a serious stroke , or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; it is very fru@@ str@@ ating for us that the brain , unlike other bodies , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I was functional neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve function by different surgical interventions .
&quot; certainly , they have heard from one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; deep @-@ spec@@ ulation . &quot; in doing so , it im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neurolog@@ ical function improves . &quot;
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease which suffered severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
&quot; however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgery is the recovery of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close .
&quot; with some help , the brain can help themselves . &quot;
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was senior doctor and worked out day and night in the emergency department .
often I supplied patients with skul@@ ls @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that the brain @-@ brain trau@@ mat@@ a must be attached to the brain and the skull pressure .
&quot; to save life , one must decrease the cran@@ ial pressure . &quot;
sometimes you have to remove a part carved brain mass sometimes .
&quot; instead of s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , the brain mass . &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is no easy task .
&quot; ten@@ ding to grow from a ri@@ f@@ le , is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; the right food , temperature , moisture and environments must be found in order to th@@ rive . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François managed . &quot;
he looked at his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you still know from the biology classes , that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can be transformed into any cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the surgery .
we made a further fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
&quot; never die , they are immort@@ al . &quot;
but these cells were different .
&quot; they were divided slowly , and after a few weeks , they were even dying . &quot;
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells but was different . &quot;
we needed long to understand how they came .
they are from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ c@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cereb@@ ell@@ ation cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
&quot; in the stage of the fet@@ us , it ensure the folding of the brain . &quot;
but why do they remain to us ?
we do not know that .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries . &quot;
but this is not so sure .
&quot; one thing is clear -- of these cells , we received our stem cells . &quot;
&quot; in front of a potential cell source , we allow brain healing . &quot;
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
&quot; we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area , and then the cells begin to cultiv@@ ate how it did Jean @-@ François &quot;
&quot; and then , to mark your colour , to pursue it in the brain . &quot;
&quot; in the last step , we im@@ planted them on the basis of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ ologist transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we im@@ planted these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we im@@ planted the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with monkeys . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario we im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that it had been removed after some weeks , they would go back home . the space is already occupied , so they are not used there , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we put an injury to and re@@ im@@ planted exactly the same cells and now remained the cells -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we could see under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were re@@ im@@ planted .
&quot; the evidence that they show , these small points are . these are the cells that we are coloured in vitro . &quot;
&quot; here we could not stop , of course . &quot;
are these cells even a wise monkeys to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual skill task .
they had to take food pellets for a tablet .
they made it very well .
&quot; as they had achieved a stable level of dex@@ ter@@ ity , we had the mot@@ orized c@@ ort@@ ex range . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in humans , they re@@ treats spontan@@ e@@ ously to a certain degree , just as after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover from plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey reaches his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left , they see the monkey , which repeated spontan@@ e@@ ously . &quot;
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance by injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , see when we im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the m@@ ating plant@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; I can tell you , that were very exciting also for us . &quot;
&quot; since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze it and later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; but our dream still is still , to im@@ pose people with people . &quot;
&quot; I really hope to show you soon , how the human brain gives the means to heal ourselves . &quot;
thank you very much .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know somebody who can do it . &quot;
I definitely fall .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest barriers are before you can start clinical trials involving human subjects . &quot;
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these fantastic results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to fill this type of studies .
&quot; BG : this is understand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yeah , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a fast professional team . &quot;
BG : take a look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to obtain permission to start clinical studies . if you continue to look into the future as many years it will take until someone will be available to the hospital .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on approval of clinical trial . &quot;
is it possible to allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it already needs a long time to select patients who perform treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this type of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , one has to apply this to a multic@@ enter study . &quot;
&quot; first , you really need to prove that it &apos;s useful if you can offer this treatment . &quot;
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and tell us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
&quot; in the West , we make a big mistake to consider it as of course . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant that is in reality , but as inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to look at them as un@@ changeable ge@@ op@@ enn@@ ess .
we believe capitalism leads forced to democracy .
that is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great Nach@@ ah@@ mer in Beijing have definitely proven that it is quite possible to have a flo@@ wering capitalism , impressive growth while Politics is completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy comes to us in Europe . &quot;
at the beginning of the year when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- it was un@@ explained to me that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- do not influence the austerity programs that had been realised in Greece .
&quot; at that moment , I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my reas@@ oning friends who told me that democracy was abolished . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to introduce a economic model for a real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I beg you , together with me to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group in a mistake , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ ensive democracy . &quot;
&quot; without democracy our societies are common , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies are w@@ asted . &quot;
&quot; to the subject of waste , I want to point out to an interesting contra@@ diction that currently threat@@ ens our host . &quot;
I call it the &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and know him as the debt berg , who thro@@ ws his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all realize the debt berg , &quot;
but only few recognize his dy@@ mus .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash which belongs to the ver@@ itable austerity and corporations which could be too frigh@@ tened to invest there , where it could produce productive and income to produce all the things that are urg@@ ently needed , for example , &quot; green energy . &quot; &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months , the U.S. , in England , and in the euro@@ zone , were invested 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars , in all the wealth of manufacturing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on . &quot;
&quot; the 3,4 trillion U.S. dollars sounds too much money until you compare it with the 5.1 trillion U.S. dollars , which were around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except the stock ex@@ changes and the property prices are uploaded . &quot;
&quot; thus , debts and un@@ productive capital constitute the twin peaks that are not equal to the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year old in the USA , Japan and Europe are unemployed , which could not invest a low demand that would not invest in which they might not be investing in which they might kill him , that his son will kill him if he will grow . &quot;
&quot; un@@ intenti@@ onally led the circumstances that lead to it , that le@@ pus kills him . &quot;
this is my hair with capitalism --
&quot; its extremely popular art . All the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , developing human talents and especially all of the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
so democracy is the solution ?
I think so . but before we proceed : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as a social form in which the free and the poor as a majority .
of course the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was made of course too many --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to min@@ ate the job value of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy . &quot;
&quot; the decision at the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they gave the working arms , but not only the right to freedom of expression , but rather more import@@ antly and decisive , which they had the right to political participation in question of state bar . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not held long .
&quot; like a candle that sh@@ ines very bright , she is also dry too quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , our current liberal daily demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a which ultimately became a stat@@ ute for ruling . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy was first entered , as a full separation of politics and economy , and the democratic process was restricted to politics while the economy -- thus the world of corporations -- a democr@@ atically @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in our present demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time , in which this separation of politics and economy began , an in@@ ex@@ orable struggle between the two and the economy gradually emigrated to politics , and they escaped . &quot;
do you wonder why the politicians are no longer like that ?
it is not in a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it is because they can be in the government today , and still not in power , because the power of politics is emigrated to the economy and the areas are separate . &quot;
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it &apos;s about like a herd of boot@@ ees who feeds so sustain@@ ably the animals , of which they are nourished , dec@@ im@@ ed at the end of that time . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is similar to the economy that the politics is so far can@@ alizing that it grows through the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations is growing , the overall economic demand and the managers of the corporations are too anxi@@ ous to invest the cash of their company . &quot;
&quot; more successful in capitalism the &quot; demos &quot; &#91; the people &#93; exp@@ els out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the wealth of mankind . &quot;
&quot; if that &apos;s true , it is obvious that we have to bring together the policy and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; control reserves , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marx@@ ist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not very good .
&quot; the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be , that the labour arm can only achieve a position as a position in the ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is a solution : creating the working arms !
capitalism does it by a low glo@@ omy staff replaced by automation and robot .
&quot; the problem here is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , the automation will be higher the twin peaks , and the social conflicts deeper , as it -- already very soon as I think -- in countries like China will come . &quot;
&quot; so we must re@@ integrate the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we will democr@@ atically democr@@ atically democr@@ atically , in a disease @-@ lasting monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ cracy , which lets the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentary . &quot;
&quot; thus , the question is not whether capitalism has resulted in the technical achievements that he has produced , will survive -- &quot;
&quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism is characterized by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; or by something that put the society in &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; in the machinery , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks to the sense of life . &quot;
I think we must be optimi@@ stic .
&quot; so , what would it be like to look like this &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; like this utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; like similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to call you shortly , some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies : please make a capital market before you earned money while you work and in which your capital will follow you from a work@@ station to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is property of those who currently work in the company . &quot;
&quot; then , all income from capital and income , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the company , but they do not work in it , and employees that work there , but no diving between capital and work , no major g@@ aps between investment and spar@@ es , and ultimately no up@@ lifting twin peaks . &quot;
&quot; in the area of global political economy : please indicate that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which will be issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; in the interest of all mankind . &quot;
&quot; still imagine that the entire world trade is acted in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the country to a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund is inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment is rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes was proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that it was not possible to implement the technical resources back then .
&quot; today , we have them , especially in the background of a re@@ unified policies and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world , which I describe you is at the same time liber@@ ally liber@@ ally , in which they are privileged people , and Marx@@ ist because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash of history , and key@@ nes@@ ian , global key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
&quot; but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy . &quot;
will we wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; Matrix &quot; - similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide to decide politically .
it is in our hands and we do better democr@@ atically .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you give yourself in your biography even as a liberal @-@ Marx@@ ist Marx@@ ist .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s Analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said , is Marx relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do we do this , the technological development is such a massive decline in the overall economic demand , meaning Larry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the transfer of this crisis of a part of the earth to the next one , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ ze our democracy , but also the countries whose interest in liber@@ ally democracy is minimal . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; as Hay@@ ek , therefore , I am a liber@@ t@@ ant Marx@@ ist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am totally in@@ hospitable . &quot;
BG : actually , and now we are well . &quot;
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t throw anymore , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said this . BG : in your lecture , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers , you have clearly said what you think about the view of the West in China . &quot;
would you like to repeat that here ?
Y@@ V : there is a big measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; in our liberal democracy , we have the licence of democracy . &quot;
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy in politics , while the area where most ab@@ ides , -- the area of economy -- a completely democr@@ atically @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in certain ways , when I must say that pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
because -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake .
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stuart Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what can be observed in China now , very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to second . &quot;
&quot; now China has to act now to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells of mighty to hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listeners are curious about your experience as finance minister of Greece in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I knew that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro zone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely ourselves to say goodbye to self @-@ fake , and per@@ sever@@ ance that a massive decline line is through the Eurozone , and continues to massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , based on the Greek pre@@ acher -- by the way , the first suggest@@ ion that revealed this den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the Eurozone , within the European group , have continued the den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable , due to political will@@ s and authorities in life , it will probably not hesitate for a while , but if the change occurs , it happens and de@@ structive and de@@ structive . &quot;
BG : which trans@@ itions do you see ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt about the Eurozone doesn &apos;t have a future if we don &apos;t change their setup .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- appointment marina ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister , or any minister , who claimed after 6 months in office , particularly in a divided situation , that he did not make mistakes , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the request of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in pages of the pur@@ er to find a common solution .
but that was not .
&quot; they just wanted to bring our government to the case , only because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the public@@ ity that ran through the Eurozone . &quot;
they didn &apos;t want to admit they have been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; nobody from the Tro@@ ika of the pur@@ er who has imposed on this policy , said : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ som@@ ed mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all that , and despite the aggressive T@@ ons of the discussions , you seem to be quite per @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone comes from somebody who lives and love Europe .
my greatest fear is that the Eurozone did not survive .
&quot; for if they do not survive , the em@@ akers will be demon@@ ically and destroy the European Union . &quot;
this won &apos;t have disast@@ rous consequences for Europe but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we propose the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what it appears to me , it will be equally acceptable to the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for having been with T@@ ED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; Roy Price has never heard the most yet , although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
probably for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
&quot; Roy Price is senior executive at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the TV production company of Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for producing the shows and the content to produce the Amazon .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t choose any .
&quot; he must find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are located right on this bend . &quot;
this curve is the evaluation process of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the review goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows will receive this rating .
&quot; if your show is given nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows such as &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are ad@@ dic@@ tive where you looked after a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left , here at this end , shows how &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you what is going on this end of the turn . &quot;
Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to instru@@ ct &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the middle training , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they don &apos;t inspire them . &quot;
so he must ensure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes it something , that &apos;s why Roy Price wants to risk nothing . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he takes care of guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and elec@@ ts eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and shows them online where they can watch them for free . &quot;
&quot; and when Amazon is available for free stuff , it is appe@@ aling to , right ? &quot;
millions of viewers are viewing this episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are watching in watching this shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who receive everything .
&quot; when you start the show , when one starts out when you check out what parts you ski@@ p or look again . &quot;
&quot; you collect millions of data , to decide with these data , which show they should produce . &quot;
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process this and hence results the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make an Sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US Sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember that show because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- as the average of this curve 7,4 is and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7,5 -- so slightly above the average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; at the same time in another company , another manager has pl@@ az@@ ed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy is always looking for this a super @-@ show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of stage a competition , he and his team have looked at the existing data via the Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the reviews which they give the shows , their course , which shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use these data to find these small details about the spectators : which shows they like , what producers , which actor . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they went a venture , and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,1 review on this curve . so , exactly where they wanted . &quot;
of course the question is : what happened here ?
&quot; one has two very competent , data sealed companies . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is that ?
because logic somehow states that all should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision that you meet , then you should make a good decision . &quot;
one has 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it is optimized through very powerful computer .
&quot; the Min@@ de@@ ste , what can be expected , is good television , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis is not working so , this is somewhat frigh@@ tening , because we are living in a time in which we need more and more to statistics in order to hit serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anyone know the company &apos;s multi @-@ health system here ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes in touch with this software . come in touch , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if anyone is here in the USA and asking for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a release is done or not . &quot;
&quot; just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but rather than decide whether a show is good or bad , it is decided whether a person is good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results are created . it is not that a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
data based companies are also wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google will sometimes make mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that it is caused by data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the bad way , predi@@ ct -- through data analysis of the Google research . &quot;
it worked wonder@@ fully and was a great news broadcast . success cul@@ minated in a publication in the journal &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked just perfect , year around year , until suddenly it didn &apos;t work anymore , &quot;
and nobody could say why .
&quot; it was simply not working , it was once again a sensation , including the withdrawal of the publication in the journal Nature . &quot;
even the data sealed companies like Amazon and Google are sometimes mis@@ understood .
&quot; in spite of all these errors , the decisions made in decisions of life -- at work , in law , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gen@@ etics -- an area where some very smart people use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions like the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I recognized some pattern of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; ever to solve a complex problem , do mainly two things : &quot;
&quot; as a result , you put this problem in its individual parts , so you can analyse the individual parts ; as a second place you put together the individual parts to hold a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you need to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and return . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
&quot; they are not suitable to res@@ etting the parts again , and then to a dis@@ miss@@ al . &quot;
there is another tool and we all have : our brain .
&quot; if there is something that is good in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces back together , even if the information is incomplete , so that if the brain is an expert -- especially when the brain is an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful , because they also have data and understanding , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use their data to better understand their audience , what else they would not have been able . however , the decision , how to make all these parts , come back together and create a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; this was not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show that it meant that they entered a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they chose TV ideas , then they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as show . &quot;
it was a secure decision because they could always say : &quot; we tell us the data . &quot;
it didn &apos;t lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better choices but I believe things go wrong when data start making our decisions .
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and not to forget it , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will be ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . it is amazing . for decisions using a J@@ a- or No @-@ question , you only have to shake the ball in order to get an answer . &quot; &quot; highly likely &quot; - in this moment . &quot;
&quot; later , I &apos;m going to interpre@@ t it with a technique demo . &quot;
&quot; so far , I have met some decisions in my life so I should hear in the fall of the ball . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by some much more wis@@ er than data analysis to make better choices . &quot;
but this does not change the foundation .
&quot; so perhaps the ball is wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . in the end , it is possible to meet decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging message that , despite the great amount of data still pays off , making decisions to be an expert in what you do is doing and risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks of which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thanks beautiful .
