<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">Perhaps you might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone heard by Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book where he was spectacular that the NSA would have heard illegal telephones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence service in which the CIA literally transferred designs for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has identified and asked him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this train, he became the symbol of the government of the government, Whistleblower and to discuss journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional Treaty, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right to use this information, if the media cannot protect this information, and if they cannot protect it."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government had ankle on Risen, he did something that many courageous reporter already did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, only days before the process, something exceptional happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, even though it was essential for years that it would have been vital for its case, the demands of the government were dropped to Risen."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporter and sources are becoming less hiding.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of failure and rawnings to bring statements, that might also do his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and thus, the investigators, without his understanding, concerned his phone calls,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"like its e-mail data, financial and banquet information, its credit card, and even travel speeds with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-whistleblower and crab."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised him to protect Whistleblower. but instead, Justice has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how that can be a problem, especially because the government has taken too much of their work as secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article about national security was the result that a Whistleblower went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so, we put the press coverage of the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional complaints, because the government has always has more possibilities to submit all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as the technology of the government permits to handle the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and indeed, they can record that from the moment in which they contact us, rather than in the fall, in sight."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software, which had not yet been written as Risen, and it is significantly more secure than normal emails or telephone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such a technology is SecureDrop, an open-source transition system for Whistleblower who was originally developed by the website of Aaron Swartz, and is now been developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which I have been working."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news website, like the Washington Post here."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can also upload documents or send information, as with any ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"these will then be encrypted and stored on a server, to which the respective news agency has access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can do no more information secretly, and many of the information that would like to request would not be available in advance."</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments on all over the world develop new Spionagettechnologies that all of us are dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is possible to ensure that not only supplier of technology such as Edward Snowden would have an opportunity to bring iniquities. it is just as important that we protect the next Whistleblower,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"the lack of abuse in the supply of soldiers must be modest and of overfilled hospitals, or the next environmental workers, the alarm to the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider that warns us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies have not only been made for those who want to uncover crimes, but to protect our legal rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">"[on April 3, 2016, the biggest data leck of history was revealed.] [the" Panama Papers "reveal that the rich and Might] have been hidden in control vases.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness by an explanation.] this week we were sent out of news about a Leck of 11 million documents of the firm Moschca."</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents sets a small glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we will receive an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies such as MosPunching Fonseca go and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up that? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"in fact, we actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">Reports are also reports that a consortium of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is said that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin leads, a close friend from children's days, a famous Cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people and others, the nervous waiting for the next release, and to the next reveal documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of a agent or John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"weeping seems away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we expect that?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and mighty are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in the whole world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens of some few are used to hide their assets and wobsessed -- something that we have been discussing and revealed for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people appears very confusing this whole world, and it is difficult to understand how these tax havases work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always present it as a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so, one company has a company in another company, in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind these bones."</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters.</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it's also interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">"probably, because there has been no prominent American so far, that in these revelations, this scandal came forward."</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not so that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortune in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">"however, through the principle of which these tax havases work, Mosque Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"would we have a data leak of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples that have the connections in the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that in some US states less information needs to give less information to found a company than to obtain a library."</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of indementia in the US has allowed employees from school districts to swallow school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It also allows cheaters to wipe especially vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of conduct which affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covered investigation into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigators had to come to the United States as an African minister, who wanted to buy a house to buy a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"we really shocked us, that everyone had made suggestions for our investigators, how he could transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all preliminaries. none of these lawyers received us as a client, and of course no man was handed over to the money. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">"it is not about a single lawyer, which leads to our uncovered investigator proposals."</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single top politiker, wrapped in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, established corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we need to change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very comforting, as if we could not do anything against it; if nothing has ever changed, as if there is always the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a borrowed optimist I see that quite a lot has started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the last few years, we have seen preference to more transparency, affecting the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">Political attention was discovered by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has been recorded in central tabs at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA are lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure the United States and global for more transparency."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind illustrians.</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need executives in the economy, which stand up and say," Intransparency is not good for business. "</seg>
<seg id="94">"we need leading politicians that recognize the problem, and use it to end the laws of indementia by laws."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together, we can finally finish the intransparent, which is now able to finish this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story how I was almost abducted and in the trunk to a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I had completed my design studies, I made a backyard."</seg>
<seg id="98">A type in a red Mazda stayed and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made a road trip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" where do you sleep tonight? "</seg>
<seg id="104">"he did the whole thing worse:" I don't know yet. "</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought:" Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just didn't know it! he says he would go to the Peace of Peace, but I don't know if he really plans this. I don't want to abducted in the suitcase of a Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard me saying: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">A voice in my head said: "uh as please?</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I lay in bed, I stared at the ceiling, and thought," Oh man! what have I broken down here? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A game of game sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if it's crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I got from the bed, to tilt the door to the door, and my sleeping door lock."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">"the artwork, which he bought from me, depends today in his classroom. he is a teacher now."</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely altered my angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps the people who were sold in childhood as strangers were, actually friends who were waiting for waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"to accommodate people on my air mattress, it was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's make a jump, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost pledged, my roommates and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there were at that time a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I think, creativity can easily be transformed into fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new fellow occupants Brian Chesky:" Brian, I think we could earn something like this. our apartment will stay on a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air matratory and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress in a wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure to decorate our cheese ham oracelettes completely different because we made it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and passed the door to the castle, Brian and I joined us."</seg>
<seg id="134">We just discovered that we could find new friends and pay our rent at the same time?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things got into rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommates, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented the investors:" "we want to create a web site, on the people public images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind room, whose doors you closes when it comes to pass."</seg>
<seg id="139">"on the Internet, they can then invite wildlife to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But she did not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still very near, would invest in a shop that allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children all have learned that foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"when one has a problem, one remembers the things you can. we were able to design."</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the Kunstakademie, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we learned how to designate objects on how to create objects, but now we wanted to do through design immick confidence, between people who never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a bit?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create confidence with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">"I would like to give you a taste, which degree is confidence."</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">"now, I would like to unlock your mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked mobile phone your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">"this quiet drive of panic, which you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door."</seg>
<seg id="158">"your home is the only one, what more personal than your mobile phone is your home."</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, you'll see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked mobile phone of a foreigner in the hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most of them feel responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So the most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so who has actually Al Gores mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">"could you announce, please, on Twitter that he difies for the Office of the President?"</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have experienced now what kind of confidence we want to build. I want to tell you some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor had only been imagined with his name, if he'd say, where he comes from whence he comes as his dog or his children?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"imagine you would have 150 assessments, which all say:" he can really hold fast off mobile phones! "</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel then when you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-covered feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have done some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to give negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">"finally, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest received their assessments before we set them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we performed a study with Stanford study. we examined how probably it is that people trust one another, depending on how they are themselves regarding the age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">"surprisingly, we trust the people most that are the most similar."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less trust we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social standard.</seg>
<seg id="181">"it is exciting, when you add the call to a person -- in our case by assessments."</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three assessments, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but one has more than ten, changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation has similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">"so, the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep roots."</seg>
<seg id="186">"moreover, we knew that trust is dependent on it, how much one is reasonably priced."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you're telling too little, like" Hi!, "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"you are talking about how, for example:" I have problems with my mother, -- "" the request is also not accepted. "</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree in openness, such as" Tolle art pieces in your apartment! I do with my family vacation. "</seg>
<seg id="191">How to create design with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give advice on which topics you should write.</seg>
<seg id="193">"our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help, to overcome our prejudices against strangers."</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the large amount of people who were more than willing to put these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly much happiness.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the untireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business works very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything goes smooth."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have been allowed to celebrate parties or apartments have been devastated.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front front when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There's nothing worse than this calls. it's pained if I just think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"disappointment you hear in the voice of the voice, and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us further."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, only one brood had a fraction of 123 million people."</seg>
<seg id="209">For man confided to each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">"when confidence works, there cannot be a miracle."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him into hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even spends blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is its assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect home for travelers who tend due to sitting activities on heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and furnished with adequate hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real protector, who save one lives, even though they don't know it."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive a car in the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books."</seg>
<seg id="220">"you can even stay longer, without paying the extra-nights."</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"this is, of course, not every stay."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transactions are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"for the first time I stumbled across these words, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but it is simply to call" "rental industry", "the thing is not just."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">"people make a part of themselves open, and that changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="230">"it is efficient and reliable, but it is efficient and reliable, but less authentically."</seg>
<seg id="231">"however, what would be if trips would be a rich buffet of local impressions?"</seg>
<seg id="232">"what would be, if in any place you visited, a group would wait there to fill a thorough and one at a bar tour neighborhood, of which one has never heard;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or when cooking could cook from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to privacy principle."</seg>
<seg id="235">What would we like if we would like apartments to make a row?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What would be if cities would have the thought of a common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships, instead of loneliness and slotation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"this project has already begun in South Korea, Seoul, which belonged to the government's government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">"now the people were offered. students who were searching for a lead,"</seg>
<seg id="241">Have been mediated to people whose children were drawn up. there were incubated programs that were incubated.</seg>
<seg id="242">"to share new start-ups in the share economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest with a foreigner or even hosts."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be not so crazy as it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality gave it even before.</seg>
<seg id="246">Similar websites were before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has just worked our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from happiness and timing, we know that you can find the right design with the inventory of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-root prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I think that's amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it when a red Mazda goes on me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course we know that design can not solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you view me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"suppressed, or suppressed, a terrorist laundering?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delaying in the airport at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">"so, the media represent people that look like me like."</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of coverage over Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans think most would not know any Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Presumably the people do not speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for those who have never met an Muslims, it is great to know you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double Espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtegs-Fitness-Fanatikerin</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga, because, baby, I was not born so born."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to make this decision.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17, I met the decision to oute me."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as Muslim. I decided to wear my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why are you suppressed yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the fact that earlier was: for me, it was a feminist Declaration of Independence, and in contrast to the pressure that I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt to a perfect and unriable beauty deal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not just passive the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have in the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought after, posed in question, doubted and believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship to God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was confidence and slow devotion that deepened with each reading of the Korans.</seg>

<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>

<seg id="287">It feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and began how all the good Egyptians, my career as engineering."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later, after my marriage, I had a child, and was basically the" Egyptian-American dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the awful morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had ended at the end, looked on the screen and saw the word" Eileen. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, aircrafts in buildings, people wangen from the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned out quickly in indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I switched to the television channel and heard:..." Muslim terrorists "...,"... in the name of Islam... "..."... "" Jihad... ""... "</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only my country attacked, but in the Nu changed the actions of others from a citizen in a suspects."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and start with the postgraduate studies."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember, as I was silent -- when we thought I was silent -- so deep it went into my seat, and I was afraid to be recognized as the Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in this night in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then I heard, and when I heard the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said:" be vigilant, "" be careful, "" lead in well illuminated areas, "" Tailure you not. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed in the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in that week -- the day where Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again, the warnings:" don't go to this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal. "</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably, and I also heard of attacks in Muslims, or by people who were in Muslims, were crushed and struck."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really Branches on Mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt not felt right.</seg>
<seg id="314">"because people who attacked this land, attacked our country."</seg>
<seg id="315">I dismiss the rage of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays people can say: "there's a problem in this country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to ban Muslims and join mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It only raises the question: are we malignant or good?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malicious tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor just under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the United States, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventor and teacher, educators and Olympionaics. "</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of Mosques America make safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"maybe a few places are free, but not stop the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque is leading to consider people of other faith, and show bigger civil participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and like me, a leader of the police in the Washington area recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the radicalization process, it has been determined that it begins online. as a result, the person will cut off the person from their assembly, so that the extremistic group can make a brain wash, and everyone who abhors their behaviour and ideology, is a traitor or abdictive by faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalization, we must keep the people going to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still maintain Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS made its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a person, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their job creation if you recognize it as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "Holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when one throws a look at them, they do not pave what they read in their" Holy Scripture. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that they can read these things into the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding image told me a amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">"a girl came to him, because they join the IS to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergyman, with whom she spoke, brought her to silence, and told her that her wrath would be in trouble for unrighteousness in the world."</seg>
<seg id="350">"nothing inspired by nothing and something that would have been given to their anger, it was a major goal for instrumentalization by extremists who would have a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This image presented the connection to God and its community.</seg>
<seg id="352">"rather than accuse them for their anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, she kept trying to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">That was a glimpse of how the Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24 hour consumption work out of fear every day on our democracy?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscience studies - show: if we fear you will happen at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we accept a authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows: if you report messages in which negative about Muslims, they rather agree more military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"when looking at the mood at the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- it happened three times, but never happened in the context of terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the advance of the Iraqi War and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not just the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulation the public to exploit the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first but the toxic air of fear harm us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">"in the assignment of collective, it is not only about to explain to themselves."</seg>

<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we stay safely at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was no easy decision, because it was about us to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one where we can freely practise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"we drove to the mosque with our son in the kindergarten, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took out, and pulled out my shoes, and went into the building, and what I saw, let me stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the imm made an announcement, and he welcomed our guests, for the half of the assembly were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who had come to join us, not to join us."</seg>

<seg id="388">These people were there because they had preceded courage and compassion.</seg>

<seg id="409">"before air Paks entered into our social consciousness, a autonomous fleet of flight machines in the Frac Centre in France has built a six-metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">Connect flying sets high speed and acceleration in the smallest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build self-constantly supporting structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to carry burdens, to deal with turbulations and respond to natural laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">"today, we want to show you a few of our new projects."</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to surpass the limits of possibility in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order to create an autonomous system, it has to be collective, where the mobile objects can be found in the space."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this allows us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratories."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space, calculations on board which should do the machine."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available at the highest level, e.g." start "and" land. ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called rear starter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">"a flight device, which tries to beat two flies using a cap."</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other Starramps, it is efficient in advance, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"unlike most starting-fleets, it can be hover, and thus has great benefits at start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a sweeping page."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of hedgecutters is that they react sensitively to turbulations such as wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight device doesn't matter in which location can recover the optimal position and improves the performance by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often ask ourselves fundamental abstracted questions that penetrate the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">"for example, such a question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?"</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">"Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts, which met together to injure you."</seg>
<seg id="434">"for decades, trained pilots were flying remote-controlled flying instruments, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a rear rudder."</seg>
<seg id="435">"long ago, we discovered that flies with just one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the Monospinner, the mechanically simple remote controlled flight device. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it only has a moving part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no valves, hinges and cross-rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, inside the inner life much, that it can fly stable, and can move crowded in space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the hedgeway. to bring it to flies, I must throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood to throw it right when I see all, is low, therefore I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"when Monospinner is an exercise in satisfaction, this machine is here, the Omnicopter with its eight propellers, one exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is very symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is equivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"as a result, he receives the aural skill,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"in the room to move in all directions, no matter what direction he is directed or even as he rotated."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"a lot is conceivable in models, the rest is being learned directly with flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two propeller aircraft machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns clockwise in clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when one builds it, they behave like a high-performance squares."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, electronics or a battery - can continue to fly the machine if also restricted."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that we make a half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration was investigated by synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">"we participated in the micro-quadcopter, each one weighs less than a slice of bread -- and they outfit them with localization technology and algorithms."</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">"hopefully, do you motivate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas."</seg>
<seg id="463">The especially secure machine da drones wants to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>

<seg id="477">"since then the Earth has brought quite a lot: corals, fish, plants, Saurier, humans and -- God arise with -- even the internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"some 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss was decided by MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which are approximately through colliating black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most widely held them for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">"but enough people recognized them as a mad genius, so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed their idea."</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, design and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser interferometry gravitation-Observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"during the follow-up period, the precision of Ligo was significantly increased, which improved the detection capacity."</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a last test run to clarify some smaller, hard-necked problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliant black holes passed through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They walked through you and me</seg>

<seg id="492">"all this, what I had worked, is no longer Science Fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studied gravitation of black holes and their servicatoria such as Ligo measurable signals."</seg>

<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that Gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous, are ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14, for example, each of us was stretched out and squared by the waves. elongation of an average man was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that means 20 Nulls after the comma, followed by a 1. therefore, one explained the ligo staff for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five-kilometre laser detector, which is already absurd, this length must be measured in less than a thousandth of the radius of a nuclear program. this is grotesk."</seg>

<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt after the waves:" the technical difficulties in the construction of such determinants are powerful. "</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are inventive and with the support of the public will surely be overcome all obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="504">"in 1973, Thorne had released this success in 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott claims that Ligo is more an ear than one eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wave length, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell phone."</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite convenient. because so you can make a picture or a map of things by perceiving it from several points of light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">"in killing, this is different."</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"therefore it is very hard, actually impossible to make a picture of things that especially mean you:"</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close on the story behind."</seg>
<seg id="514">"right now, Alice speaks."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them,"</seg>
<seg id="516">"number Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can do with them no easy images of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by clicking on changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">"at least, Ligo measured the measured frequency measured in the audible area."</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we convert wave pattern in sound, we can hear all that literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"gravitation to laught, I can tell us much about the collision of two black holes, wherewith my colleague Scott worked very long."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotating holes, circular: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"rotate the two bodies very quickly, you hear the same circus with an additional sound change. it sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a type of movement, shaped into the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- heard Ligo the following: [Surrender of sound] Jill, who knows what he has to hear, recognize that as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes each with 30-fold solar mass, which is about as fast as the rods of your shaker."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: how do we consider what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the most dense body in all, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve each hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine this forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it because we have heard.</seg>
<seg id="532">There is the lasting importance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo ebrains a completely new way to explore the Alls as it was never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the space and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can -- practically or basically -- not seeing.</seg>
<seg id="536">"supernova, for example. I would like to know why massage star in Supernovae explode."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we have learned a lot about the space.</seg>
<seg id="538">"the exciting physical processes occur in the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see you because these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitation waves penetrate iron, as it would be transparent glass. the pristall: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the urine is concealed by his own reproduction."</seg>
<seg id="541">"with gravitational waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and most importantly: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen and of which we never see no idea. things that we only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, Ligo was right in the first stop things we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, such as Ligo, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous and ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are the crowning bone for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo allows us to make a completely different perspective on events in all, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately, as we went out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">"AA: the challenge is now, as courageous as possible."</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and the sound of the cosmos."</seg>

<seg id="562">"no, no, no, yes, yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: exactly that which I was, wovor I was afraid, I removed my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear, to keep speeches, my social anxiety -- Puff, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," changed me. "</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a definite yes, which changed my life deeply, on an unexpected art. it started with a question of my little ones."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls for unexplained reasons all" Bibs, "</seg>
<seg id="570">Than if she would be a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kitten, I need milk for my snouts."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she asked her once, if I could play with her when I was on the jump. and I said," Yes. "</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"a new life setting in my family. from then on, I swept to play with them as soon as you do. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I say always Yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I'm not perfect, but I make trouble very much."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an intriguing side effect: just recently I understood that the "Yes" -Sagen to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a author. I think things come from you wake up.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I'm producing television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I do TV in large style.</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible for making up 70 hours of program into the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours of TV. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Every programme offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for a television set can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode every nine days with four shows, i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars TV, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts, the same time in production, times four, 16 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">"in America, my TV series are running on Thursday night."</seg>
<seg id="594">"throughout the world, my series production runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts, which I have created itself and not only produced, so I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans for campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours of TV, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that are around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who still makes it?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, that's why I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">"I say it to you, that all of you who work so hard if you're now a company, a country or a classroom to take me seriously when I say of work, so that I say: I understand that there is no dream about dreams."</seg>
<seg id="603">"everything is a job, all work, everything reality, all blood, everything, and anything."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work much, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I'm deeper into the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work creates always a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, when I set up troops, I painted on a screen."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as a dream, you have a high tone, lieu a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanically, exhausting and disturbing, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing, is the sums."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is so a change in me when the work is working well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a sums starts in my head, and it grows and grow, and the sums listen to it as a busy road, I could always ride for her."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume, if I tell them the sums that I speak my writing, that the writing prepares to me."</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong you do.</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sums -- when I started working with the television production, when I started working and working and working to create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the sums!"</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sums, you can't strive differently than size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling, not to be different, than to strive to size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workings.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it's Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I only know that I'm not for failure, and I only know that I love the sums."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to say to you, I am a Titan, and I know I don't want it to question."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make sure more: the more successful I will, the more episodes, the more overbound limits, the more work, the more things happen, the more things I write story, the more expectations I write more."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work, to be successful, the more I need to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land I create, the marathon, I run, the army, the screen, the high tone, the sums, the sums, the sums."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, overtaken, exaggerated."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mom is a single working title.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom will not be there but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" Shittens, I want to go to Shonda Bay. "</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a Titanen.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are Baby-Titanen.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums heard."</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I loved my work no more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same titanium work, 15 hours-days, performed weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, a Titan is not giving, clear eyes, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a showing Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I just didn't have fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums was me.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do if that, what to do, the work you love, suddenly inflating?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know, some may think:" Heul you out, the author of the author. "</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know, you are doing, you are doing that you are working to be a teacher, a banker to be a painter, a painter, Bill Gates, and knows how to feel the sums, when the sums stops, who is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"if the song listen to my heart, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states-waitress" poses a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way out, late and she says:" Mama, do you like playing? "</seg>
<seg id="673">"and I will not say no, I will be aware of two things:"</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say Yes to everything and second, they don't have called me" Shittens. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">She calls no more "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I leave it when I am Titan and my sums, and here everything changes before my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">And so she says: "Mama you like playing?"</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. "</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and her sisters encounter, we laugh at a lot and I read very dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in solitude and in lack of sums, I can do nothing except to adjust."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they do not exist anymore."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists are sticky fingers and damp kisses, delicate voices, waxing pins and the song in which it's about letting go, or whatever the girl in" The Ice Queen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">"everywhere, peace and simplicity."</seg>
<seg id="689">The air on this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energizer comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that was not immediately, but happens there."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums comes back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a sums."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the thing.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It's something that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the workaround, the titanium ensummen, that is just the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who are you, if I say you, who I am, if I'm using my brain, I forgot what the real sums is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is no strength and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">"the sums is the river, which comes from the lust of life."</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-conscious and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"real sums ignores the pressure of history, to do the tasks that anticipate and pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real sums is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps whispered God the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a little more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"once my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this, as a rule, so that I can liberate myself as workaheels of every fault."</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law; I have no other choice. I don't have any other choice if I want to listen to the sums.</seg>
<seg id="720">"wish it would be as simple as I wish. I'm not good in play, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">"don't play a satin, like working."</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth is painful,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I work always because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer the workplace as at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this confession is painful, because what a man does rather than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well yes, I think."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" "Titan."</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">"none of them is hard, none of them."</seg>
<seg id="731">"we shave around in the garden, back and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We crushed soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel mainly stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always gable according to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sums of the Universe fulfils me."</seg>
<seg id="739">"I play and play, until I ask myself: why have we stopped playing with the games?"</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! they always say Yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you'll keep me for naive, for a meeting woman."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you probably have right, but you can also do it!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child finds you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play with me at a maximum of 15 minutes, up to them, that they want to do something else."</seg>
<seg id="748">"there are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">"after 15 minutes, a Marienkäfer or biscuit replaces me."</seg>
<seg id="750">"and speak my teen-daughter for the whole 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, no longer need it."</seg>
<seg id="752">"everyone can bring 15 minutes a piece, even on a bad mood day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no cell phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, getting ready for children."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my goodness, my world. it must not be the children. it's true to feel the sums to have a place for his soul."</seg>
<seg id="758">"it's not about playing with their own kids. it's about joy,"</seg>
<seg id="759">Around the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Indulge yourself in the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and store it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I will fail and I have victories. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"if you want to play?" "just for everything I quit when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training, when I wanted to surpass more and more."</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a piece that can't allow for 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">"the sums came back in my spare time. the sums seems to return, if I don't work."</seg>
<seg id="768">Working doesn't work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months opens a door, the energy comes in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, she meets me and my soul. she leads me to new ideas. I use it in full trains and love my work again."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the sums, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I'm not the sums, the sums is not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends. "</seg>
<seg id="774">Now that is my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sums of work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so thankful."</seg>
<seg id="778">It's me mudger that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan. I have never seen a Titan's journey to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and to play more.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything inside. my brain is still working. my campfires are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel like a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer is my head."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the sums. the country that I run, the marathon, whom I run, the troops, the high tone, the sums, the sums, the other, the sums of life: the sums of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this sums, the more it makes this unusual, stable, naked and new life feeling in me. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">I am a author. I think things like I'm blowing up for life.</seg>
<seg id="789">"this is a job, meaning to live his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titanen have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"are you going to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">"like most of my colleagues, I have to do with human tragedies every day."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a serious stroke, or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"it is very frustrating for us that the brain, unlike other bodies, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve function by different surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">"certainly, they have heard from one of the most well-known, the" deep-speculation. "in doing so, it implanted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function improves."</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease which suffered severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"however, neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgery is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">"with some help, the brain can help themselves."</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was senior doctor and worked out day and night in the emergency department.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I supplied patients with skulls-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that the brain-brain traumata must be attached to the brain and the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, one must decrease the cranial pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part carved brain mass sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"tending to grow from a rifle, is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"the right food, temperature, moisture and environments must be found in order to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, Jean-François managed."</seg>
<seg id="825">He looked at his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unmature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"perhaps you still know from the biology classes, that stem cells are unripe cells that can be transformed into any cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made a further fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">"never die, they are immortal."</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">"they were divided slowly, and after a few weeks, they were even dying."</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells but was different."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand how they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They are from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebellation cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">"in the stage of the fetus, it ensure the folding of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they remain to us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">"one thing is clear -- of these cells, we received our stem cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">"in front of a potential cell source, we allow brain healing."</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">"we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area, and then the cells begin to cultivate how it did Jean-François"</seg>
<seg id="853">"and then, to mark your colour, to pursue it in the brain."</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we implanted them on the basis of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we implanted these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implanted the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we implanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that it had been removed after some weeks, they would go back home. the space is already occupied, so they are not used there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we put an injury to and reimplanted exactly the same cells and now remained the cells -- they grew to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could see under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence that they show, these small points are. these are the cells that we are coloured in vitro."</seg>
<seg id="863">"here we could not stop, of course."</seg>
<seg id="864">Are these cells even a wise monkeys to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual skill task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets for a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">"as they had achieved a stable level of dexterity, we had the motorized cortex range."</seg>
<seg id="869">"as a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen in humans, they retreats spontaneously to a certain degree, just as after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralyzed and then try to recover from plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just like the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were certain that the monkey reaches his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left, they see the monkey, which repeated spontaneously."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance by injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, see when we implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the mating plantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">"I can tell you, that were very exciting also for us."</seg>
<seg id="878">"since that time, we have found a lot more about these cells."</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">"but our dream still is still, to impose people with people."</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope to show you soon, how the human brain gives the means to heal ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I'm sure that now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think:" I know somebody who can do it. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely fall.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest barriers are before you can start clinical trials involving human subjects."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these fantastic results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to fill this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yeah, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a fast professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: take a look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to obtain permission to start clinical studies. if you continue to look into the future as many years it will take until someone will be available to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on approval of clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Is it possible to allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it already needs a long time to select patients who perform treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this type of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, one has to apply this to a multicenter study."</seg>
<seg id="897">"first, you really need to prove that it's useful if you can offer this treatment."</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and tell us about it."</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">"in the West, we make a big mistake to consider it as of course."</seg>
<seg id="903">"we don't see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality, but as inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as unchangeable geopenness.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism leads forced to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great Nachahmer in Beijing have definitely proven that it is quite possible to have a flowering capitalism, impressive growth while Politics is completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy comes to us in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- it was unexplained to me that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- do not influence the austerity programs that had been realised in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">"at that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my reasoning friends who told me that democracy was abolished."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to introduce a economic model for a real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I beg you, together with me to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup in a mistake, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"without democracy our societies are common, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"to the subject of waste, I want to point out to an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our host."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and know him as the debt berg, who throws his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all realize the debt berg,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But only few recognize his dymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash which belongs to the veritable austerity and corporations which could be too frightened to invest there, where it could produce productive and income to produce all the things that are urgently needed, for example," green energy. ""</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months, the U.S., in England, and in the eurozone, were invested 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars, in all the wealth of manufacturing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"the 3,4 trillion U.S. dollars sounds too much money until you compare it with the 5.1 trillion U.S. dollars, which were around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except the stock exchanges and the property prices are uploaded."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debts and unproductive capital constitute the twin peaks that are not equal to the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 year old in the USA, Japan and Europe are unemployed, which could not invest a low demand that would not invest in which they might not be investing in which they might kill him, that his son will kill him if he will grow."</seg>
<seg id="925">"unintentionally led the circumstances that lead to it, that lepus kills him."</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hair with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"its extremely popular art. All the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, developing human talents and especially all of the technologies," green "technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">So democracy is the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think so. but before we proceed: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as a social form in which the free and the poor as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course the Athenian democracy was made of course too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to minate the job value of the Athenian democracy."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision at the Athenian democracy was and is that they gave the working arms, but not only the right to freedom of expression, but rather more importantly and decisive, which they had the right to political participation in question of state bar."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not held long.</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle that shines very bright, she is also dry too quickly."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our current liberal daily democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta which ultimately became a statute for ruling."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy was first entered, as a full separation of politics and economy, and the democratic process was restricted to politics while the economy -- thus the world of corporations -- a democratically-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our present democracies, since the time, in which this separation of politics and economy began, an inexorable struggle between the two and the economy gradually emigrated to politics, and they escaped."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians are no longer like that?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not in a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because they can be in the government today, and still not in power, because the power of politics is emigrated to the economy and the areas are separate."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it's about like a herd of bootees who feeds so sustainably the animals, of which they are nourished, decimed at the end of that time."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is similar to the economy that the politics is so far canalizing that it grows through the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations is growing, the overall economic demand and the managers of the corporations are too anxious to invest the cash of their company."</seg>
<seg id="948">"more successful in capitalism the" demos "[the people] expels out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the wealth of mankind."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that's true, it is obvious that we have to bring together the policy and the economy, and it would be better if the" demos "control reserves, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be, that the labour arm can only achieve a position as a position in the ancient Athens, without creating new species of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: creating the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by a low gloomy staff replaced by automation and robot.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem here is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, the automation will be higher the twin peaks, and the social conflicts deeper, as it -- already very soon as I think -- in countries like China will come."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we must reintegrate the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we will democratically democratically democratically, in a disease-lasting monitoring hyperautocrcracy, which lets the film" Matrix "as a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"thus, the question is not whether capitalism has resulted in the technical achievements that he has produced, will survive --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the most interesting question is whether capitalism is characterized by a dystopia, similar to the" "Star Trek" "or by something that put the society in" "Star Trek" "in the machinery, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "in long talks to the sense of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so, what would it be like to look like this" star Trek "like this utopia instead of the" "matrix" like similar dystopia? "</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to call you shortly, some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of companies: please make a capital market before you earned money while you work and in which your capital will follow you from a workstation to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is property of those who currently work in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then, all income from capital and income, and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the company, but they do not work in it, and employees that work there, but no diving between capital and work, no major gaps between investment and spares, and ultimately no uplifting twin peaks."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the area of global political economy: please indicate that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which will be issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries] in the interest of all mankind."</seg>
<seg id="966">"still imagine that the entire world trade is acted in this currency -- we call it" the cosmos, "in units of" Cosmos "" -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the country to a common fund. "</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund is invests in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment is rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes was proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that it was not possible to implement the technical resources back then.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, especially in the background of a reunified policies and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world, which I describe you is at the same time liberally liberally, in which they are privileged people, and Marxist because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the trash of history, and keynesian, global keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">"but above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "Matrix" - similar Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to decide politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You give yourself in your biography even as a liberal-Marxist Marxist.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's Analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said, is Marx relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for reunification of politics and economy is... do we do this, the technological development is such a massive decline in the overall economic demand, meaning Larry Summers as" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"through the transfer of this crisis of a part of the earth to the next one, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracy, but also the countries whose interest in liberally democracy is minimal."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"as Hayek, therefore, I am a libertant Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am totally inhospitable."</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are well. "</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't throw anymore, you don't think enough. "</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said this. BG: in your lecture, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers, you have clearly said what you think about the view of the West in China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat that here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a big measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">"in our liberal democracy, we have the licence of democracy."</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy in politics, while the area where most abides, -- the area of economy -- a completely democratically-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in certain ways, when I must say that provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what can be observed in China now, very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"now China has to act now to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells of mighty to hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners are curious about your experience as finance minister of Greece in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I knew that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from personal view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro zone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely ourselves to say goodbye to self-fake, and perseverance that a massive decline line is through the Eurozone, and continues to massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, based on the Greek preacher -- by the way, the first suggestion that revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the Eurozone, within the European group, have continued the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable, due to political wills and authorities in life, it will probably not hesitate for a while, but if the change occurs, it happens and destructive and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: which transitions do you see?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt about the Eurozone doesn't have a future if we don't change their setup.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- appointment marina...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister, or any minister, who claimed after 6 months in office, particularly in a divided situation, that he did not make mistakes, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the request of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in pages of the purer to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they just wanted to bring our government to the case, only because they didn't want to deal with the publicity that ran through the Eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit they have been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"nobody from the Troika of the purer who has imposed on this policy, said:" this was a colossomed mistake. "</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all that, and despite the aggressive Tons of the discussions, you seem to be quite per-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the eurozone comes from somebody who lives and love Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the Eurozone did not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if they do not survive, the emakers will be demonically and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">This won't have disastrous consequences for Europe but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"if we propose the way of a post-modern 1930, what it appears to me, it will be equally acceptable to the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans."</seg>

<seg id="1038">"Roy Price has never heard the most yet, although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">"Roy Price is senior executive at Amazon Studios,"</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelfrisur and describes himself on Twitter as" Movies, TV, Technology, Tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for producing the shows and the content to produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can't choose any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are located right on this bend."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation process of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the review goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows will receive this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is given nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows such as" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addictive where you looked after a season, your brain asks:" where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left, here at this end, shows how" Toddlers and tiaras "-- -- that should tell you what is going on this end of the turn."</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to instruct "Toddlers and tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the middle training, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they don't inspire them."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must ensure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes it something, that's why Roy Price wants to risk nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he takes care of guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and elects eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and shows them online where they can watch them for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and when Amazon is available for free stuff, it is appealing to, right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers are viewing this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are watching in watching this shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who receive everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"when you start the show, when one starts out when you check out what parts you skip or look again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">"you collect millions of data, to decide with these data, which show they should produce."</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process this and hence results the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make an Sitcom over four Republican US Senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha "," but it seems that not many can remember that show because it was not so good. "</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- as the average of this curve 7,4 is and Alpha House landet at 7,5 -- so slightly above the average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"at the same time in another company, another manager has plazed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy is always looking for this a super-show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it something different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of stage a competition, he and his team have looked at the existing data via the Netflix viewers, so the reviews which they give the shows, their course, which shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use these data to find these small details about the spectators: which shows they like, what producers, which actor."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they went a venture, and decided not to make a Sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards ". Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 review on this curve. so, exactly where they wanted. "</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competent, data sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they connect these many data and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that all should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision that you meet, then you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">One has 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized through very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the Mindeste, what can be expected, is good television, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis is not working so, this is somewhat frightening, because we are living in a time in which we need more and more to statistics in order to hit serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company's multi-health system here?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good. "</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes in touch with this software. come in touch, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if anyone is here in the USA and asking for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a release is done or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like at Amazon and Netflix. but rather than decide whether a show is good or bad, it is decided whether a person is good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are created. it is not that a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Data based companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google will sometimes make mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that it is caused by data analysis outbreaks of flu, the bad way, predict -- through data analysis of the Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news broadcast. success culminated in a publication in the journal "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked just perfect, year around year, until suddenly it didn't work anymore,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it was simply not working, it was once again a sensation, including the withdrawal of the publication in the journal Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data sealed companies like Amazon and Google are sometimes misunderstood.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"in spite of all these errors, the decisions made in decisions of life -- at work, in law, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions like the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I recognized some pattern of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"ever to solve a complex problem, do mainly two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"as a result, you put this problem in its individual parts, so you can analyse the individual parts; as a second place you put together the individual parts to hold a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you need to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and return."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">"they are not suitable to resetting the parts again, and then to a dismissal."</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all have: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something that is good in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces back together, even if the information is incomplete, so that if the brain is an expert -- especially when the brain is an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I think was Netflix so successful, because they also have data and understanding, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use their data to better understand their audience, what else they would not have been able. however, the decision, how to make all these parts, come back together and create a show like" House of Cards, "this was not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show that it meant that they entered a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first as they chose TV ideas, then they chose" Alpha House "as show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a secure decision because they could always say: "we tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It didn't lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better choices but I believe things go wrong when data start making our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and not to forget it, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" Magic 8 Ball ". it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No-question, you only have to shake the ball in order to get an answer." "highly likely" - in this moment. "</seg>
<seg id="1131">"later, I'm going to interpret it with a technique demo."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I have met some decisions in my life so I should hear in the fall of the ball."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by some much more wiser than data analysis to make better choices."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the foundation.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"so perhaps the ball is wiser and wiser and wiser. in the end, it is possible to meet decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging message that, despite the great amount of data still pays off, making decisions to be an expert in what you do is doing and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks of which you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
