&quot; Munich , 1856 : four maps that change your look at the city &quot;
an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt where people want to meet youth today .
&quot; a pit chapel , which is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel . &quot;
sm@@ all@@ gar@@ den@@ ers are responsible for the un@@ ru@@ sty reason of farmers .
the oldest official card of Mün@@ ch promotes exciting stories on days .
it &apos;s nervous when maps are not currently up .
everyone knows that ever had to be exciting because the car @-@ Nav@@ i took place a green meadow .
&quot; the historic maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ l@@ ases , an offer of the ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the state government , are all other than currently - but just therefore very reve@@ aling . &quot;
especially when you compare it with current online maps .
&quot; it is clearly evident , as towns and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur has changed since the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a Fli@@ ck@@ ent@@ ep@@ p@@ i , which is not the same as such . &quot;
&quot; the big clear@@ er map were designed for cities and municipalities in more detailed maps , so @-@ called urine leaves . &quot;
&quot; these were originated according to the Bavarian survey@@ ing administration between 1810 and 1864 , and the first survey@@ ing in Bavaria . &quot;
your Client : Napoleon .
&quot; in the spring of 1800 , the French army leader became Bavaria since the Second World War of War with Austria . &quot;
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
&quot; finally , when French troops finally landed with the Peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 1801 : there were today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of an area @-@ wide Bavaria map . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thereby the Bavarian Authority . &quot;
the state @-@ sheet of Munich is from the year 1856 and is like all others at the Bavarian State Library .
&quot; the comparison of early / today is the case of the capital of capital , for example . &quot;
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; an example of this is the send@@ ling , which is still relatively isolated in the 1856 map . &quot;
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was born 21 years after the map of the map , so 1877 , as the Munich district . &quot;
&quot; today , the ou@@ ling lies in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses were concentrated around 1856 along the Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the Bavarian farmers against Austria , 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where the West@@ park is today , you can see nothing as fields - at first glance : in the first sight , a small sequence card with dozens of lines and numbers : hand @-@ written numbered pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ s &quot; from which the basic tax was derived . &quot;
small plots there are no farmers left there today - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of the send@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 1810 scene of the Oktober@@ fest , was in the 19th century it was still a meadow - and no concrete desert . &quot;
on the other side of Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; in the ancient position , one reads in the area of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , not only the street names &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or from the &quot; &quot; hill &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here on the Au@@ er@@ field road , one once locked people with mad@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in 1858 / 59 , the Munich district @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; was founded &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ders . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den managed the establishment of a psychiat@@ rist , which was brought to King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the chains of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he has prohibited the staff to apply violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ ika . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients first had been space , later it was expanded to 500 seats . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was not enough - the reason for the construction of the county seat in hair in 1905 . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ rist . &quot;
&quot; on the area of former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , you@@ ths now meet young people in the Munich Sal@@ es@@ an@@ um . &quot;
&quot; the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 , and went into a youth house with training . &quot;
&quot; West is located in the football field of TS@@ V Munich east , east residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was established in an architectural re@@ jection to the origin of the Irish Institute , destroyed during the Second World War . &quot;
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was in 1856 as &quot; main square &quot; the department of the department was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot;
&quot; a decisive change brought to the Second World War in the heart of Munich , too . &quot;
&quot; in December 1944 , the Allied bombs broke many holes in the city centre . &quot;
a big stayed until today - on Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English institute , small business houses and a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle from the Middle Ages , once stood on Mari@@ enhof where this day had to work and take place on April 5 , 2017 , for the second S train line . &quot;
&quot; with the shooting singer , the old Munich card can compare with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole in the Mari@@ enhof . &quot;
civil Rights Group publishes travel@@ og@@ ation for Missouri
&quot; the National Association for convey@@ ing Far@@ ming has issued a warning for colored people , which will travel due to discri@@ min@@ ating politics and the rac@@ ist attacks of the state after Missouri . &quot;
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Board for the state of Missouri , which will come into force on August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , as a number of frag@@ mentation , racial @-@ based pen@@ alties in the entire state and indicated here , is in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Missouri , which makes people harder to gain discrimination , as well as the en@@ forcement agencies of the state that aim to release the legal proceedings , the NA@@ AC@@ P said . &quot;
&quot; they have injuries of the civil rights , people will pass . &quot;
&quot; they will be stopped due to their skin color , they will be ro@@ uted or killed , &quot; said the President of the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet .
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA .
&quot; the group quoted inci@@ dents such as r@@ assi@@ sting los@@ ers against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of the year , S@@ anders died under question@@ able conditions at the beginning of the year , after being taken out of the country by the State of Missouri and accused of being accused of having accused of crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also refers to a recently published report by the Office of the General@@ ate @-@ Office of Missouri , in which black motor@@ ists will be more common in the state 75 percent more frequently than white . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and employees inform about what could happen in the Missouri , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people must be willing to bring whether it should bring to the money or relative to the state that they go through the state .
&quot; in 2015 , in 2015 , the FBI reported a total of 100 hate @-@ break , according to the latest figures from the Hass@@ el@@ breaking @-@ report programme of the FBI which not@@ ices the state in terms of number of such injuries on the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to acc@@ use a company for living or employment discrimination .
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had passed travel charges for Texas and Arizona , after the United States adopt en@@ forcement agencies to susp@@ end people for immigration ab@@ uses , which will contribute to the public pro@@ filing of the AC@@ L@@ U . &quot;
&quot; travel charges are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but in recent times , stakeholders have used the measure as reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
the fence project is elementary
the fishing fence @-@ fence project is a success project and will continue in the next year .
the CDU / German Parliament Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac received a picture on the spot .
&quot; during the bur@@ ial of the Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fis@@ her@@ acher CDU was met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ uties . &quot;
&quot; Markus Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann granted the first insight into its operation in which he served 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young birds and houses in five apartments . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Black Forest &quot; is for him the alternative market way for milk of his cows , so s@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; on the table of the cottages , exclusively regional is available . &quot;
&quot; since he is a BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fis@@ bach &apos;s Fis@@ her@@ bach , he called the &quot; elementary project &quot; important . &quot;
I can not generate profit margin on such a steep level .
&quot; the green area for a lot of work , much to be handled with the br@@ ush@@ cutter . &quot;
&quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann emphas@@ ized . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the operation and used this without chemical plant protection and ferti@@ liz@@ ers , even if it does not lead bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the importance of the fence project and is glad about the leaders of the Leader . &quot;
&quot; at a cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
&quot; it is hope that it could be moved out for a while , even for a while . &quot;
&quot; the biggest treasure we have , are people who work in agriculture and make thoughts on how they continue their operation , &quot; the mayor was stressed . &quot;
farmers are often standing in the cr@@ iti@@ que
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
&quot; the open area is thus 40 hectares , which can not be checked up to at least 20@@ 23 . &quot;
&quot; half of the total costs in the amount of 71 500 Euro , half of the leaders of the village was funded by the municipality of Fis@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmer continued to invest 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 km of the fence . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of f@@ ences , &quot; said Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you do not make a real job without farmers and fellow women .
&quot; Peter White , too , stand firm : &quot; here are best food produced here . &quot;
the state @-@ of state @-@ of @-@ Württemberg ( l@@ p@@ r ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state support of wheat f@@ ences .
the objective of the Black Forest .
requirement is the presence of one of the l@@ p@@ r .
&quot; in addition , the covering area should not be more bad ( hang@@ ar over 35 percent ) and must be threatened by the re@@ ap@@ oration . &quot;
&quot; the request of eight participants with 24 plots in 2018 , the request of eight participants , running just under 16 kilometers of fence . &quot;
&quot; the open area is equivalent to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as much as any other - hence the sort of sort by Saddam Hussein &apos;s company in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump @-@ regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heat dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CNN via the proposals of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of bo@@ aters and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ t would have fought him when he had done it .
&quot; but he laid hold on its importance , and in particular the importance that it was attributed to the famous poem by Emma Lazarus , 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base has been added . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty ... a symbol of American freedom which light@@ ens the world . &quot;
&quot; the poem , which you refer , later added later and not part of the original statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; Miller lies properly , but as he &apos;s form@@ ulated it , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary response to the aw@@ aking words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state not only charges any old immig@@ rant , but the trouble of the poor : &quot; your mills , your arms , to breathe freely , and the poor waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ aring waste &quot; was better to see better on our screens .
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he clearly stated that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural con@@ frontation : it is in fact a conflict in the importance of America .
&quot; Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after her death on the basis - did not know that she had a highly political action . &quot;
&quot; the sculpture was to show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ s , showing them in a worn classic picture showing the female em@@ bo@@ diment of freedom . &quot;
Lazarus changed this importance : in her poem the female character is no longer abstract - it has received a voice .
and they themselves have a different name : mother of the ex@@ il@@ ant .
the association &apos;s connection with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American n@@ ati@@ vism .
&quot; and just like Lazarus , the meaning of the statue changed , people wanted to change the right wing of the right wing . &quot;
&quot; the big cry of Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John of the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty arrived , but rather an early neo@@ con@@ serv@@ atives , that the American flame is in the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty continues . &quot;
it should carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch shall not ligh@@ ten the way into the United States .
&quot; rather unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here . &quot;
the meaning of the statue is quite and even a matter of perception of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus existed in it so much as they were seen by the exhau@@ sti@@ ve , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horri@@ fic travels on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
&quot; it is in the true sense , therefore , to see the world from the perspective of human beings , seek refuge and improve a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
&quot; their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome , which they must hear . &quot;
&quot; and this is , of course , not to recognise the perspective of Miller and Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; her tor@@ ch shall not ligh@@ ten the way , but hatred that is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the United Kingdom
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle remembers a time when only two sh@@ all@@ ots belonged to the United Kingdom .
&quot; the power director of athle@@ tics in the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship ader has won a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland something special &quot; and athle@@ tics in the United Kingdom has to learn something from it .
&quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue to continue until we &apos;ll find out , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and you think it has something to do with what they did .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the road corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals @-@ candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ alt@@ - which will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m circuit while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was elected to the team captain . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is quite modest .
&quot; her chapter talk was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a series of athletes , whether they were Scottish , or wherever they live or train , went out of space and felt very motiv@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; the passion and genuine feeling that E@@ ili@@ ie , of course , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Commonwealth Silver medal winner , which will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbelie@@ v@@ ably &quot; that 16 sh@@ all@@ ots in the British team are . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best overall number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which had been reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in the last year , Mu@@ ir carries out five British and two European records last year . &quot;
&quot; it will take part of the 1,500 m and 5,000 m rounds . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another flock that you are looking for a great season , which was the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle remembers her first world championships as the only second Scot@@ sman in the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
&quot; the team @-@ capit@@ als states that she is &quot; enor@@ m@@ ously proud of the fact that many of their country@@ men did not only belong to the team , but in some cases the medals and the fin@@ als are joined . &quot;
&quot; so special about the team capit@@ ol to be in it , that it was voted by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my team mates voted for me and voted me to something completely especially for me , &quot; &quot; she added . &quot;
obviously I am very proud of all the vill@@ i who belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
&quot; and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to rise to poets . &quot;
what is my speech given as chapters ?
&quot; yes , I think it went well . &quot;
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home World Championship .
so it is really important to use this home support and benefit that we are back on the Olympic Stadium .
&quot; I get a second chance to go and compete there , and it will be just like a great atmosphere there . &quot;
blocking of critics on Facebook : do not work for a public office if you do not carry the heating of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers hit him because of all , from the internal politics to his political principles . &quot;
he appe@@ aled to the cr@@ iti@@ que of criticism .
but he didn &apos;t put his critics to silence .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , sil@@ ly and dum@@ b , we become like sheep to battles . &quot;
that brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry H@@ og@@ an who has to work with it more like Washington .
H@@ og@@ ans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on its official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union compl@@ ained him therefore at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the staff of the governor dismissed the law@@ suit as fri@@ v@@ ol , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ action with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is just Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if there is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is amazing . &quot;
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary he@@ itz@@ head .
he has shown a strong hand at the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ fully sent to use Facebook as primary means to join with his voters and make his ha@@ ired head to chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , blocking of persons appearing on the side of the Governor - which is a public forum , which is officially designated as officially and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - un@@ necessarily , and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , H@@ og@@ ans spokesperson Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse gave the actions of the governor and argu@@ ed that the comments of comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; but it is too simple to use the image of controlled or sp@@ ill people , that swe@@ ep the whi@@ p online . &quot;
the post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders , a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no trol@@ ls . &quot;
&quot; they all said , that their comments are respec@@ tful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not benef@@ ited . &quot;
the Bible quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to H@@ og@@ ans &apos;s Catholic faith .
&quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ ass@@ in , but she asked about hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I commented on polit@@ ely that I was disappointed , that there was no response to hate speech and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary area of the message &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea even if a number of people on the same theme takes place , then they will be used by some more than a so @-@ called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; the employees of the governor as &quot; concentrated spam @-@ attack , &quot; would probably call other &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in the past time when you have done the same , that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical guide books and to burn or burn protest@@ ers and to silence . &quot;
but just that happens digit@@ ally .
&quot; H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official , who critic@@ ises Facebook and other social media . &quot;
President Tr@@ ump is compl@@ ained by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question occurred last week in Virginia .
&quot; the chairman of the Board of Super@@ visors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to the U.S. District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they appointed a voters from their Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
it should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time Washington , the time of the affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers beha@@ ved between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous correspondence hit his guidance . &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous trol@@ ls .
&quot; the people that p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ itions that critic@@ ised his position on the contract of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Britain , will overcome his office , according to the historical documents which were collected by the online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he didn &apos;t put them into silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , opinion of opinion and dis@@ courses are the foundation of our nation . &quot;
and true guidance means to accept this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hop@@ ed for domestic comfort in Renaissance Club
&quot; former Europeans n ° 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days of domestic comfort , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
the Nor@@ di@@ re that led the last year next year to the final round in the Arch@@ er@@ field left until he lost against Paul E@@ ales and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he reached his fame with this event , &quot; Raff@@ er@@ ty said . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from his best side , it is in a great condition . &quot;
Jerry made a great job when he placed this place .
he is a jeal@@ ous supporters of this game and is proud of its performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he won in his 32 @-@ year career both at the European Tour as well as at the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; that feels really special , &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I did not defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open since it was in the year after I had won them , taken out of the program . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , to win last year here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary OR@@ R , who came to the European senior tour according to his 50th birthday , returns to the regional floor . &quot;
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more , when you play at home , &quot; OR@@ R said , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to make it well , but you can also feel that additional pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; I &apos;m glad , as far as we went . &quot;
&quot; with the trio on the field , the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major champ@@ ions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark McN@@ ulty . &quot;
&quot; OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six shots on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; admission is free of charge , the parking lot will cost £ 5 per car with a occup@@ ants and £ 10 per car with two or more occup@@ ants . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer due to passive smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , less people have died because of passive smoking of lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; regarding this result , scientists from the University of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) come into a study . &quot;
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking is attributable to passive smoking , &quot; said Department of Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he went up an own study on this subject of 1994 . &quot;
there were more than 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house@@ locks are considered very complex
&quot; the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; reas@@ onably in time , &quot; so the director of the court Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as in the underground lot , which is not noticeable in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which moves on again the construction works , represents a big problem for the components of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignor@@ ance of the drivers in front of red lights and bul@@ lock trem@@ ble is already enormous , &quot; Hein@@ ze reports . &quot;
the road is closed and only the liner buses are eligible to go through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p are busy working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting .
&quot; but fortunately we were provided by our friend Fritz Matt with bol@@ dly mineral water , &quot; says Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
poverty and Death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cook the dinner she doesn &apos;t use stove .
they even rarely used a pot .
&quot; in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ens@@ ity in the quiet Indonesian province of Papua , the house@@ wife normally describes a sweet potato - locally known as &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the knot@@ ted buttons are taken from eag@@ erly , un@@ washed hands and swallowed up . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay Floor - it has no furniture , where they also carry out their daily work , e.g. dresses with d@@ ull water from the nearby S@@ ump . &quot;
a bucket in a homeless room is used as lat@@ rine .
the youngest of the four wives of her husband were assigned no fields .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , it can be too dangerous to work : most village men are unemployed , and many drink it , and there is the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody wants to get around after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare view into the daily life in the high@@ land of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders had to vote in front of the occupying troops . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which touched for independence against the Dutch rule , turned back quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , who maintains the control of the region and foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , with an independent part of Papua New Guinea &apos;s eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is located as remote as it is desert . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then another 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there are no public transportation .
&quot; the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ boo f@@ ences , and made from corrugated houses , which were converted by rust in various yellow tones . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indonesian have made here their trip , since journalists and practically no fore@@ igner . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans sent a god of U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to carry these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and suggests to their vibrant , handmade Tur@@ ban , their dark shirts and their brigh@@ tly rock . &quot;
&quot; earlier , we only had sheets on our body . &quot;
&quot; Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s golden land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine of the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land provinces in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort was min@@ ed in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Papua New York Resource is valued at an estimated $ 78 billion . &quot;
&quot; however , this wealth is a source of affliction to Papua New Guinea that make sure that Indonesia &apos;s most powerful military preser@@ ves the presence of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; an investigation from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort had paid local military operations and units between 1998 and 2004 , almost 20 million US dollars , among them up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
pap@@ u@@ anian claims after greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden g@@ ans and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 in Papua have been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped by the Indonesian military since 1969 , tortured and imprisoned . &quot;
&quot; mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as tribe in the 1970 @-@ 1970s were committed to commit genocide , according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission . &quot;
in the region the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators in the past year alone .
&quot; we will draw everything , &quot; says in a report from the arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Brisbane from 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities in the previous year are included , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electrical charges are particularly popular after another report - and brutal precipitation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week inci@@ dents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; bolts intensi@@ fied , since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants is a population of 83 % of Christian , but demo@@ graphic development is changing , as Muslim economies of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sumatra and Sul@@ awes@@ i come . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ins sell roasted chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , served a mixed vegetables with pean@@ ut sauce . &quot;
local people strug@@ gled for here to join here .
&quot; the migrants started to sell h@@ ens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than local Papua New Guinea , A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai natives , who entered the capital city of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has cost the native Papua New Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Papua New Market . &quot;
&quot; the Indonesian president Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the crowds and as Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke during his election campaign in 2014 , the ine@@ qualities and the rights ab@@ uses in Papua . &quot;
&quot; the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the total of 29 districts of Papua including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Papua too little has changed , and today the loc@@ als feel betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with anticip@@ ation that he will fulfil our hopes that righteousness is restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is initi@@ ation in October . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two indones@@ ian soldiers broke out on a motorbike through the darkness . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took a violation of her clay , and later came back to four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk drunk , beat the group with their ri@@ fl@@ es , told victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers mo@@ wed into the group &apos;s group .
&quot; a child , the 16 year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard defeated that he fell into coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and the things es@@ al@@ ed the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Papua New Guinea , women and children gathered at a football field before the local police station and the military command@@ o centre to demand justice . &quot;
they wore dist@@ al hunting ar@@ ches and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance in the circle and led to a bir@@ ding of bird - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ Stamm .
some demonstr@@ ators started dra@@ g@@ ging stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood has been heated , the soldiers sent a command about an internal radio : &quot; if the masses have more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TIM@@ E that has not been released in local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the director of the K@@ ego K@@ oto &apos;s neighborhood of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the imp@@ ending danger and called for peace and asked the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned , I suddenly shot down in my left wr@@ ist , &quot; &quot; he said TIM@@ E on the porch of his colourful wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still does not know who has fired , but says that the ball came out from the ranks of the here assembled soldiers . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , his cousin , the witness of enlighten@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and supp@@ ressed his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who has only one name , the TIM@@ E said in a dark mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him .
&quot; the Chief Inspec@@ tor of the Papua @-@ police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , rep@@ orters that his officers wanted to secure their station only &quot; because they are attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people are threatening to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young protest@@ ers were killed and many more injured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings came only on &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta in the following day .
&quot; three weeks of Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he was ou@@ sted and sul@@ try to go to the families of the victims of the victims of the victims of the victims . &quot;
&quot; I would like to be solved immediately that this case will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Wir@@ anto Security Minister said that he set out a foreign mechanism for the laying of historical human rights ab@@ uses . &quot;
but the talk began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred before long periods .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and early 2000 years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must be run through , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then , Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke to Jak@@ arta at the 5th of June in Jak@@ arta with TIM@@ E , and said he had no plans in Papua setting a complaint mechanism . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is legally regulated , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wir@@ anto was accused of accused of crimes against humanity by the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses have already been added in Papua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took advantage of such claims with anti @-@ off@@ ences .
&quot; I was interviewed in the last three years but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot dead . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
&quot; he says that he was beaten by the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims . &quot;
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; says he . &quot;
the shooting gallery did not have stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a con@@ frontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a un@@ conscious man to the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , was drow@@ ned when he was f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the road to the hospital . &quot;
newly @-@ controlled vill@@ agers protest@@ ers in front of the company &apos;s site .
the police said that the vill@@ agers stones attacked officers to mo@@ wed them that re@@ acted to warning shots .
but natives say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we &apos;re afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witness , as the last one has been delivered quickly , the TIM@@ E . &quot;
&quot; I have hidden two days in my house , &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called for this to withdraw the officers of the officers and to withdraw the mobile Brigade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an unknown stove for the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of sensu@@ al development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tribe of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ land of Papua . &quot;
&quot; many of the &quot; Free Papua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of Papua attacks , attacks spor@@ adic attacks and kidn@@ apping of Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
some of the top @-@ ups leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
&quot; in response to the last few years thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai and are arbitr@@ arily taken in custody , under the pre@@ text of the &quot; securing of national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some of them never appear again .
&quot; among the people in Papua Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a tragic , forgotten site . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is expensive for loc@@ als . &quot;
bread is just as possible .
people here build everything they eat : especially emergency and fruits and leaf@@ y vegetables .
&quot; agriculture is the task of women , which can work four or five fields of sweet potatoes . &quot;
they keep the most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a were only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Papua and the new migrants , which has arrived in larger number since its opening to the Nab@@ ire airport . &quot;
&quot; the few jobs that exist in the region , usually come to the better educated and wealthy . &quot;
Papua New rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own company competitive .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for here there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribe of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation is the eyes of the world far away from Papua .
&quot; moreover , restrictions on coverage international media are ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although the rare permission was given to films . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is election campaign , to raise restrictions on coverage to promote transparency and development . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists , trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ quiet eastern provinces of Papua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa extension and a black list , &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure remains limited to the Indonesian government to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six p@@ aci@@ fic States - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ Islands and the Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council , to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua including the pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically been supporting the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir rejected the accus@@ ations from the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to extingu@@ ish the evidence of human rights fail@@ ures . &quot;
people who want to know more foreign governments to know this .
&quot; as a official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right @-@ ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but anonymous stay . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia , 2019 , has another presidential election , but the Papua say they will probably not be able to agree again for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good int@@ entions , but it is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai cord , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the family council . &quot;
&quot; it wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from which it lives under the permanent threat of a military military , is in arm@@ sel@@ ess accessibility and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , have to consider her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt that he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they want only righteousness , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and in@@ ti@@ fications of the families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai pl@@ uss@@ ed , a last symbolic act of Des@@ p@@ ite has been buried : the bodies of a victim was buried on a ground opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they might never be dest@@ itute of justice , but at least they don &apos;t let the persons responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us says with his head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos;s sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire was found in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai in Dubai , and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from 337 meters high , 79 @-@ storey buildings . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that swe@@ eps in just two years by the high @-@ house , which is named by the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building became evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we are standing with the fire alarm , and at the scre@@ am of the people . &quot;
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor to the bottom , &quot; told a inhabitants whose name was George Jud@@ ab , Reuters . &quot;
Dub@@ ais civilian authorities told that the units of the fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 local time ( 00@@ .00 Uhr ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building cooled .
&quot; the government said , I work on the provision of accommodations for those affected . &quot;
&quot; the incident can be used on safety of materials that are used in outer areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world , revi@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; an investigation into the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damages caused by the covering , outside covering for decoration or isolation . &quot;
&quot; in the UK , the police , she said that the system of plates to insulation and disgu@@ ise at the London Gren@@ fell tower in June to the rapid spread of a fire that could have died , at which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ Five
the President of the International tennis campus ( IT@@ F ) has fallen by his large Davis Cup cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis @-@ Cup single was not only supported on two winning sets , but also supports the two @-@ third majority by the required two @-@ third majority . &quot;
&quot; although it is often very long , but also very estimated five @-@ sentence classi@@ cs stay on the traditional rate . &quot;
&quot; so , 6@@ 3,@@ 54 percent of member countries voted for reform , the objective of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , was therefore only scar@@ c@@ ely missing . &quot;
we respect this decision but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this iconic and historical competitions . &quot; Hag@@ ger@@ ty said .
one will continue to work with the compet@@ itor .
&quot; not only for the vote , after many in@@ consisten@@ cies before the proposal had come to un@@ cover the final on a neutral place . &quot;
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host @-@ right next year in the following round .
&quot; to reduce the costs for the organis@@ ers , the requirements for training places will be reli@@ eved , etc . players will have to complete the requirements in front of the Davis Cup less official media events . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 of 5 passengers , prohibited items into a plane , finds out a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted with air passengers revealed that more than 20 per cent consci@@ ously sought or un@@ consci@@ ously forbidden objects to the control points of U.S. Transportation Security Administration . they had at least 6 percent , which included the plane while they acci@@ dentally carried out knives or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed they had been delayed , they would be delayed by fire@@ arms , amm@@ un@@ ition or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey carried out more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a Jet @-@ Char@@ ter@@ service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also noted that younger trav@@ ellers should rather mis@@ use the rules . &quot;
&quot; those surveyed by those surveyed admitted that they were wis@@ ely tried to fly with something that were banned by T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were . &quot;
the most common items that were intenti@@ onal by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
&quot; more than 3 percent reported to have carried out objects carried by security control by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male surveyed have confirmed that it deliberately forbidden drugs to the plane . &quot;
&quot; the company said , I asked trav@@ ellers in the whole country to find out how many acci@@ dentally s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling through the airport safety and had done so much . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that people who were most mu@@ g@@ gling s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling - s@@ wis@@ ely or un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly - through safety , those who were most often flying . &quot;
&quot; however , the company shows that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often uns@@ afe that any fluids may take them or how much of them .
so there is no surprise that the largest amount of conf@@ is@@ cated items in T@@ SA conf@@ is@@ cated items prohibited .
&quot; for a time , people thought that T@@ SA could view books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware . &quot;
&quot; liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
electric @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k will love with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; so far , he has so far under@@ lined that a part of the clients have already withdrawn their un@@ oblig@@ atory reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the always tri@@ p@@ umped figures on net sales and even more huge targets , Tesla boss El@@ on Mus@@ k has betra@@ yed another , less glorious number : the cancellation Policy after the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k often advert@@ ised the new car with the more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car . &quot;
&quot; now , Mus@@ k dreamed : from a total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn . &quot;
critics have always been pointed out that there is merely no oblig@@ atory reservations .
&quot; when canc@@ elation , Tesla was paying the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; Reser@@ vation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations must be found , admitted Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the cancellation of some twelve percent of all orders could be solved yet , the Tesla boss does not believe . &quot;
&quot; its argument : the challenge for the ambitious growth target is not in demand , but on the production site . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tesla delivered 8@@ 4.000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models were to be combined - 500,000 will be one million by 2020 . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , there are 1,800 reservations per day . &quot;
&quot; who today &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; may be ordered at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla creates it , its brand new , never even in practice tested production lines without a larger interru@@ ptions with maximum load capacity . &quot;
many experts doubts that this is possible .
&quot; however , it comes to bigger del@@ ays , then the in@@ tox@@ icity could become a problem for Tesla . &quot;
&quot; then the company can &apos;t hin@@ der clients , in dro@@ ves , in dro@@ ves . &quot;
EPA CEO P@@ ru@@ itt with@@ draws the rules of Obama Er@@ a &apos;s policy for reducing emissions
&quot; one day after he had been lam@@ ented by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , had to delay his former decision to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollut@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , as his agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities in relation to re@@ ac@@ tion@@ ate faster than previous administr@@ ations . &quot;
he did not notice the complaint against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal .
&quot; it is about a deadline , which ran on 1 October for states to keep the standards from 2015 for the bott@@ om@@ less o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he will make compliance with a year in order to give more time to study his authority , to study the plan and to hin@@ der economic growth in local decisions or economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump Heads of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponent of stren@@ uous environmental protection regulations . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly occurred to block regul@@ ations or delay the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden change of Wednesday is the most recent legal withdrawal for the P@@ ru@@ ster regulatory Roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA transactions executed its authority when he tried to implement the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas company for monitoring and reducing me@@ than@@ le@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; in a review published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his turn@@ around at o@@ zone standards simply dropped the read@@ iness of EPA for cooperation with the complex process of tim@@ ely fulfilling the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA often did not comply with the dead@@ lines and then maintained for implementation of activists and others , and in an agreement the deadline for execution , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in a regulation by jurisdiction , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also accept the law and authority , which gives us seriously . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA stated that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; desire for delay and all other legally binding . &quot; to ensure that the rules are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Congress leads to a more comprehensive re@@ constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
&quot; in the final month of the draft bill , the implementation of the 2015 rules will be delayed by at least eight years . &quot;
the measure was not yet ready for the vote in the Senate .
&quot; the New York Secretary @-@ General , Eric Cut@@ ting man , who led the United States &apos;s coalition who had pro@@ claim the EPA in this week , said the Group stated the statutory pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important profit for health and safety of these 6,7 million new Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly in@@ hib@@ ited directly from the Smo@@ g , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot;
&quot; in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , Io@@ wa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;

rescue and preser@@ vation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors to their concerns .
&quot; Walter Mart@@ ini emphas@@ ises : &quot; it is a unique treasure . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ her@@ elle has been mentioned for the first time in the Württem@@ bür@@ g@@ ischer Rundfunk for the first time &quot; &quot; Count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with it on the Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard of Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the certificate , according to the certificate , the parish church was also a wonderful farm , to which the church or the patron was right and not vice versa . &quot;
so people lived there .
&quot; as from the description of the National Office of Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 1858 , it was just beside the Lower village and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible in the outskirts of Tum@@ lingen today , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the magnificent settlements of the village . &quot;
old maps from the period around 1600 are under@@ lined by this historical awareness .
the Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ Law was created from the early medieval egg @-@ ear@@ ns .
&quot; a Lord , who built a church , dug and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this suit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; thus , the right to use a priest or a bishop to propose a new priest . &quot;
three alt@@ ars were in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two crushed Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell crashed in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later during the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows spro@@ ckets were stolen and the bells were stolen .
the roof was un@@ den@@ sely .
in 1796 French troops entered the church near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and the church chair and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened 1809 .
&quot; until 1869 , the Tum@@ my Hil@@ arius Cem@@ etery served as the last resting place for the dead from hearing s@@ wis@@ s . &quot;
18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demolished .
only the steep@@ le had to be standing .
&quot; in the New Year of 1834 , a storm collapsed the cherry and half collapsed . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demolished . &quot;
&quot; only today , the Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g was still preserved as a witness to the 750 year old church history . &quot;

club wants to check the permission of wind turbines
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim saw no legal pre@@ condition for the construction , and has therefore turned aside to the council . &quot;
&quot; the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; is denied &quot; &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CDU ) urged to re@@ take its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal .
&quot; the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval of December 30 , 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette didn &apos;t have any wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in quad@@ rants only a wind force concentration zone exists . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind energy systems are generally possible , at the same time the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones are to prevent a &quot; dist@@ ortion &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the town of Vier@@ sen had decided a few days earlier by a change in the area plan to a second wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - which was not approved by the Düsseldorf government , because of a form@@ ul@@ cer . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the appropriate approval statement is still un@@ lawful and therefore rec@@ eding , &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
current state of things : the city council again decided before the summer break again the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette decided ; a approval of the district government is still standing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the issu@@ ance of an approval for the construction of wind energy systems are excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the request .
&quot; the appropriate letter has been received since the last week in the district Vier@@ sen , &quot; said a speaker . &quot;
&quot; on the occasion , the circle takes them again to test the matter again . &quot;
but they expect not to carry out that the process is stopped .
&quot; with a view on current procedure in the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle would not want to express itself in content with the arguments of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW , a new subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build a surface at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette for the construction of four each 200 meters high wind turbines . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company , which was involved in the town of Vier@@ sen , had already been involved with the owners of approximately 65 hectares of large SUV . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind energy systems , electricity needs to meet from around 11 400 households , which corresponds to approximately one @-@ fifth of all four @-@ four households . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros . &quot;
&quot; in the past summer , Four@@ s@@ ens Stad@@ el@@ ens gave green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor together : woman dies with terrible accident
&quot; on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock , there is a terrible traffic accident on the L 333 between low @-@ gel@@ ding and bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis district ) . &quot;
a woman was wounded in a fatal accident .
two more people were injured .
the state road was closed over hours .
&quot; according to police figures , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch carried out with her passenger car as part of the accompanying vehicle with its 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as an esc@@ ort the L 333 in the direction of Bo@@ gel . &quot;
city and distributor plan &quot; home shopping &quot; -@@ weekend
bath Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region should discover the shops in the city centre in September .
the business association and the city authorities want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to attract the inhabitants for shopping spre@@ e .
&quot; as the chairman of the Trade Union , Christian König , announced , the &quot; native Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; &quot; weekend should be sensitive to the customers that offers their own city off the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; hence , a market with regional providers are planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , native companies will present themselves with their training positions . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city center should invite the &quot; mit@@ ter@@ night shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
do not only accept the residents of the city and the nearest region .
&quot; in preparation , advertising spots on the radio , a internet video and printed bags that point out to the active weekend , Christian König . &quot;
city administration and business association co @-@ operate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; thus , the commercial club and the city goes to an additional stage of the &quot; &quot; Attra@@ ctive city centre &quot; project . &quot;
&quot; these include new offers , such as the first &quot; Active day &quot; to Brun@@ nen@@ fest , with sold @-@ out Sunday , talks with all business operators and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot;
attractive offers for Saturday and the closing of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
customer potential should also be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened .
these include courses and tourists .
but many natives have lost the inner city center as a view from the view .
&quot; at the end , all of them do contribute to besie@@ ge the city center - up to land@@ lords , the factories all the city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; it sailed with a network to overcome the le@@ th@@ arg@@ y , which made part of it , had said King in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit Stre@@ ich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Mühl@@ hausen , presented itself to participate in the nationwide third &quot; home shopping &quot; -@@ day , for the first time five Thuring@@ ian cities . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ da@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Bl@@ eich@@ er@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day should be &quot; stronger &quot; for the appreciation of local trade and its importance for the common practice of our cities , &quot;
&quot; the action under the leadership of the I@@ HK and with many partners also make clear that every citizen can be able to influence his direct environment itself . &quot;

Tr@@ ump replaced the tran@@ scription of telephone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription of telephone call between U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump and Dri@@ vers from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January Tr@@ ump requested a telephone at the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , to say , publicly that he would not pay for a planned wall . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. president appe@@ aled him , because he den@@ ounced the wall publicly . according to report he said to him , &quot; &quot; This is the press you can &apos;t say . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump started its presidential campaign with the promise to establish a wall in the southern border of the USA , and s@@ ware , Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first An@@ ru@@ fs with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull have also been published and revealed a ten@@ se sharing .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. gy@@ ms that a trade for the USA , who immig@@ rated to Australia , was ridicul@@ ous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; if he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had said Mr. Lev@@ in , &quot; This is the most pleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury passed by a group of spectators in the rural Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Moore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white rider , a group of white men went forth to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the M@@ obs - a man @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous suit - took a long train at his cig@@ ar and looking through the wind@@ shield .
inside the occup@@ ants moved in fear .
&quot; we want this n -@@ --- r Roger ! &quot; ro@@ aring the man .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; the silence , as a young black man was dist@@ orted by the passenger seat . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , this terrible scene was played on July 22 , only a reproduction . &quot;
&quot; but when a snare around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; is cast out , almost all of the audience hit very real epidemic . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , citizen &apos;s rights to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night , in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Mae Murray Dor@@ sey - from the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one was accused of having been indicted for murder .
&quot; it is truly unbe@@ atable that in all these years no one person was arrested - even though we know they are in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who helps with the organisation . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ voy of the state of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil law@@ suit .
&quot; for him , it serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want pro@@ secutions , we want to be , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive righteousness , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot get healing and reconciliation , until we receive righteousness . &quot;
&quot; a legal department has a towel about the dead body of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ x on July 27 , 1946 . &quot;
&quot; according to the FBI agents , who received from N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding coun@@ ties have been suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but none of them were accused .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects has been on free feet for decades , Citi@@ zenship say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch @-@ actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice adopted the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to give their voice in the summer battle . &quot;
&quot; about the same time as the choice st@@ oned according to the FBI , the black Far@@ mp@@ ter Roger Mal@@ com a white basic owner , Bar@@ nice H@@ ester , during a battle - supposedly because of a woman . &quot;
&quot; Bro@@ oks said , the rum@@ our of the city was that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby brought them , not from her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner paid $ 600 , paid tribute to Mal@@ com from prison so the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cousin Mae Murray and George Dor@@ sey to jail .
&quot; but when she drew near the prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge drew near , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b turned around . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison , who prepared the kill@@ ings and ordered them , includes a FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local pro@@ secutions who had not only been involved in killing , evidence and identity of witnesses . &quot;
Bro@@ oks form@@ ulates it even more fun .
&quot; it was a great massacre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed , to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you vote , and if you vote , you will happen here . &quot;
&quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual presentation of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is descri@@ p@@ tive , att@@ acking , and is justified in a kind of profound rac@@ ism , many believed that he does not exist in America anymore . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to look , and look more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ chen , because we then confron@@ ted all things in us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or not want to hear what I had through . &quot;
&quot; rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest black - in a room and l@@ ur@@ ted , when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ held overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
&quot; he has played the role of the boss C@@ lan@@ mit@@ re for years , but he said that the role would never become easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story alive , because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand of the room , actor Dar@@ ri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nice H@@ ester play their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester crying and pushed him angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he w@@ asted away from my own possession ! &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a invented the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actor ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the loud .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; Ras@@ con@@ a asked . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , I said Gre@@ ene , still cool . &quot;
I just don &apos;t think that white people at that time &apos; n --- he said &apos; .
&quot; but , &quot; &quot; wit@@ ch , one of the other black actors . &quot;
&quot; you just have to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot;
&quot; and precisely there is the energy in space , a feeling of camera ship replaces the un@@ eas@@ iness . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy with this , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene begins once again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ con@@ a says the N word , it says sharp and with re@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repet@@ ition ends un@@ violent and fast .
&quot; there are scre@@ ams , shots and then st@@ illness . &quot;
&quot; a woman , clothed with a funeral dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of actor and brings low cost Holidays , &quot; Strange Fru@@ it &quot; . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks in every second word .
&quot; about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators and tears came out of eyes . &quot;
the audience is divided between black and white .
&quot; a pair of I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many come down only the road . &quot;
they have experienced all almost eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as de@@ hydr@@ ating moisture if Bro@@ oks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bst@@ ones of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; until this point , the mor@@ de remained a an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now if one found on the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels donated . &quot;
&quot; if the last notes of songs sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the amount to get closer and the body &apos;s body . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ wl on their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ ur a little boy when he wants to remember . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene ow@@ es the amount - and suddenly it is over . &quot;
the actor throw away the Lyn@@ x rope and wi@@ pe her tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w im@@ pover@@ ished Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who has played the C@@ lan@@ ders . &quot;
Nick Ras@@ con@@ a embra@@ ced two of his players and then breaks down in her arms so the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; whis@@ pers one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this out of a reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience with the actors joined together . &quot;
&quot; at a table , a white pair of Atlanta excited about the reproduction with a black pair that she has just met . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ sky fought therefore to find words , which feeling the performance left . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to hear this terrible words and deeds ... from people coming from people who look like yourself and that do what they look like , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what really does with me , letting me believe that the Lyn@@ chen still goes on , &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; today is called the only police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks Hof keeps on his table , he eats and reminds of the citizenship rights . &quot;
he said he already started to plan the performance next year .
&quot; the reproduction is inspir@@ ational , because it describes the horror of what we bear , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we learn nothing , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; who does not study his own story , who does not know his own story , is convicted to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ us@@ k &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ reuth
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monum@@ ental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf has reli@@ es on a colourful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous st@@ aging of gigantic , six @-@ story scenes . &quot;
&quot; the shooting stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) , a &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ se &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange will be found in Berlin , an &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ se &quot; logo . &quot;
&quot; before that , an open Mercedes @-@ old@@ timer , in which the Rhine river was pos@@ ited as rock@@ ers , or alternatively a Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; rec@@ ap@@ tured oil subjects at Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power , and gre@@ ed - that attracts attention through his &quot; ring &quot; production . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhein@@ gold language - sung by Stephanie H@@ out@@ ze@@ el , Wie@@ b@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra Steiner - just like in &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; . &quot;
&quot; she ob@@ sol@@ ete Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , mur@@ m@@ ur in Hollywood Man@@ ier and give the stuff into the trunk and give the Kra@@ w@@ allo @-@ Cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the glorious in Hagen which surro@@ unds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weight box .
brutal the scene when he defe@@ ats Siegfried .
&quot; later , Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) must believe in your turn . &quot;
the audience ow@@ es its ensemble with powerful appl@@ ause .
&quot; Foster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are celebrated , who was modest and le@@ aning his hands on the Merkel @-@ noise . &quot;
great appl@@ ause for the Festival Orchestra that shows the first time on stage - in view of the large heat again in le@@ thal leisure clothing .
the performance was expected by Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ ete@@ am .
&quot; in 2013 he had to leave a g@@ ell@@ ent pipe concert in 2013 , there were five years later , in which the ten &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; was under@@ going . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ haus Katharina Wagner is likely to have a look forward .
&quot; it is noted that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in certain ways , &quot; she had said briefly before the show of d@@ pa . &quot;
the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf but it was also an understanding of whose visibility grew .
I prefer a positive result .
Max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in their volunteers year on several sites .
where anywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually at Stein@@ furt in the furniture exchange , once a week I can help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I have already worked in the open all day at school .
how are your experiences with that ?
&quot; quantity : it &apos;s a beautiful , broad spectrum I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; you are 26 years now , so is a late @-@ employed volunteer . &quot;
how does it come ?
quantity : I have made high school .
&quot; and then a construction engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; for me , I recognized that it &apos;s wrong for me and I want to do something else to work with people . &quot;
and then I asked what you do .
&quot; a social year , there is a look , there you can see how it is on the spot , in the focal point , perhaps , really is . &quot;
and was it like that ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter semester .
&quot; I will study dual @-@ study , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and studying a social worker and study at Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences . &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
&quot; it will always be , where you make the FS@@ J . &quot;
you can make it from the age of age to youth - in all possible Fac@@ ets of social work .
&quot; with me , it was very varied . &quot;
&quot; I was partly in the oo@@ gs , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
&quot; for me , it was just the right thing that has irrit@@ ated me . &quot;
I could recognize and see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
unlike in civil engineering ?
&quot; lots : well , sure , here it is not about to calculate stati@@ cs . &quot;
&quot; it always has other human beings , each with another story behind him . &quot;
whether a refugee is whether a youth who has been picked up out of the family - you have to go individually .
very interesting .
and they had no touch of contact ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy .
there is a range that gives a lot .
&quot; much love , lots of kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but so that &apos;s life . &quot;

the con@@ voy of Kabul : NATO soldier killed in suicide attacks
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber has attacked a military con@@ voy of the Afghan capital Kabul , a soldier of NATO and injured several others . &quot;
&quot; five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter have been hurt , a declaration of NATO . &quot;
&quot; un@@ confirmed local reports , according to the incident in the district Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , three civilians died . &quot;
&quot; the bombing is the last violence that hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul . &quot;
&quot; in a statement by NATO , the explosion occurred on Thursday night when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explo@@ sives &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the statement is said that all the injured in a stable state are in a stable state , and in the U.S. military hospital at the air@@ field of Bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram . &quot;

&quot; violence under@@ lines the pre@@ dict@@ ory security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. forces to support military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and particularly in the call of President Ash@@ raf Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns Dec@@ ision to Del@@ ay The Smo@@ g Rule to Kl@@ agen
&quot; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has taken a decision to delay an regulation of Obama &apos;s government , repe@@ aled what the states are obliged to cur@@ b the smoke caused by smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 states accused the agency for the def@@ endants . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to dis@@ assemble the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ des 2015 , &quot; and said they show the commitment of the agency to cooperate with States . &quot;
&quot; we believe in the dialogue with and to remember that we react to our state partner , &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA announced in June , to determine the o@@ zone provisions in which in a part of the country &apos;s pollut@@ ant emissions are to determine where cuts are made to stri@@ ve more str@@ ingent air quality standards - to be delayed until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed an action on Tuesday , and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to resur@@ rec@@ t a wide range of environmental impact , which is imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a wider agenda , which is to boost economic growth according to tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; however , the efforts have caused the set@@ back of the democr@@ ats and nature groups that make worry about the effects of larger emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA website says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the lung function &quot; and can strengthen respiratory symptoms such as asthma . &quot;
Communal Living Area wants to community
&quot; at the end , the decision was clear : at two opponents , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ ners conclu@@ des the establishment of a common room in the future living room . &quot;
&quot; prior to discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing basic part is signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; indeed , it will take to last until the end of the church community belonged to the municipal property , but there is now no planning stage for the project over a private investor project . &quot;
there is a discussion relating to a common room .
&quot; one of the two investors who are still in the boat , offered to meet the church . &quot;
on the ground floor it would provide a living space - about 55 square metres - and a ad@@ joining terrace with a total price of 70 square meters is available for a special price .
&quot; the administration and the majority of the council is floating before , such a common room not just to see for the residents of sen@@ i@@ or@@ ly living , but open to the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word from &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ cafe &quot; made the round . &quot;
&quot; the decision , which was decided by the provision of funding for the current household in the last autumn , will be reconc@@ iled to the provision of funding . &quot;
the building is located in the rehabilitation area .
&quot; the establishment of a common room would be , as reported T@@ j@@ aden , capable of generating 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the decision is looking forward to sign@@ alize the investor , that in this respect , there is no tu@@ bing between the legs , the conclusion that both the saddle - what the tr@@ ash @-@ height reduces and the construction of economic power - were possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , this addition . &quot;
if it helps : unanimously he will happen to the body .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela call extension refers to the many of his own buildings , with which one would not move forward to the common room from the window , she says , &quot; &quot; I do so hard to do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ vonne handed herself absolutely to the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it sees behind a covered sub@@ sid@@ y on either property or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , because with the purchase of the surface man you don &apos;t give a chance , but also receive a real , in doubt , the counter@@ attack is the counter . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ers proposal , in order to apply accordingly , finds three fears . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it remains with two opposition votes to the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ ises : &quot; if we draw the decision , we make a huge step away to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;

to wan@@ der in the Har@@ z of Stern
&quot; in the resin , the nationwide first &quot; star@@ row path &quot; will be created . &quot;
this is the idea of the association Ob@@ servatory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; an &quot; star trail &quot; come to meet the information needs of many har@@ vest@@ ers , was called it . &quot;
&quot; he offers free nature , science , movement and sporty performance . &quot;
the members want to move along the planned route boards and inform about stars and stars .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the club plans &quot; well @-@ reaching installations to five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; en@@ qu@@ ire of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ er , Hoh@@ enz@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber . &quot;
the information on the tables are to be completed via the Internet .
&quot; for this reason , a good mobile network reception plays an important role in the site selection . &quot;
accessibility is a crit@@ eri@@ on .
&quot; later , the star Train is supposed to be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star@@ path , the viewer experienced a lot of knowledge worth knowing about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the club . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned why stars could have different colors , or why a star stronger than another , although it is much further away . &quot;
&quot; also , in which constellation can find a selected star and when he &apos;s best to see . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , the association has been operating the highest point ob@@ servatory in Northern Germany since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation , Har@@ z is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ me@@ da galaxy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
&quot; in the Uni @-@ Stadt , there have been a little resem@@ bl@@ ance to the initiative of the planet@@ arium Göttingen since 2003 , such as the planned stars - the planet path . &quot;
&quot; starting in front of a hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet leads up to the Hain@@ berg and ob@@ servatory , as well as a &quot; alien &quot; location in Di@@ emar@@ den ( Municip@@ ality of Equ@@ al ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
&quot; the poles with the individual planets , including the d@@ warf plan@@ ed Plu@@ to at the end point - are precisely positioned at the distance and scale of one to two billion . &quot;
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks this way to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun measures exactly 70 meters away . &quot;
the total distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
&quot; while the light of Sun up to Plu@@ to is about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need an hour to St@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
pede@@ stri@@ ans are faster than the light in the universe .
&quot; the march to the next fixed star , however , would last half a year . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , Mik@@ ey Garcia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down &quot;
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Garcia , who should be in a coll@@ ision course in order to stage the most exciting boxing battle in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN @-@ offices in Los Angeles , until Garcia , the un@@ protected World Bo@@ xing Council Ligh@@ tweight Champion , went down to Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organization Super @-@ fe@@ at champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory by a susp@@ icious decision on the former four @-@ divisions Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List . &quot;
&quot; Garcia stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
&quot; when the pair of photographs were pos@@ ited , Lom@@ ach@@ enko Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters &quot; would be the perfect order of order . &quot;
&quot; I am a former spring @-@ weight , &quot; remin@@ ded Garcia . &quot;
&quot; I went to Bron@@ er &#91; at 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to come to light weight .
and he must move on light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
the fans demand this .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; climate asked whether it should be at Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko is strug@@ gling with a 135 @-@ pound debut in this year to make a date back in the next summer with Garcia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also had an interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell in the Forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this battle could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode because all fans have asked after him , &quot; &quot; Garcia and pushed them open to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
when always they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; he said , he sets Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may also participate in his Saturday struggle . &quot;
&quot; however , Lom@@ ach@@ enko held the generous praise for Garcia and said that he would think out of the battle Champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side , very slowly , I &apos;m sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted to know the Ko @-@ Out . &quot;
&quot; Garcia said , the focus is to show impact strength , then boxing . &quot;
&quot; both said they could feel the moment@@ um , which built up for its own struggle . &quot;
this is the fight that must be performed .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work , &quot; &quot; Garcia . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; I have waited for the top fighters and that is Mik@@ ey .
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four verses after ty@@ re bur@@ ners
&quot; at an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon , four people were seriously injured . &quot;
&quot; after first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost shortly before 16.@@ 30 . shortly before the connection station , market is believed to be control over its vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the car was to@@ wed to the left in the ar@@ mist@@ ice , where he over@@ took and then lie on the roof in the ridge . &quot;
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were seriously injured during the accident .
&quot; during the initial supply of the final through the ambul@@ ance , A7 was imprisoned in the direction north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lane could pass by the accident . &quot;
Fort@@ un@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; turning chain works better &quot;
&quot; Andre Hoffmann is hoping for the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , making the optimization of def@@ en@@ def@@ ensive information in Au@@ e Points . &quot;
&quot; with the first match of the season Andre Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result also , there were not the two opponents at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two opponents to do too much , and we have to watch in Au@@ e even better , &quot; says the def@@ ensive player of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Erz@@ gebirge mountains , the three @-@ chain chain should be further optimized . &quot;
&quot; and a gate after a fre@@ er , do not want to catch up again . &quot;
&quot; for the future , there will be so that nobody else represents Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) onto the line . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his crew , even after the experience in preparation with the turning chain is better , than with the quad@@ ron chain . &quot;
&quot; still I don &apos;t know how we &apos;re going to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Fun@@ kel , but Hoffmann is confident that we just have to build on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann player who can build well &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; requirement is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ ious , and we cannot afford such a lot of errors . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann also travels to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if you can talk after a mis@@ leading start , I don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we can concentrate on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the trop@@ hy , we will certainly speak of a regular season op@@ ener . &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing .
&quot; the start into the season , I first judge after six to eight days of days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Fun@@ kel , who doesn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e , only because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season as a home game , &quot; &quot; says Fun@@ kel and Hoffmann , that players from Au@@ e might have to be something fresh because they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una for an asc@@ ending favorite in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know that 100 @-@ percent where they are currently standing , &quot; says the internal defense of Fort@@ una . &quot;
guests from the Rhineland go to the Rhineland as a lighter favorite on Sunday in the En@@ counter ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; that we throw it away , only because we have the right to come under the first six is stupid , &quot; says Fun@@ kel , whose balance is quite positive with only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga , which one has to beat the out@@ set , explains Fort@@ un@@ as Head coach . &quot;
&quot; such statement would be arro@@ gant and excessive . &quot;
and so Fun@@ kel wants to experience his players on Sunday in no case .
new results of Swedish asylum evaluation tests released
&quot; the latest results of testing for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish Authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( puzzle of puzzles ) has begun with the implementation of tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum process , they should make an exact assessment of the age , after failure to critic@@ ised the Swedish Mig@@ r@@ ational Authority ( Mig@@ r@@ ational Bu@@ et ) because of errors in the assessment of correct age of some refugees . &quot;
&quot; until today , Mig@@ r@@ ations sent 6,@@ 880 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ ty per cent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , whereas in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency evaluated that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , conclusion was that the person could possibly be under 18 years old . &quot;
tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are constant during the past months . &quot;
&quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of last months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases , in which the person has been judged for more than 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has been led over his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the Agency released the results of 5@@ 81 testing and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases that I propose that it was 18 years old or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bl@@ adet published the 5@@ 81 published results , she noted that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical examination assessment , being made in the x @-@ ray data of instructions and MRI images of knee @-@ joints , which will then be analyzed in some areas , even in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ist is the En@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska @-@ Institute , whose work covers the assessment of biological maturity of people to see if they were sooner or later as usually through the pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
&quot; to assess the biological age in this manner , is very uns@@ afe . &quot;
&quot; if we cannot tell it , we should not do it as if we could &quot; , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of getting an adult is in@@ correct . &quot;
&quot; the greatest risk is in this case , if the person is under 18 , this is approximately 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the Plan
the work on the three bridges of Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are going well ahead .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven @-@ tonne of concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern part of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very well in the time , it runs super , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Building Manager at Road Construction and Transport in Government Freiburg Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , works began at the same time in all three renov@@ ating bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the building is scheduled for October , and is sure that the schedule will be stopped . &quot;
&quot; the first bridge , from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
it is a v@@ ault wooden bridge made of concrete covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the two other bridges , she now has come into the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure stability and transport security , the three buildings are thoroughly rehabil@@ itated . &quot;
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
&quot; the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach , on Wednesday morning , has got a 1,@@ 30 metre wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge folder . &quot;
&quot; this is a stra@@ pping , which is used as operation away . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , a 2,@@ 20 m wide bridge board should be used on the southern part of the bridge . &quot;
then the pedestrian walk@@ way should run .
&quot; it is a special thing about manufacturing , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ ab@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented bridge caps .
special finger@@ tips inspired the laying of lines through the work in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a glass fibre cable where many companies are connected .
the residents were informed about the project in advance of work bal@@ lot .
&quot; in addition , fish and cru@@ st@@ ac@@ eans had to be refresh@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; for bridges between the building yard and the collection , in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for construction work on the bridge at Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher &apos;s entrance , the street is located in the area of the &quot; &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; in the area of the bridge . &quot;
the costs for the three bridge rec@@ ali@@ z@@ ations amount to 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ ass@@ in protest with German potato salad
&quot; it does not occur so frequently that parties may move on a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to bring to a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties ( CDU , SPD , Grü@@ ne , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peaceful flag in this day because the Af@@ D is active in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell to the &quot; big election campaign &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and well known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who formed the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are before the event at the beginning of the event , do not want to listen to the African women , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colourful . &quot;
&quot; originally the city pic@@ nic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; is planned at the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but is now taking place on the parking below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the African exhibition in the Stad@@ thalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers .
&quot; what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chairman of the Forum A world and one of the author@@ itative organizers , are pleased : &quot; great , how many people joined here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which could even eat the Af@@ D without any problem , &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police re@@ iter@@ ated many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , and it shows presence especially in the railway station , which is just a few metres from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D really come on Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported by the Af@@ D volcanic erup@@ tion that he has been trying to have such an event and get the supplement .
&quot; the 45 year old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf initially asked in Dau@@ n , but there was not enough parking spaces because of the already constructed Laur@@ ence Church . &quot;
&quot; so the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes are pleased that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
&quot; looking at the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz : &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , main thing , it remains peac@@ efully . &quot;
&quot; this also does : at 20 o &apos;clock the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz is a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle of various speakers , among them the Rhineland @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ic Af@@ D @-@ Chair@@ woman Uwe Young . &quot;
&quot; in the hall , approximately 200 listeners that are waiting to wait for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch keep her words . &quot;
&quot; unchanged is the police force , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; something more than an hour will take the Af@@ D event , the guests on the front have a longer breath , but also here is scheduled for short after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police may fall down - no special inci@@ dents .

both solo@@ ists are winners and pri@@ ze@@ winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in Europe &apos;s top @-@ ranking orchestra .
so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both united the lust , not just to exceed the limits on their instruments but to merge the limits of various gen@@ res . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach on the two as in a new look , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; united with Bulgarian Folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz@@ ech@@ op@@ ener N@@ ils W@@ ish , mix classi@@ cs , jazz and the free games to a fascinating artwork . &quot;
this core of the program was first performed in the spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ icked has been specially written for the two musicians and even more : the Has@@ l@@ acher monastery church with their special acou@@ stics will be aware of the concert .
Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about their bis@@ exual
&quot; some people love grilled cheese , and they will eat it until the end of their life . &quot;
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; so Kri@@ sten Stewart openly openly about their bis@@ exual . &quot;
&quot; when I live in grilled che@@ eses , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood @-@ stars was the &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson who ultimately disp@@ ers@@ ed bitter@@ ly .
&quot; despite all that the brun@@ ette is insured against the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with love , whom I have thought . &quot;
&quot; or do you believe , I have played it ? &quot;
&quot; according to their separation , Kri@@ sten gave her to bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed in du@@ alism . &quot;
so it never has confused or hin@@ dered me .
I did not like it yet to be taken seriously .
&quot; in particular , according to &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; , &quot; but in the school time they preferred like a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
that really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me I would look like a Bu@@ b . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , anxi@@ ous and ashamed . &quot;
&quot; now look back and think to me , &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
especially the public they do not love her love : &quot; people expect you to be a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; and perhaps I call me some more than und@@ ank@@ bar , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the public . &quot;
&quot; governor of West Virginia , announces that he changes the party &quot;
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night at a rally with President Tr@@ ump , that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; if you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Governor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as a population of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you when I &apos;m a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; Justice . &quot;
&quot; as a trainer , I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump spoke previously a great announcement in the West Virginia rally .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump took West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice received not the Democratic Can@@ didate of Hillary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; Justice , which is according to Forbes the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
Forbes states that it has carbon@@ ates in five states and inherited a carbon business from his father .
it is worth $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee gave a statement on Thursday night in which it said : &quot; the party changes of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party which would rather stop us than to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 Gou@@ vern@@ s and control of the least legislative bodies in history is the announcement of Governor Justice to find only the last re@@ jection of a party that is from top to bottom without a guided tour , the R@@ NC @-@ president R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel said in an explanation to the C@@ BS News . &quot;
CO@@ E Pra@@ ise &quot; honest &quot; Russian exc@@ use for D@@ oping scandal
&quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , pra@@ ising on Thursday what he described as an obvious exc@@ use from Russia to a D@@ oping scandal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to come back to the sport again . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics boss Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ actic , said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the athle@@ tics world championships , that the exile of his country was correct and that he decided to fight d@@ oping . &quot;
&quot; he said it was sorry for &quot; all athletes , for competitions of gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; in spite of its comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for maintaining the ban , which was hanged in November 2015 , after a report in the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had been evidence of state @-@ funded D@@ oping in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has experienced during itself , that they have experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; CO@@ E said he is &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; that Russia would accept the criteria for his re@@ introduction . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very con@@ structive day , and I think progress has been achieved , but the Congress also supports the recommendations of Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we need to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the principle of the principle was always , that we wanted to separate the clean athl@@ ete from the withered system , &quot; he added &quot;
&quot; nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world championships , which will begin on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players . &quot;
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia has to meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still in@@ adequate and prohibited train@@ ee are still active , he said rep@@ orters in London according to a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
&quot; funeral in Mali , conf@@ is@@ cop@@ ing in Mali &quot;
&quot; at a funeral service at the nor@@ theastern Fr@@ itz@@ lar , approximately 1,000 people have thought of the soldiers belonging to a helicopter type in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the Dom@@ stadt with high security arrangements .
&quot; to the still uncertain decision , Secretary Minister Ursula , said about the Le@@ yen ( CDU ) . &quot;
they called the two inver@@ ted pilots but as &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of her specialist . &quot;
&quot; we bow before this highest sacrifice , which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; said she . &quot;
&quot; the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Chief of Chief of the Northern H@@ essen were born on Wednesday one week ago in the West African Mali . &quot;
&quot; their customs were transferred to Germany and on Thursday , accompanied by a total guard of the German army in the Fr@@ itz@@ ingen cathedral Sankt Peter . &quot;
&quot; at noon , only the guests took leave in the church . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , the funeral of the family , eng@@ ined friends , began from representatives of the German army , and politics . &quot;
among them also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CDU ) and the general manager of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wie@@ ker .
&quot; deser@@ ted ro@@ ses laid down , and the members stood in the arm with his arm . &quot;
&quot; in front of the church , Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er followed the ceremony on a canvas . &quot;
the Minister of Defence by the Le@@ yen described the revers@@ ed soldiers than &quot; highly decorated &quot; and a sat@@ in .
the sh@@ ale de@@ capit@@ ated Tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar was built in Fr@@ itz@@ lar and had been one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regim@@ ent .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regim@@ ent , among whom the soldiers belong , said : &quot; if this crew could not turn away the crash , there would have been no mo@@ ist . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali showed no doubt about the use of Le@@ yen : the use is dangerous .
&quot; but he is also of high importance &quot; for a country , from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; after the funeral , the S@@ är@@ ge was brought out of the cathedral . &quot;
&quot; when and where to be best@@ ed , the German army made no information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave beside his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , wants to be buried after his death in addition to his wife . &quot;
this divided the Royal House on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for both of them .
&quot; the Queen was agreed with the decision of her husband , he continued his name in the message . &quot;
where Prince Hen@@ rik become buried there is still un@@ clear .
but he did not have the intention to join in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never done a H@@ eh@@ l that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the thr@@ ashing of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would like to be king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he retired and also puts the title &quot; &quot; prin@@ cess@@ es &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hen@@ rik in Denmark do not have the title and the function , which he wanted to see himself against his wife , not as equivalent to death , declared L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , who was the director of the Danish king &apos;s house . &quot;
&quot; the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be un@@ clear , be un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not have the int@@ ent to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he worked for the last 50 years .
&quot; born in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French arist@@ oc@@ racy , Mar@@ gre@@ the had met in London in 1965 . &quot;
he worked in the French embassy .
&quot; during his later wife , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year @-@ old re@@ union with the Dan@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was crit@@ ici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was pregnant , I prefer wine instead of beer , silk bel@@ ong@@ ings instead of stri@@ cken so@@ cks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia Tob@@ acco , who had the reputation to be the brand of social intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope to hope . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants a rapid re @-@ election
CDU and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; defe@@ ats Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority , wants to return to a rapid re @-@ election of the country , but he doesn &apos;t want to return . &quot;
&quot; for the resolution of the Parliament , he said on Friday . &quot;
&quot; previously , the approaching exit of a Green M@@ EPs from their country @-@ citizenship in Lower Saxony had over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a severe crisis . &quot;
five months before the official date of the Sunday election the red @-@ green coalition lost its scar@@ ce A @-@ votes majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the former Green Party of El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jack@@ ed its step with the non @-@ nomin@@ ation for the 2018 election in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; &quot; she said on Friday in Hannover . &quot;
CDU Fra@@ ction : Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ en@@ ler wants to recommend it to his Group to record them .
&quot; the CDU and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Dutch national day , SPD and Green seats . &quot;
&quot; to date , the relationship was revers@@ ed . &quot;
the new Land@@ tag was elected at the 14th January next year .
Th@@ en@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government has to decide whether they could continue in this situation without a majority .
&quot; Stephan Weil holds it to be indispensable , however , that the day of the country decides as fast as its self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CDU faction is expected to decide on Tuesday again on Tuesday .
&quot; the state collection , too , sees the opportunity that the prime minister of the prime minister draws trust and cho@@ oses a successor . &quot;
&quot; our constitution provides several options .
&quot; these possibilities must be examined legally clean , &quot; said Th@@ um@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; you will discuss all the questions in peace , if they are legally checked . &quot;
Th@@ en@@ ler called T@@ ry &apos;s step &quot; but somewhat cur@@ vy . &quot;
the political scientist himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very well . &quot;
they described as a tag of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the ab@@ dic@@ ated member to the return of their country .
&quot; of course , we assume that she has received her country meeting that she has received over the green state list , with immediate effect , &quot; shared the state @-@ president met@@ a Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the Group president of the Green An@@ ja P@@ IEL said : &quot; &quot; we regret the decision by El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets extra@@ ordin@@ arily . &quot;
she deliberately decided to lead no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the Group .
&quot; also in the background that there were no content differences , we cannot pass this step forward . &quot;
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the survi@@ ves of the Lower Saxony &apos;s Green Party El@@ ke T@@ ves to the CDU as betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters and elec@@ tors , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the Bund@@ esch@@ ef of the Socialists on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to restart the country &apos;s country fast .
the outlet T@@ ry costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; in its recent E@@ it@@ el@@ ity and in their fresh@@ ness , the political interests have become their personal interests in their interests of the country , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus of salvation . &quot;
it is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony makes this dirty in@@ filtr@@ ate and tried to beat the political capital .
low @-@ fac@@ tions CDU @-@ Fra@@ ction : Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ en@@ ler wants to recommend his M@@ EPs to include El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets into the CDU .
&quot; the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw the v@@ ests , with personal career thinking the outcome of the 2013 country @-@ election . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the CDU was the strongest force of the SPD , SPD and Green in the country , but a very thin majority . &quot;
&quot; Home Affairs in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ ft@@ ei@@ vers , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discussed about contam@@ inated eggs .
how could the scandal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
agricultural minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network in Germany ( R@@ ND ) and answer .
&quot; Schmidt Schmidt , How does the consumer protect you from pois@@ oned eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumer inside and consumers to check the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp pressure .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal , www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de provide the states most recent information on the eggs bat@@ ches . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if we know what we currently know , health haz@@ ards are practically impossible . &quot;
&quot; now Al@@ di now assumes the best crisis action reaction - all the eggs out of the offer , because the central role of the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance of the Federal Minister is not really perceived ? &quot;
the food monitoring is the task of states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately opened immediately and has been since dis@@ closure of Germany &apos;s affected exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
trade has the same as the manufacturer to worry about that the sold @-@ selling products are end@@ able and health un@@ question@@ able .
&quot; if with eggs of the back level of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are not traffic @-@ capable . &quot;
&quot; un@@ loaded eggs , however , can be sold and consumed . &quot;
this time they are not to blame .
are manufacturing companies and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; after the end of the case , production plants meets immediate debt . &quot;
&quot; rather , they need to calculate with the relevant illegal practices of services with economic damages . &quot;
&quot; as always , there is too little control in the harvest . &quot;
is it missing only on the staff or also on the mu@@ ff@@ ing jurisdiction ?
&quot; however , it was just the official controls which have exposed the process . &quot;
&quot; to the truth , however , food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded from 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a consistent education of such events and the hand@@ over to the state bar in the cases , in which off@@ ences may be present , of crucial importance . &quot;
I have already realized several times that I expected to expect a mosquito problem by the responsible authorities .
is the regular alarm system really needed ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and efficient food .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de in the food industry is used , consumers and consumers are righ@@ tful . &quot;
&quot; due to the handled funding , manufacturers , dealers and consumers come into a situation that absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ ds Fi@@ du@@ il must not be acceptable , and must be terminated immediately . &quot;
&quot; on all levels , this must be consistently and with high pressure . &quot;
&quot; I expect from all relevant authorities , that the atomic fact will be cul@@ tur@@ ally enlighten@@ ed . &quot;
how the financial rules of football on Ne@@ y@@ m@@ ars move to Paris
&quot; the rules that aim to prevent un@@ interrupted spending of European football matches , Ne@@ y@@ m@@ ars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain do not distur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; some consequences are coming to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEFA , as the leading organization that the European game monitors the power , teams from access to the prestigious Champions @-@ League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules , which have been launched by UEFA in 2011 , mean that PS@@ G has to point out , that the transfer from Ne@@ y@@ mar is without great losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid $ 222 million ( 262 million dollars ) to purchase the Brazilian population from its contract , and Ne@@ y@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ m@@ ars move to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make money loose with security so that Ne@@ y@@ mar writes and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy rich ruler of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; associations may turn out a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but must be agreed with legitim@@ ate income sources that allow them to allow the break @-@ even point in her on the football @-@ related business . &quot;
&quot; FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini , following his election to the UEFA president in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; former French player believed that clubs , who had enormous debt in their quest for success , was effectively dec@@ ei@@ ving and ris@@ ky to ru@@ in when banks or owners have returned their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P moved from concentration to the debt of the clubs on the monitoring of their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abr@@ am@@ o@@ vich originally used in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to build the crew and build a global mark - to become a tough@@ er matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P processing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; although Plat@@ ini is fallen by the Presidency in Un@@ g@@ nade , his UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to deter those who deter them from excessive issues . &quot;
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will be able to rein@@ force the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ de@@ so , who is responsible for the UEFA for FF@@ P , compared to The Associated Press in the past week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of Ne@@ y@@ mar in a flat rate , it may distribute the amount for accounting on the duration of his contract . &quot;
Ne@@ y@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract for the next five years in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 launched the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros , and it was arranged for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season to 21 players instead of normal 25 players . &quot;
&quot; UEFA is searching for clubs , who could try to list their financial statements by exp@@ orting their income by companies that are connected to the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a cat@@ ar@@ tic company could develop the PS@@ G if the value of the sponsor@@ ship should not exceed standard market rates , the UEFA would not be considered legitim@@ ate income . &quot;
&quot; this happened in 2014 , when the UEFA decided that the value of the Spon@@ sor@@ ption of the PSA Tourism Authority was blo@@ wn up by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ y@@ mar would come to Qatar for the organis@@ ational committees of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have disputed that Ne@@ y@@ mar World Cup will be eligible for the UEFA Reg@@ ulations authorities and could be simple to find out for the UEFA Reg@@ ulations authorities .
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G means that the UEFA will be more attentive to consider any attempt to deal with the rules . &quot;
the UEFA had no discussions with PS@@ G talking about Ne@@ y@@ m@@ ars transfer to the people who are familiar with the situation .
&quot; they said among the condition of anony@@ m@@ ity with The Associated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
&quot; the latest reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros , with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million . &quot;
the accounts for the last fiscal year must be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects that Ne@@ y@@ m@@ ars arrive a blessing for Spon@@ sor@@ ing @-@ De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot . &quot;
the Association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing the signing .
&quot; the Spanish League was definitely irrit@@ ated , one of the best football player to see and she tried to prevent ne@@ y@@ m@@ ars leaving , claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financed D@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS relating to Kat@@ ars , the official owner of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; Arsenal Manager Arsen@@ e W@@ enger , whose club is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ ons , divi@@ des the reservations of La League against a state that funded an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of owners and this has changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; W@@ enger said on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country owns one club , everything is possible . &quot;
it will be very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play because you can have different ways or have different interests when a country has such great actor to represent a country .
Swiss is searching for a new Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ ants
&quot; in recent years , Chocol@@ ate Fre@@ y board chocolate has produced for the Swiss . &quot;
now the sweet@@ est cooperation is standing in front of a possible end : the airline writes the order .
&quot; on request of the news agency S@@ DA , Swiss spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ p confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; according to recent planning , the airline will close a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would have checked all two to three years and under@@ go a quality control .
&quot; with the current suppliers of Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y , we are very satisfied , &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
&quot; around 17 million small rot@@ ten packed bags of 14 grams , spread per year before landing to the passengers . &quot;
the Swiss does not want to do any information about the costs .
&quot; industry insi@@ der appreci@@ ates the order volume in accordance with &quot; northern Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros daughter achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more import@@ antly the advertising effect : for a Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ f manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
&quot; how many candidates give it to the new call , the Swiss will not want to be betra@@ yed . &quot;
but only Swiss manufacturers come in question .
&quot; according to the newspaper article , Chocol@@ ate Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to make a renewal in the spring of 2018 . &quot;
for S@@ DA the largest Swiss chocolate producer was not achie@@ vable for one statement .
chocolate bars spread the Swiss since 2006 on board of their flights .
&quot; before Swiss had completed a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut is delivered in cooperation with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets . &quot;
&quot; the possibility to place the logo , Swiss started two and a half years with the start of collaboration with Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
&quot; on long distance trips , customers of the first class with treats of the conf@@ ection@@ ery Spr@@ ün@@ gl@@ i p@@ am@@ pered , in the business class n@@ ags passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi von Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
&quot; at short distance , Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi is also distributed by Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and economy class . &quot;

&quot; as a cultural Ar@@ te@@ f@@ act , it is equally a par@@ ody and a em@@ bo@@ diment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era . &quot;
&quot; but as fran@@ chise , it feels like that time . &quot;

&quot; the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ ak ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) still not forgotten . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still has not lost its vir@@ ility .
&quot; and there is another crazy @-@ mal@@ icious Plot , in the Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Sho@@ ste@@ ward ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
&quot; as always , the courses of the best part of the fran@@ chise are . &quot;
&quot; it is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d to see the Matt D@@ illons Unter@@ li@@ pp@@ le type of &quot; &quot; Singles &quot; &quot; whose former big @-@ man @-@ camp Andy feels like an old kn@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; there are the moments of random mad@@ ness that could heat this fran@@ chise as a kind of repet@@ ition : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : &quot; &quot; the last scene will show how they will visit the movie premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective on Amazon is now reminis@@ cent of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : the re@@ launch of the Cold War from &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even at &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ against @-@ West Ring@@ ing @-@ I@@ con@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka created com@@ edy by Rh@@ ys Thomas as a director giving a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , ath@@ e@@ ism and the way of Marx@@ ism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; the main roles - a hard se@@ ct@@ ant Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u U@@ lic@@ i , whose dialog@@ s of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt will be synchron@@ ized in English . &quot;
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some beautiful g@@ ags to look at ( the police spend time to watch chess on TV like Americans may do with football ) .
&quot; and the list of the famous actors - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ aned Sev@@ ign@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Find out the voice &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is involved so much for the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer that carries a Reagan mask , is involved - that it often plays as a single one . &quot;
&quot; six long episodes , the com@@ edy turns away , and com@@ edy is not fast or frequently enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , who has been re@@ inst@@ ated on a lower length , could better deliver his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ S@@ ati@@ re , as Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always occupied the American message , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who consume a he@@ ap of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary audience is that Western culture can make everything for a nest .
the fic@@ tive Romanian Creator isn &apos;t wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with it .
blow against drugs @-@ ma@@ fia in the country
the police ran a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Kon@@ stanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched , as the public prosecutor &apos;s office on Friday . &quot;
&quot; over the age of 25 and 77 , 15 were arrested and issued warran@@ ts against this arrest warran@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the officials presented large quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
two people were arrested during the same Raz@@ es in Italy .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
these two are therefore extra@@ d@@ ited to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
more than 300 polic@@ emen were employed .
&quot; the members of the Mafia will be organized drug crimin@@ ality , severe violence , attempted murder and rob@@ ber@@ y . &quot;
the public prosecutor &apos;s public prosecutor in southern Germany has been determined since summer 2016 .
&quot; between the State Bar in Constance and Palermo , a real exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contacts with their colleagues in Sicily . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the wholesale use on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; in the vision of the study , Italian nationals combined with respect to the Italian Mafia . &quot;
&quot; a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , beginning early in the morning , several shots were fired at the early mor@@ nings , is likely to go into the gang of bonds . &quot;
wise pro@@ claim major g@@ aps in the fore@@ igner regi@@ sters
&quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; : a report indicates the fore@@ igner @-@ register in Germany has significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
that lead to partially engraved patches with asylum procedures .
&quot; the Commissioner for refugee management of the federal government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has taken attention to a media report on big g@@ aps in the country register . &quot;
&quot; concerning the registered data , asylum procedures and deportation orders could lead to partly engraved failure , &quot; warned in an analysis which is the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the data , ten million people are registered with foreign nationality , including approximately 5.7 million out of non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data is therefore administered by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
&quot; because the data have not been sufficiently well maintained , the data quality in parts had not been good so far . &quot;
&quot; data from 1921 have been found in individual cases , &quot; of people who are long no longer alive , or by citizens who have become German citizens and in the register no longer should appear . &quot;
&quot; fla@@ wed data entry can considerably slow down processes , &quot; says the report following the report . &quot;
&quot; in statistics about travelling abroad , the EU citizens captured the EU citizens who would not have to travel . &quot;
&quot; however , these false assign@@ ments resulted in a dist@@ or@@ ded debate on dealing with traveling @-@ out events , therefore it is in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the federal government has apparently begun to return refugee families with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children back to Italy when they travelled from there . &quot;
&quot; this is out of an internal paper of the Federal Government for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) , the New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ re Newspaper reports . &quot;
&quot; in paper , this means that B@@ AM@@ F lead such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since June 1 , 2017 again . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , it was practically no longer possible , the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin agreements , the EU state is responsible for refugees to reach the EU . &quot;
&quot; if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send him back to the In@@ sit@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the reason : &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the admission capacity for families with minor children in Italy has significantly increased . &quot;
I submitted Italy for the recording and accomodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) contents are sufficient .
other EU states would also return refugees to the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; the internal political spokes@@ woman in the Bundestag , Ul@@ la Yel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children dro@@ pping because of the lack of Italian asylum system human rights violations and a endanger@@ ing child hab@@ itation . &quot;
second best result achieved
&quot; in total , 220 litres of blood from Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach living the blood circulation service already for other people . &quot;
&quot; at least of the twelve citizens , who were presented on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now spent 100 litres of blood with its inc@@ eption , has now donated 50 litres of blood . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the congregation in the meeting of the council &apos;s meeting the multiple will@@ ingness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is in@@ geni@@ ously how our body is created and we declare the don@@ ors of respect , which their blood is available for foreigners , even more un@@ profitable , &quot; under@@ ed Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the only blood don@@ ors helps several people , &quot; explained the county seat of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the preser@@ ves are de@@ composed into their components . &quot;
&quot; thus , three people could benefit from a blood@@ stream . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported the actions that were carried out in the Spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DR@@ K @-@ Regional Leader . &quot;
&quot; apparently , the change into the theatre house led to higher participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Meta Um@@ ars were don@@ ate for multiple partners and were awarded for 50 years of blood . &quot;
&quot; half as many book Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Rie@@ x@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter gave ten times a 500 milli@@ liter of its juice . &quot;
the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; the Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rates remain unchanged , after weak economic growth and the growth of inflation to increase the spec@@ ulation over an increase . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; remain , as they retained interest rates on family income in the middle of a reinforced pressure . &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the European Committee ( M@@ PC ) agreed with 6 to 2 to keep the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % . this month less members had an increase in which economic growth has increased support for an increase .
&quot; in its quarterly annual report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 on 1.7 % and for 2018 on 1.6 % and warned that pressure on the budget would be expected to rise to almost 3 % in the fall . &quot;
&quot; but it claims that in the next few years of interest they would need to cur@@ b inflation , and she said that the loan costs may have to rise more than expected to the financial markets . &quot;
the members also voted to withdraw a part of the Mamm@@ ut business package that was published before a year after the Bre@@ xit .
&quot; it will require time to provide funding for financial markets , even though it is said that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the framework of this system - with 115 billions of pounds Sterling . &quot;
&quot; after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) is weak ( GDP ) short @-@ term , as the pressure on the real @-@ income of households will continue to use consumption . &quot;
&quot; too , the interest rates repeated that &quot; a certain strains of monetary policy &quot; would be needed for the cooling down inflation and a &quot; slightly larger &quot; dimension than the markets expect . &quot;
the markets forecasts for the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; the bank , however , emphas@@ ized that enh@@ ancements &quot; progres@@ sively &quot; and &quot; limited &quot; would be made . &quot;
the Bank forecast growth forecasts for this and next year are 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the forecast for this and next year .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell down to these messages from the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
&quot; the decision to no change is coming , after the most dis@@ appointing growth figures have increased its increasing expectations to a rate of interest and increased GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households , affected by an increasing inflation and low @-@ level security threats , as the tigh@@ tening is still worse before they will repair themselves . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy in the next few years can &apos;t &quot; stop &quot; , &quot; but it added that wages at the end of their three years forecast &quot; will recover significantly . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also reinforced by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pounds , which is compens@@ ated in part of the lower consumer expenditure . &quot;
the decision made a year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote which caused the sin@@ king of the fun@@ nel .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will complete the prices and economy .
&quot; prior to the Bank &apos;s last verdict , the call has increased after a rate of interest , as the inflation increased its pressure on hard @-@ pressed households with three political decision @-@ makers in July to rise to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; in the past month , inflation was reduced from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected to wear it again in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said the aims at the relationship with its target of 2 % &quot; quite &quot; to the weak Po@@ und .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ an , Director of Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the short return of s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market could be more competitive , as the credit@@ ors are looking forward to shops and would like to finish in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks especially good for those who conclude the existing De@@ als and the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) should rub a controversial HIV @-@ drug 10.000 people
patients will be obtained from September after a fight against the financing of the medication at the N@@ HS access to a &quot; trans@@ forming &quot; HIV @-@ venti@@ onal treatment .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that one before the lov@@ em@@ aking pre @-@ positi@@ rop@@ hy@@ la@@ x ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection at high risk factor by around 86 percent , is now delivered by health service over a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he declared itself ready to finance the trial , after the Court of Appeal uph@@ eld a verdict of the Supreme Court ruling that the N@@ HS had to pay attention to the Pr@@ EP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , chess was announced by N@@ HS England CEO Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) was described as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield are among the first those who will enable the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October 2018 in the whole of England . &quot;
pre@@ positioning sp@@ rop@@ hy@@ la@@ x ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV treatment that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP is significantly reduced the HIV transmission to Inf@@ ection .
Pr@@ EP in front of intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or as two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; for those who come to question , gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and individuals with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been successfully treated successfully . &quot;
&quot; in clinics , appropriate participants are identified , which agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy . &quot;
&quot; people who live in England and join a resident , can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic . &quot;
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs in this week after an international competitive purchase .
&quot; the study is expected to assess the entire potential of Pr@@ EP by clinical evidence as it is targeted in large scale , and is implemented . &quot;
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should add the broad@@ ening and increasingly successful efforts for prevention of HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of progress in the forests of one of the greatest health challenges of human@@ kind .
&quot; Deborah Gold , Chief Executive Officer of NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ EP , when targeted and vulnerable people are targeted , the opportunity to change the English HIV @-@ epidemic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards people with a high HIV @-@ risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument , which is really individually controlled and not with a partner is subject to improve many , many lives . &quot;
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , Head of the Terror of Terror Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority has to be done so that the study has to be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one has left an risk for HIV . &quot;
&quot; now , as the Pr@@ EP test medicine was created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; Sharon Hodg@@ son , Sha@@ dows of Health Minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP trial is welcome after months of delay and delayed implementation by the government . &quot;
&quot; the evidence shows how transformed this drug as part of our approach to HIV @-@ prevention , and can end the transmission of these life @-@ changing infection . &quot;
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people that are infected with HIV , and that they contribute to the end of the spread of HIV in society a step closer . &quot;
life live : mezzanine and clever designers tricks have transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment in a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with passion for real estate , shr@@ inking in 2014 from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I searched for something that was comparable to my price .
I showed this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
I love myself in love and made an offer on this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a single room property with a fine layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine to optim@@ ally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , much light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; to this end , she commissioned the architects and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi in Notting Hill that was a 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home , not just a development , but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine with a mezzanine where you could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to consider cre@@ atively to resolve the submission .
&quot; the steel movement is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so arranged that they were stacked together , without that we had to g@@ aps ourselves . &quot;
&quot; it wasn &apos;t just about building a simple platform , but to lay the steel so that it had the right height for the top or below . &quot;
&quot; this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height , with much additional drama . &quot;
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window of ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us comes down via the gl@@ am@@ orous living area . &quot;
&quot; gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of sk@@ e@@ wers plays a role when adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to make it longer . &quot;
in the kitchen you feel like a window in another room .
&quot; at the entrance , mir@@ ro@@ red units for all top @-@ corner and glasses of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ am@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room is able to close the kitchen when it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
so special about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of stainless steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is important , so it is when you push the door high , very easily gli@@ des . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the cle@@ ver@@ able use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne additional 16 m ² could win , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the footprint - or as your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in an ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary form , a real estate agents will occur and a calculation is based on soil size . &quot;
&quot; here they managed to enlarge the ground surface , and simultaneously to use high @-@ quality materials that make room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and that therefore help to create an emotional ties in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not love yourself in the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot;
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment itself can be transformed by good design and increased square meters of slightly standard@@ ly into something completely pre@@ dict@@ able .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could choose to leave this not . &quot;
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar empire
&quot; two decades now there are four decades , after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a meditation on one of the biggest real estate imperialist Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a Villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and their assets shall be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion about the separation is held in the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , accumulated , since the 1973 family purchased a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
there the West@@ co Je@@ ans founded je@@ ans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
&quot; this money has been invested in real estate , and its portfolio of De Lut@@ is now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Bruns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her late father , Colin - von Paul is known as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lut@@ is family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s share and Paul about one third . &quot;
a judicial report states that this means that Colin Property is owned by $ 316 million and Paul worth $ 176 million in the value of $ 176 million .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved for Paul as a test point .
&quot; the time of Colin proposed th@@ a@@ releases have left him with what I kept for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot;
&quot; on the last Friday , after several failed inter@@ medi@@ ation , the Supreme Court of Justice took place . &quot;
&quot; the brothers also fight for the control of the existing business - of which Colin , as Paul claims to be excluded . &quot;
&quot; Colin argu@@ ed that this is not true , but raises Paul to manage some possessions . &quot;
&quot; in an early E@@ id@@ av@@ it , which was filed by Colin , he says he was hoping to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cost increases in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , emails and reports of companies , including del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and both sides of the law firm . &quot;
&quot; Ms. De Lut@@ is and her late husband Luigi , Italian immigrants , operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen products from the late 1950 @-@ er years and bought a shop in Bruns@@ wick in the early 1970s . &quot;
they used safety to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood song in which Colin made the first je@@ ans charge of the family .
Colin says that he started West@@ co as he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) .
&quot; Anna De Lut@@ is said that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed to give her property to her sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi I often said to me , that he never wanted to land the brothers in court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lut@@ is Corporate Group , whereby Colin claims that Mark had paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark , Paul says , &quot; says Paul &quot; on the terms of their financial separation . &quot;
Colin has kept herself very well even though he was a former AF@@ L board and after a biography made of Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s best friend of TV .
Fair@@ fax Media took with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and their lawyers contact .
&quot; only Colin answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad , that my brother Paul had decided to acc@@ use me and to bring our family names through the courts , he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end in our current contro@@ versy , &quot; &quot; he said and added that he was still in a solution . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , this hope seemed to be over . &quot;
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; wrote Colin . &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps of new Chief of Staff is planning to limit media abst@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly may actually do it .
&quot; if yes , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; POL@@ IT@@ ICO that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the information flow to President Tr@@ ump , including the reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on an even better course . &quot;
here is a piece by reporter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , in his first working day with senior employees , he introduced a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House , which he would repair : bad information that into the hands of the president . &quot;
Kelly told the staff that information should flow via him - whether on paper or in post@@ ings - because the president would make better choices if he would have good information .
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitoring its media monitoring . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s relationship to television is enough for decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was anno@@ yed because of un@@ fair coverage , it was productive to show it that he received a fair coverage of jobs that were to convince him , &quot; said the former election campaign of Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February to POL@@ IT@@ ICO . &quot;
&quot; Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter habits in control , according to six former election campaign officials to ensure that his personal media sum includes a ste@@ ady praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter @-@ hab@@ it ever &quot; was under control &quot; is ridicul@@ ous .
perhaps these campaign officials know what we do not know - that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twe@@ et could not contain more ignition material without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump is not sent .
&quot; if his collabor@@ ators were able to keep him away some times , anno@@ y@@ ance of him , their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
but nobody has consistently been able to prevent Tr@@ ump Cont@@ ro@@ ver@@ sen .
&quot; a part of the problem exists that people in a White House , which consists of competing parties , will always try to present their own agenda by making tr@@ ump material that possibly promotes their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; in May , POL@@ IT@@ ICO - informed about this story - reported information about the pre@@ ference for strategic reasons about the pre@@ ference for strategic reasons . &quot;
&quot; this was an example , which was described by reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher : &quot;
&quot; current and former tr@@ ump officials say Tr@@ ump as a volcano can react to negative press sections , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he can find out to find out where these are from . &quot;
&quot; exactly this happened at the end of February , when somebody accused the printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy Chief of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; at the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson had been banned from Twitter because he has offered no specific evidence , or that he was in the past false alleg@@ ations and calls them in the past . &quot;
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask employees about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , tried to implement a system to manage the paper@@ work and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his adviser are still stri@@ ving for influence . &quot;
this un@@ changeable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
Master requested bur@@ gl@@ ar to get the post of Europ@@ ol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the help of the population is praying and hop@@ ed . &quot;
the police have been sent to dangerous crimin@@ als during this summer ( virtual ) postcards .
&quot; since the addresses of the sought @-@ for@@ war@@ y de@@ crimin@@ als are not known , not@@ ices of the population will be hop@@ ed and pray . &quot;
Europ@@ ol reported on Friday from the action to follow the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; -@@ Adv@@ ent calendar from winter .
&quot; the experiences would have shown that many volatile and holiday homes hide , it was the name of Europ@@ ol . &quot;
one have put 21 postcards covering selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online jobs could have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to the publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negoti@@ ate on a dit@@ ch and return to &apos; Million@@ aire @-@ Series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home owner of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some secure trav@@ ellers on the f@@ are@@ foot that have drawn up a field in front of their Manor houses .
the traveler have par@@ ked its 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a wealthy road of Soli@@ hull to be called the &quot; Million@@ aire @-@ Series . &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and a army of transporter , after they were thrown out only in May without being shot down from one of the excav@@ ated dit@@ ch to prevent their fail@@ ures . &quot;
the tac@@ tic group found a gap in the defense posts and pushed its vehicles through a section which remained un@@ ob@@ stru@@ cted to find a way .
&quot; angry inhabitants have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening , after they were sent away from the Bentley Heath where they have cast stones to the pass@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the Council must be forced through shame to implement , as it was us@@ eless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travelers were there in May , moved on and are now back . &quot;
&quot; more arrived yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to move around in order to protect long distances to protect their parks . &quot;
I live on the Stre@@ et@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay my common dest@@ iny if the Council can &apos;t stop this .
&quot; a resident who didn &apos;t want to be called , &quot; &quot; It is ridicul@@ ous , we just saw the last round of these travelers , just to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and even saw a horse in the parking area .
an spokes@@ woman of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of the camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ us@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to pull them as fast as possible .
&quot; to support our physical collection , it is very important that many residents can report a anti @-@ social or criminal conduct in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must test , when we submit our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof the forest hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house at the gates of Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March the next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closure of the hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then ambi@@ ence of company mbH to April 13 , 2014 , some 30 000 nights were lost per year and will also be paid by the local fee . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in view of dramatic numbers of refugees , which came to the county , the hotel building offered the country house as a collective accommodation , provided for controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers through the order of an development plan to secure the area as a hotel site .
the decision was not un@@ disputed then at that time .
&quot; but especially Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts , Mayor of Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and talked about serious interested parties in the house at that time . &quot;
he should keep right .
the group of Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and will make it a house of the three @-@ star plus @-@ category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt facility .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Mann@@ al@@ b .
&quot; Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof since a longer time building container in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house , the extensive renov@@ ations will be made . &quot;
&quot; so@@ ils were torn apart , blank@@ ets are dismant@@ led , antique tubes are removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be re@@ done in the Black Forest .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large @-@ walk showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new window will be installed . &quot;
&quot; everything should be &quot; beautiful near &quot; , &quot; like Thomas Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot;
&quot; pool , wellness area and a meeting room includes the equipment . &quot;
&quot; it is not to move on to the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already emphas@@ ized on an elevated inner city level , st@@ resses Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; Lu@@ ise &apos;s Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms , will be explained further . &quot;
&quot; both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , he already led , so she@@ er . &quot;
the ideas of the city are the same with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; after the height of the investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer wants to define himself exactly . &quot;
&quot; less than one million euros , he reck@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; external comple@@ xes are also brought to fore@@ man , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is open from the restaurant , which is open to the public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimi@@ stic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : U.S. Special Representative sets a Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair of US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Robert Mu@@ eller is designed to have a so @-@ called Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; in the past weeks , the board recorded the work , the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; wrote under appeal to the thing confi@@ dential . &quot;
the newspaper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded its investigation and intensi@@ fied .
&quot; CNN reported that , in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps , a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps , CNN reported a meeting with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps . &quot;
U.S. intelligence acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin for a long time targeted in the presidential election campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller is investig@@ ating whether they were talking about Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigations , several men are to stand as a consultant of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more Tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment among the micro@@ scope . &quot;
&quot; in some weeks , the Washington Post wrote a couple of weeks ago that the Special Representative Tr@@ ump is personally cont@@ ested , whether the President is han@@ dicapped accessible to the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
&quot; to prove and decide the main task of Grand Law@@ ys , to check and decide whether the charges will be charged . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Pro@@ secution were also called the Pro@@ secution . &quot;
&quot; they are mostly switched on , when there are larger and controversial cases . &quot;
the proceedings always takes place behind closed doors .
the panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to invite people to hearing under oath .
&quot; according to the broad@@ caster , CNN have already issued pre @-@ loading , which turn around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; persons who participated in the meeting were invited to be a statement , called it in the report . &quot;
they should also provide documents .
&quot; besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ um@@ ps Consult@@ ant and S@@ wimm@@ ers had J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ers as well as his dam@@ aging election campaign Paul Man@@ a@@ fort with the conversation . &quot;
&quot; right experts said on Thursday night in US television that the creation show that Mu@@ eller should not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work , and that he should be necessary to act fast . &quot;
&quot; but it must not be called inev@@ it@@ ably , that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the survey of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the suspension of the age in the beginning of a new phase was in the investigations and a new reason to concern president Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President found a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the theme give the Democrats a way to feel &quot; feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about what they can speak . &quot;
&quot; his special adviser T@@ y Cob@@ b declared in a statement , he kno@@ b nothing of the creation of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; this also work usually in obe@@ dience , he stressed . &quot;
the White House feared any measures that accelerated the work of the Special Representative to &quot; f@@ aire &quot; .
the former FBI boss James Com@@ ey have said three times that they should not be determined against the President .
&quot; I have no reason to assume that something has been changed , the name was in the explanation . &quot;
Mu@@ eller was first used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey was fired .
&quot; because of this ra@@ fs , accus@@ ations against tr@@ ump had become noisy , he wants to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate committee , tr@@ ump I asked for an attitude of the investigations against the then national safety advisor Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
the president is under pressure due to the investigation .
&quot; as a result of US media , the White House raised material against the Special Representative and its employees . &quot;
this dissolved spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller is released .
&quot; unlike an independent Special Representative of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , in order to rec@@ alled by the President Richard Nixon , Mu@@ eller has said a position in which he might be fired by the president of Justice of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators set up the law on Thursday , after which the Special Representative could not be so easy . &quot;
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic Ice mountain drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
&quot; in the West@@ ant@@ ar@@ ctic , a gigantic ice@@ berg has been replaced by almost seven times the can@@ opy of the castle . &quot;
this was the result of the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener Institute for polar and marine research on Wednesday .
&quot; more than a trillion tonnes of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers can be removed from now to the north and will probably take two , three years until he melted . &quot;
&quot; with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice @-@ gig@@ ants who have registered in the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger for people out of him .
&quot; in what extent of climate change has played a role in the demol@@ ition of the ice , it is un@@ clear to research . &quot;
&quot; however , since about 30 years , there has been a series of unusual co@@ qu@@ arri@@ es in the region , writes the US Research Centre of snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a fact background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming . &quot;
the colon@@ ized Kol@@ oss was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C scra@@ p .
Sch@@ el@@ solem@@ n floating on the sea and is fed by great gl@@ aciers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ark is located south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ ar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this scra@@ pie was the balance of wa@@ xing and dis@@ rupt@@ ing a few years ago .
&quot; a complete ch@@ el@@ iness would fall there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is quite a lot of doing that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ iness is in danger , because the front edge had never been withdrawn as far as currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice plate can stand under tension and can be dismant@@ led , in case of a key place . &quot;
&quot; the melt of scra@@ ps and Eis@@ berg increases the sea level , as they swim on the water and p@@ ushes the ice as much water as it emerg@@ es after the melt . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the ball leads to that the glacier can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; that could possibly increase the sea level , but only in a small extent , writes the British research project for observation of the Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI @-@ C , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ celebrating is the fourth largest in Antar@@ c@@ tica for almost 50 000 square kilometers . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 metres thick , on the front edge to the free ocean around 200 metres . &quot;
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; although there is a natural phenomenon and no direct connection to climate change is , the Polar sign is now in a dangerous position , &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary by the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most comprehensive retreat since the beginning of records , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; among scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ iness would be back again , or in the long term , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even if this researchers will not re@@ sign the demol@@ ition of this gigantic ice@@ berg on climate change , so in recent decades the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen very much . &quot;
this long skir@@ t of the Antar@@ c@@ tica extends for South America .
&quot; according to data from the research program British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometers in the 1950s . &quot;
the decrease has contributed to the decline .
&quot; in the past 50 years , Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have heated up around three degrees and t@@ ame among the areas where the temperature is fastest growing . &quot;
CDU wants to do the pet
&quot; because it becomes more difficult to fill out @-@ free jobs , the CDU , from the employer association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , the day of delivery has 41 new jobs in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 trainees have their first working day behind . &quot;
the courses in the circle are obviously very desired .
&quot; around 620 applications were recorded for this year , too . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the district is still missing personnel to handle the increased requirements and tasks . &quot;
currently there are in the circle M@@ ett@@ mann as far as 50 non @-@ occupied places .
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers and forces are sought for general management . &quot;
the CDU would like to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and join the skilled worker in the administration .
&quot; according to the request of the parties , the administration is to work for the personnel profit and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to cover not only short @-@ term printing on skilled workers , but future @-@ oriented application of the applicant is to counter@@ act . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be oriented to interior and outside , specific measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and include a training initiative , demand CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
that sounds like a good approach .
&quot; because the circle has done it to do with personal problems , which we did not know earlier . &quot;
&quot; other cities advert@@ ise good officials and employees , offering more attractive conditions . &quot;
the speech is from a regular &quot; competition of public employer . &quot;
&quot; to this end , there is a high number of employees , the disease - or age @-@ due to the service . &quot;
&quot; so , the highest time to act , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; Klaus @-@ Dieter Pe@@ oples , the chief of the CDU , goes beyond its party with his party . &quot;
he had long gone on the chal@@ k for a f@@ aust@@ ere surprise when he presented the personnel cost @-@ cover@@ t public in question and dis@@ concer@@ ted the rest of the parties .
people want all possibilities to be reviewed that allow an exit from the municipal employer association .
&quot; if we do not come in short notice of a satisfactory solution , the trade union with the trade unions - may also aim in cooperation with the affiliated towns , as well as in cooperation with the affiliated towns , so people . &quot;
&quot; thus , the CDU , employees and officials are trying to pay better than the tariff for public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently mandatory , enh@@ ancements or more money is only if one changes in a higher level , orient@@ ated for vocational years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle are increasingly grown in recent years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms have to be set up , in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute law law . &quot;
&quot; last but not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter has a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy intensi@@ fies the tone to NGO @-@ migrants life@@ jack@@ ets
&quot; in Italy , NGOs , in order to use the life @-@ boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that it will not be able to continue this in new rules for its operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs have no new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Min@@ n@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ n@@ itis War@@ ning met a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat of the German charity organization &apos; Youth R@@ ohn &apos; , because their crew had worked effectively with traff@@ ick@@ ers in a manner that lighten@@ ed illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation since one year , refused to express itself in exec@@ utions of the Italian State of Ambro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the rescue of human life remains our top priority . so , we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone &quot; , &quot; the organization said in an opinion on the social media . &quot;
&quot; we can only judge all the accus@@ ations , which are currently being collected , only after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities used the boat from &apos; Youth R@@ eig@@ n &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a since October . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that its crew will be supplied hose @-@ boat migrants who can directly be delivered directly from traff@@ ick@@ ers , so that s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can drive them again , so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such a meeting was supposedly held only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the testimony of the government , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation has been suspected , through the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the life sentences in the zone out of humanitarian grounds and not from any other moti@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats need to have boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a primarily an Italian police officers and monitored their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations , have so far been declared to keep the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be un@@ necessarily , but acceptable , since they would have no &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue actions . &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize @-@ winning organization Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; Min@@ n@@ iti meanwhile said that the number of migrants who came to Italy in the past few weeks , said that the efforts to strengthen the strengthening of Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with the local civil society . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives , and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali about actions to reduce the number of migrants who want to leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
ascent and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine W@@ eil@@ mer Bik@@ er , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the northern Palat@@ inate , to enjoy four days of Tri@@ als and Sight@@ se@@ ein@@ gs . &quot;
three friendly Gu@@ ides stood available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Valley turned out to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
&quot; the first tour went on hot summer temperatures across the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim . &quot;
&quot; there were look@@ out spots , partly on towers , of which one could look far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest and the front @-@ bearing levels . &quot;
&quot; in between , there were always longer suit , for the long tri@@ p@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; on the second day , it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the People &apos;s Liberation Market . &quot;
&quot; again , look@@ out spot on look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate enrich@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in the last two days , many al@@ tim@@ eter had been told . &quot;
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and conv@@ ection brought will@@ s breaks . &quot;
&quot; in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers die in the outdoor pool of healing Sole . &quot;
Neustadt was also controlled .
&quot; after 173 kilometers and nearly 4500 meters , the group had learned the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest of his best side - sporty and cultural . &quot;
console instead of lawn - Bundesliga is ideal for e @-@ sport
&quot; the sport stars in future will sit in future computer consoles , rather than to fight through the wind and weather about the stadium stage ? &quot;
&quot; fact : E @-@ Sport has long since become a serious industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gain . &quot;
&quot; this also recognized the first federal stat@@ aver@@ aver@@ ic , which increasingly engage in this field . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2015 , the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg , later followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire all new target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Management Board Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is sure , &quot; that on this move , some associations rise up . &quot;
&quot; next weekend , FIFA World Cup FIFA organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ ers will compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfsburg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or PS@@ V Eindhoven are qualified . &quot;
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has meanwhile advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; in particular , the real football needs to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people are still going to go into the stadium , &quot; says the 52 year old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian , to conquer . &quot;
&quot; with prominent E @-@ athletes among the contract , one might be present more often more often on these markets than just once a year , to send the Federal Government to Asia . &quot;
what is it exactly ?
&quot; at the E @-@ Sport computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or the FIFA sim@@ ulations to compete for competitions . &quot;
&quot; long as in normal sport , Li@@ es established itself , in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot;
and in the 2022 World Cup E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it all about the right sport ?
&quot; for many , the performance is safe . &quot;
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ber@@ y has also been dealt long with the question .
&quot; for the professor at the German Sport@@ s- University in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because he is competent and many biological and physical reactions , for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; moreover , it needs cogn@@ itive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick response capability . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should not only train at the console , but also train their body and watch out on the diet . &quot;
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; however , di@@ bi@@ ous looks even problems : &quot; d@@ oping is always a subject . &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult for online gaming , and in the scene failed the structures of classic sports . &quot;
&quot; a positive result , the scientist raises the high integr@@ ative effect of E @-@ Sports . &quot;
&quot; players are international on the way , this is like a big global family , there are no inter@@ cultural shirts . &quot;
a study by management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Inter@@ active Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the E @-@ Sport rapid growth .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been converted to Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , sales at 130 million is expected . &quot;
&quot; against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the soccer league , this is little . &quot;
&quot; however , the E @-@ Sport is not far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ hockey , write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant . &quot;
international are many countries already .
great markets are Asia and the US where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez participate in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton K@@ ut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport competition Uni@@ cr@@ n .
there is a lot in Europe too .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , E @-@ sport has been introduced as a teaching position , says F@@ rob@@ ber@@ y . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and France , the football @-@ only league clubs according to D@@ utt has meanwhile been obliged to host an e @-@ sport department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany declined , &quot; V@@ f@@ B Executive Board explains R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; only in nostal@@ gia to fall , and the old times to clari@@ fy , is not enough anymore . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore , to preserve the tradition of the association , but the company at the same time setting up the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digit@@ alised world , &quot; also D@@ utt &apos;s . &quot;

&quot; by the scandal of po@@ ison@@ ous eggs , almost all states are affected . &quot;
Al@@ di South and Al@@ di Nord re@@ acts and have taken all the eggs from the sale .
&quot; in the shelves , only eggs are to be taken , which have been shown to have been identified . &quot;
&quot; Michelle Carter , because of the lyrics , he condemned Conrad Roy to suicide . &quot;
&quot; a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her boy@@ friend by texts and calls to suicide . &quot;
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their conviction behind bars and five years were suspended on par@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; Carter was convicted in June because of the killing of Conrad Roy , who took life on July 13 , 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until his appeal .
&quot; she was confron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives argu@@ ed that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a psych@@ ic illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red tro@@ users and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ use , Carter came with tears in her eyes , folded hands and down@@ ward eyes when she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; her actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; said the Prosecutor &apos;s government . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ters said that it was a &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance , whom they totally regret . &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , &quot; &quot; He did not find out that her &quot; age or irrit@@ ation wheel or even their spirits have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a public prosecutor read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said it wasn &apos;t a day that I did not get the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I would like to be proud of me and as I go with everything . I try , despite all my pain that we are carrying out for eternity with us , for his sisters , is to be there for eternity . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she would be &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; that she would never be able to participate in the wedding of her brother or a aun@@ t for his children . &quot;
&quot; not to have this only person to have been together since my birth every day , a pain that I will keep for the rest of my life forever , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to set a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to claim to commit suicide . &quot;
&quot; Carter was 17 years old , when Roy was found dead of a carbon mono@@ xide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the case drew national attention to itself , after car@@ ving text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to quit his life . &quot;
&quot; hanging down , spring of a building , give yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the eyes of his suicide she wrote : &quot; you have to do , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing that you must do is to switch the generator , and you will be free and happy . &quot;
&quot; judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter was seeking attention through the death of Roy , and ordered that they should take advantage of some press . &quot;
the case has shared the legal notice .
&quot; to the few who defended Carter , Am@@ anda Knox , who was convicted of murder on her British fellow worker in Italy in 2007 before she was acquitted on two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Knox , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ i : learning from the new mini @-@ Lah@@ m of the Bayern
&quot; in the Audi Cup , Joshua K@@ imm@@ i was allowed to run as a captain in the Audi Cup , is no coincidence . &quot;
the FC Bayern offers a big season to the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner a big season - Extra motivation does not harm .
&quot; something else was in his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich immediately , even if the additional garment was very small , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to see him , he turned himself into his arms . &quot;
&quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; told the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner after his first use as Bavaria @-@ captain . &quot;
good that I could have better run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but I could suggest the sign from the coach too .
&quot; not the eight years older Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen among youth players , Deb@@ üt@@ ants and especially from the holiday professionals of existing C @-@ El@@ f as a player guide , but he . &quot;
&quot; Su@@ gar@@ l is best distributed to those who want to eat a lot , which one wants to keep on the mood . &quot;
&quot; so who , who was chosen to compete in Lah@@ m , can only use small extra @-@ motivation only well . &quot;
K@@ imm@@ i confirmed : &quot; this is what you want to be as a player : taking responsibility .
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old took over the field as a mini @-@ lame . &quot;
&quot; right behind , that is now his position , the white bin@@ ds on the arm did their rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , K@@ imm@@ i worked at this starting point as the one that the ru@@ dder can take place best into the hand . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to direct the in@@ jected tro@@ upe . &quot;
&quot; he had a look for the whole , while many others were involved with themselves . &quot;
V@@ idal makes his missing fitness to play ( fol@@ ks barely ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches to link the devil on the services of the Asia journey ( s also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as sw@@ inging to fall into their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t .
&quot; at all , it worked quite well . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ le ran next to K@@ imm@@ i , Rud@@ y in front of the defense , both agile . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was very difficult , and also , Sü@@ le tried also a few times a few times . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Rud@@ y told him that the result was &quot; not so , as we &apos;d hop@@ ed it would be . &quot;
but also he showed a proper performance in the Debut .
&quot; time change , temp@@ o change : &quot; for this style , I was brought fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; as un@@ usual , this Bavaria @-@ world still exists for the trans@@ itions , one looked to the game . &quot;
&quot; for example , Rud@@ y was not one or two or two or seven interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs . &quot;
K@@ imm@@ i passed away after some kn@@ itting statements on his new te@@ amm@@ ate .
&quot; there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; what is going on , have I noticed now . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he must not teach the new one more . &quot;

&quot; company content with Rhineland @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ic minister : economy , Wis@@ sings temp@@ o &quot;
&quot; often un@@ reconc@@ iled , the relationship between the country and regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still economic minister of Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate . &quot;
&quot; this is , after more than one year , in which the new business minister Volker Wiss@@ ing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
&quot; chambers and companies from the region speak to T V @-@ request from a change in economic policy , and t@@ ad@@ resses at the same time the old Minister . &quot;
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Companies ( V@@ TU ) , says , &quot; Dis@@ ing attacks the desires of the economy on which Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
Nat@@ us saw the biggest about revolution in infrastructure politics : the route of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now in the pri@@ or@@ tive list of the country now at the top .
&quot; this year , the Ministry hopes for planning procedure , until 2021 the construction is to be right . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country , also the western part of Trier , plays in the prec@@ in@@ sist@@ ence demand of the federal government schedule . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to take the distance in December 2020 in operation , says Prime Minister Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ us provides a sign for regional , but international competing companies . &quot;

&quot; a premium of € 1000 is fore@@ seen for the ingredients and 2500 Euros , when graduates are self @-@ confident within ten years . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country stays long .
&quot; the planned road construction will be quick to create facts , at the same time there failed the country the necessary staff , Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , chief executive leader of the I@@ HK Trier . &quot;

the I@@ HK requires more orders to external offices to be awarded .

Audi is to change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are confron@@ ted with an anti@@ re@@ action reaction
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi said , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW @-@ president , said the company is the opinion that &quot; there are smar@@ ter options as a limited limit , &quot; and moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - diesel vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in Tuesday , Daimler announced that it will be able to modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions . &quot;
none of the company described the company as recall .
European autom@@ akers have encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but nitrogen oxi@@ des , em@@ it diesel engines , apply as carcin@@ ogenic and can cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of automotive manufacturers , installations for neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles to install exhaust gases , also take advantage of what it makes difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful auto companies and signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the error of Volkswagen which could regulate the use of so @-@ called switching units , to regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but at normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were indicted by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former head of Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in the Audi engine development in Germany . &quot;
&quot; former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be tried in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations into Volkswagen after the authorities have accused the system installed to handle the emissions regulations in Europe , and one request that focused on the United States has been expanded . &quot;
&quot; the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could perform Volkswagen heavily : the luxury car manufacturer carries a proportional to profit from Volkswagen . &quot;

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ ases and the laughter against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ dil@@ lo was one of the best @-@ published carto@@ ons , the buttons of his statues are the hall@@ mark . &quot;
the Argentin@@ ier still works with 85 and works in a film .
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; Because there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ dil@@ lo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immig@@ rant in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first few years as an artist , he struck himself among other things as drawing for greetings cards - what fru@@ str@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ iest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; after stations in Lima , New York and Paris , at the end of the &apos; 60s the breakthrough : with the release of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match , and then also in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ dil@@ lo many fans found .
&quot; again , the artist had inspired by the cities . &quot;
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ dil@@ lo figures with the shooting of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , he is still sitting according to the drawing date , almost ten hours daily . &quot;

for the first time his figures speak in the 3D @-@ film which should come to the cinema wall in 2019 .
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they &apos;re saying is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ dil@@ lo . &quot;

&quot; this is why he rather reli@@ es on the TV series , which , as his original drawings , is produced . &quot;
lavender from Provence on Climate Change
&quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is threatened with climate change . &quot;
&quot; the lavender is due to the conditions of drought remin@@ ded conditions and due to diseases transmitted , which scientists and farmers trying to find solutions to find solutions , great head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert on farm research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant was exposed to the effects of climate change in the spring of much less rain and in autumn much more . &quot;
this has effects on the lif@@ esp@@ an of lavender .
&quot; there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the d@@ warf c@@ ading , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
&quot; lavender oil lo@@ oms not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also popular for perfume and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of very long plant tubes with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; so , we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; solutions that are considered to be considered are a better water distribution and slow@@ ing of ev@@ ap@@ oration in the soil , but also the plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are compared to dry @-@ resistant . &quot;

the Ass@@ assin@@ ation of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; on Wed@@ nes@@ days , the employees of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce met normally on Wed@@ nes@@ days to examine their plans for the latest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt civil servants and un@@ ce@@ asing drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security . &quot;
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children to the office , who were the goal of the attack with gren@@ ades , or leave them at home in 2009 . &quot;
&quot; safety experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room : opponent , neutral , ally . &quot;
&quot; you ask the reporter , names for each column - no evidence is necessary , perc@@ ep@@ tions and abdominal feelings . &quot;
&quot; there are drugs s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the secret list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico . &quot;
&quot; there is no rest from the violence , and throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses are frequent , there are more journalists . at least 25 , since the President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto took office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 have been standing for attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries . &quot;
&quot; among the latter is their editor and her inspir@@ ator of Ri@@ o@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake it is to be living in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot;
&quot; his lack is felt deeply , although its presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; t @-@ shirts , wearing T @-@ shirts , who show his smiling face with glasses or typical Panam@@ anian . &quot;
&quot; the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and the reporter discuss their shared themes , trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; even though , in 2010 , a Son@@ ata Con@@ federation was erected to edit the cases of journalists , according to the Committee to protect journalists only two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of murders , who are connected every year with drug traff@@ icking and organised crime , the mur@@ derer of journalists are rarely provided . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they are still able to handle the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a while they are in@@ separ@@ able , even though the terrain is still av@@ eng@@ aging . &quot;
&quot; without information on the mur@@ derer , without justice , the meeting on the discussion of security is little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know what we know , we know all . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he only managed to drive a few blocks away , before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was arrested by two men . he was shot out of his car and was shot at him for 12 times , probably due to the name of the newspaper , who translated with &quot; twelve river . &quot; &quot;
the shooter ran away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ours tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans arrest last year and delivery in the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a had become one of the country &apos;s bloody batt@@ le@@ fields , as rival fac@@ tions here fight to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the road , or that the cemetery is full of emb@@ ell@@ ished , two @-@ story maus@@ ole@@ een for drug @-@ builders , which are bigger than many homes for the living . &quot;
&quot; forget it for a minute that there is a state of &quot; rest , &quot; if only a Kart@@ ell has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading routes to the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ ce , was bl@@ ended with guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February the publication of a interview with Dam@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of the ri@@ val@@ ing cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication might have dep@@ and@@ alized the sons , followed by Gang@@ es , bought every copy of the output , as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez , not to force , according to the decision of another newspaper , which had published the same story , to leave the country to its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his murder is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
&quot; he had survived so long for his friends and colleagues , that he would always be there . &quot;
&quot; he worked as an experienced journalist for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined together with five colleagues to the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold over 50 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter any of the d@@ utch problem , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said . &quot;
&quot; with the time , the newspaper earned a call for the cour@@ ageous and honest coverage , and the sales and advertising participated . &quot;
&quot; rep@@ orters loved it to be published without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship , and the readers were intri@@ gu@@ ed by a publication that they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to deal with . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for their reporting in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage at the prosecution of the Mexican drug history , wherever she also led them . &quot;
he gave himself up to that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue , &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot;
&quot; drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV in October . &quot;
you need to take over the task to get to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; What have you done so many of the dead ... why did you not say what went before ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team lost Val@@ dez , the fun bird that could curse the fun , who was gener@@ ously with hu@@ gs and suggestions , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted on his routine .
he always would carry his hat .
&quot; he would always sit to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit on the same table . &quot;
&quot; now they ask : was his love for routine , his cal@@ am@@ ity ? &quot;
&quot; his death also forced them to ask her own ass@@ ump@@ tions in question , how to do their work in the best and staying alive . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like it if you are dealing with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home starting and landing ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cen@@ sored and self @-@ keeping . &quot;
trust his own inst@@ in@@ ers .
&quot; when it doesn &apos;t smell , stay away . &quot;
&quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real said , &quot; smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing with Javier happens . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , apply in Sin@@ alo@@ a no more - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which a toxic mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ ums , weak institutions and corrupt government officials . &quot;
the landscape changes constantly .
&quot; in the room where the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for security training , suddenly no cell phones were allowed . days ago , Spy@@ ware that is exclusively sold to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
two polic@@ emen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
&quot; they were commissioned by the state government , to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ class building in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; half in she@@ ath , some of the rep@@ orters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who described the governor themselves as not tru@@ st@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months ago , since the reporter passed into the mountain landscape , where the drug regim@@ ens are not under control . &quot;
&quot; for the output of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has on three main layers . &quot;
there was the assassination of the brother of the former known Box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the government spending , concentrated on the home town of the Governor . &quot;
&quot; there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office building , a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or as it happened , so caution was done when everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite source of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a Politi@@ ker , who ruled the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled almost the entire century all political levels . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of up@@ heav@@ al cases of corruption . &quot;
&quot; in this restaurant , in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man asked for a military incident in this restaurant , in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; was a military incident . &quot;
&quot; just a few months earlier , readers had seen the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about the ab@@ duction . &quot;
&quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its sl@@ ender body . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez &apos;s office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stick@@ ers , who are protest@@ ing against the murders of journalists , because the employees have become something that they never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
reporter Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez grab@@ bed a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration due to another journalist to the Office of the State .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; a burnt body was discovered and officials , based on DNA tests that it is his . &quot;
journalists all over the country have become stronger than journalists in the organised protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; in obe@@ dience and construction projects .
&quot; on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone to Washington and tried to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; in a meeting with the Governor of Zin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to spy journalists and to kill them because they have said the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has since then asked that it is divided by the government , because she is concerned that their anger has viol@@ ated their objec@@ tivity . &quot;
Val@@ dez had repeatedly told that journalists in Mexico organized by organizing crimes committed to the government officials and an equal company .
&quot; in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that rep@@ orters are not only killed by drug abuse , but also on orders of politicians and security forces who put together with organised crime under a ceiling . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Media W@@ aters group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 &quot; has more than half of the attacks on police officers and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die , because they would like to hold the mouth , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot;
obviously the murders have a terrible effect .
nobody forget the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; your body was found together with a note that was report@@ edly signed by Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
&quot; a computer keyboard and head@@ phone , beside her separated head . &quot;
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in northern border State Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assassination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ro@@ sl@@ ava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do such as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of their director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez publicly created the drug cart@@ el with an editorial on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want of us ? &quot;
some journalists fled from their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and are looking for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are ch@@ ased , as evi@@ den@@ ced to the photographer of Reuben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was assassin@@ ated three months along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who remain back and continue working , it is a daily dance with risk @-@ rich decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be poet , indicates that the drug traff@@ icking is troubled . &quot;
&quot; Mexico is going to hell , and therefore I became reporter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk before the office and drank beer , when all their teleph@@ ones began to sum@@ s up . &quot;
a series of shooting @-@ paintings with belt ri@@ val@@ ents and security forces near the bathing area of Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
&quot; the war continued , as promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region . &quot;
from the Bord@@ stein@@ kan@@ te they have published the latest news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ ce via mobile .
the front page had to be changed next day .
si@@ r@@ ens he@@ ats close to - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who held guard to see if they were in read@@ iness .
&quot; when they were afraid at all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his tracks . &quot;
&quot; how can you only think of thinking , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; if the same day that Javier was murdered , the practition@@ er asked me to send them on the road to the road . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ouflage to ev@@ ade his enemies
&quot; at first glance , it looks like a statue , though a sc@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; now , researchers found that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ oc@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian mountain worker were so well preserved that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was so well preserved that they even could find that his fl@@ ak@@ y skin was the red@@ dish of Braun - and they said they had something from a &quot; wrong past . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described him as &quot; the preserved din@@ osau@@ rs din@@ osau@@ rs ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs specimens of the world . &quot;
&quot; the fossil is a newly discovered kind of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , who lived in the middle of the chal@@ k time between 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot;
&quot; his incredibly well @-@ persistent condition , researchers , who describe it as &quot; really remarkable &quot; , &quot;
&quot; according to reports , in National Ge@@ ographic , the mo@@ red plant @-@ gl@@ aciers is the best preserved F@@ ossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Shawn Funk , when he took place on March 21 , 2011 at Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the North of Alberta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; he hit something that appeared from the surrounding rock at the Plat@@ ze , and decided to look closely . &quot;
it was discovered by him F@@ ossil sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you only blin@@ king a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it was asleep , &quot; &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creation has to be seen . &quot;
it will go to the scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa the din@@ osau@@ rs .
&quot; researchers found out that this plant @-@ gl@@ utt@@ ons , although it is covered with a arm@@ our and resem@@ bles a convertible tanks , probably threatened by flesh @-@ car@@ ni@@ rs din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the strong din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide themselves before car@@ ni@@ es , and used a par@@ ach@@ able technology that is known as counter@@ att@@ acking , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this could have been allowed to mix much better in its surroundings and to avoid his enemies , experts say that it was threatened by greater din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made headlines in May and is now seen in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal , and it was called Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ elli after the museum techn@@ ician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that had spent more than 7.000 hours in order to expos@@ e it carefully . &quot;
&quot; amazing conservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and form of shed and arm@@ aments about his body . &quot;
&quot; they discovered the sha@@ dy , a widespread defense method in the animal , meaning that the top of the creature dar@@ ker was as their under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the Con@@ vey@@ or is common , the results are surprising because the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far the animals live today . &quot;
&quot; it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by sufficient pressures through meat @-@ res din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution of the con@@ frontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use the sha@@ dy , think about Re@@ he , Zeb@@ ras or Ar@@ ma@@ ids - are much smaller and inj@@ uri@@ ous as a prey , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real battle for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behaviour on a massive , heavily ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r pre@@ dat@@ or of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous must have been &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ rs ro@@ red was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal on critics , including his preserved Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ tes to figure out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , caught up into a river and went out into the sea , where he fell on the back to the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alberta was so warm like South @-@ flu@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans now spread much further inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with con@@ front@@ al skin but also in three dimensions , and the original form of the animal ret@@ ains , &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal today looks almost exactly as in the early chal@@ k period .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use much fantasy , to re@@ construct it . if you &apos;re just a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is asleep . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k time was a time when huge thermal periods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , stood on two legs , covered the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , Ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ aurus Rex , million years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted from some of his terrible ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tonnes heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , their latest insights in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta after death sank into the sea and sw@@ apped up in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Shawn Funk , when he took place on March 21 , 2011 at Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the North of Alberta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the din@@ osau@@ rs din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ our , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hips . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) . &quot;
&quot; it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips , which ra@@ zed from his shoulders . &quot;
&quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mo@@ red plant @-@ gl@@ aciers was sho@@ cked through the western Canada , until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea . &quot;
but the din@@ osau@@ rs of the din@@ osau@@ rs keep his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
&quot; the lim@@ estone remains of this particular specimen is so well preserved , that the hood still cover hol@@ low tank plates along the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , is such a level of preser@@ ving so &apos; rare like a win in l@@ otto . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it , the conf@@ using it will . &quot;
&quot; the remn@@ ants of the skin still cover the hol@@ low tank plates , which wear the skull of the beast . &quot;
&quot; his right front foot lies on his side , his five fingers crossed on top . &quot;
I can count the she@@ ds at its sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age on A8 : many injured
on Thursday evening on the A8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age .
there are numerous injured and frozen pieces - and G@@ aff@@ er .
&quot; on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , on the late Thursday morning , around 20 people were injured by a mass ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age . &quot;
&quot; according to the first data of the police at 17.00 , between the connection points Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) , during a thunder@@ storm about 30 vehicles , among them probably trucks , in@@ mates . &quot;
&quot; over the exact number of the injured persons , no information at first . &quot;
&quot; the action was light up to moderate injuries , said a police raid . &quot;
a great essay to rescue vehicles was at the accident point .
the A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
&quot; in the district of Munich , approximately ten kilometres of long recovery was formed . &quot;
like an AZ reporter reports it on the counter @-@ way to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
&quot; the fire@@ fighters not@@ ched the label of the vehicle manufacturers , which now have to calculate with sensitive issues . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 the second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
it was a coll@@ ision between an auto @-@ transporter and a passenger car .
a b@@ ail@@ out helicopter was on the road to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
&quot; it is a moment that almost everyone else experienced : nothing really sits in the train and sleeps . &quot;
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ ers .
&quot; comes the Schaff@@ ner , and w@@ akes up an unclean , or breaks the gli@@ ast from the middle of the workflow . &quot;
ticket inspection control .
but the times of breaks are over soon .
&quot; at present , the Deutsche Bahn test@@ et is the most creative vehicle control . &quot;
&quot; it is simple , simply by mobile phone , taken the ticket to take away the ticket . &quot;
currently a test run on two routes .
&quot; comes the offer , wide we recommend it . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to be available in Germany at the beginning of the year , on many other remote transport routes in Germany , &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; is called by train the ticket recovery without Schaff@@ ner .
&quot; to use the use , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to have an online ticket - what &apos;s going to do most passengers already .
&quot; it also has to have purchased the app by rail , DB Navigator , which is the most convenient type of the ticket booking anyway . &quot;
and last one needs a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works so : you get into the train , calling its ticket by &quot; &quot; My tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with the test customers , a button on the electronic de@@ valuation appears . &quot;
the train managers get a message that driving g@@ ast X is located in the train and taken the booked seat field Y .
&quot; the train manager is responsible for the ticket inspection at room Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already de@@ vis@@ able online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue , keep silent . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for rail , which is to take advantage of the passengers . &quot;
&quot; who wants to travel without ticket monitoring through our train accompanying personnel , check in the DB navig@@ ator itself . &quot;
&quot; this allows the passengers to design their travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing @-@ Management of DB Fern@@ traffic . &quot;
second Plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to enter the individual customer needs .
&quot; if you are often running , know that beside the delay and missed ways , the ticket inspec@@ tions are among the greatest off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; for often , in any case , however , one of the trav@@ ellers do not need all documents related to the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
either is missing the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document that you must show .
&quot; the result are endless discussions between train leaders and driving force , which leads to worse mood in the part or large area and del@@ ays in control of your own tickets and the Schaff@@ ner takes the time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
&quot; and that &apos;s just on the links ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 , Stuttgart @-@ Essen . &quot;
other train numbers on the same track are not un@@ locked .
how a activist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ?
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken up to their core . &quot;
&quot; just one day after she had arrived in New York City , the apartment was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that rented and sc@@ roll@@ te through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it still stands on the road , &quot; was called it there . &quot;
&quot; confused , since nobody else had posted the information on their feed , she completed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly prayed for their tim@@ eline .
&quot; Rap@@ per from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed live . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s le@@ blo@@ om body which was stretched out on the road and stay there four hours .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; she thought to Fer@@ rell . &quot;
but death was not new for her and her community .
&quot; she finished her mobile phone , to twe@@ ets to Twe@@ et over people on the Can@@ field Drive . &quot;
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people who cried out , and from a man who claimed to be a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they watched a live feed in which a polic@@ eman stood before a group of protest@@ ers with a bell@@ ate dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , assured a different polic@@ eman and cried : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell remin@@ ded their statement . &quot;
&quot; this is not the kind of murder , to which we have used to us and that we can name typical . &quot;
&quot; at this moment , I felt ch@@ ills . &quot;
I was angry and wept . &quot;
&quot; she booked a return flight , and went home the next day . &quot;
&quot; after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on in the next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; in cinemas as of September 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the sight of human beings , living in the community and have filled the streets to challenge answers . &quot;
&quot; as a fer@@ rell with her daughter , which carried a flower dress and a suitable crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two are a conversation , which they had countless times before this morning &quot; over the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I have taught you , when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; remember what she said . &quot;
&quot; we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not bring them away , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
what happened today is a highlight of it ... what happened in the past .
&quot; it must know , and see it , and it will be tu@@ cked up . &quot;
&quot; it must be well developed , not only acti@@ vism and organization , but also know the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to free to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have lucky enough to give you an experience , in which she personally experienced no ek@@ lat@@ ent rac@@ ism , it is no different than the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would have a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot;
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police station that was at a camp site when the activists on the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson waited . &quot;
there Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags before and helped to pass on demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; slowly , a new type of acti@@ vism began to take shape . &quot;
&quot; after August 9 , my acti@@ vism has changed , &quot; &quot; she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority student N@@ ur@@ se Association , and focused on food and health ine@@ qualities in black congregations . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in the organisation .
it has come all . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , a co @-@ director of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r wanted only &quot; document &quot; what happened .
a question came to Fer@@ rell in the meaning : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ?
&quot; this scep@@ tic@@ ism was nourished by countless inst@@ ances of people , often by white - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and their resistance . &quot;
&quot; as fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; &quot; We had heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised their voices , and we wanted to make it different . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is well known for its acti@@ vism around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ ct . &quot;
his commitment brought Fer@@ rell &apos;s project closer together with six other natives followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Bro@@ wns path@@ way .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking to us . we speak , &quot; &quot; Davis said . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are presented , because I will be presented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to focus on Fer@@ rel@@ ls &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a m@@ essi@@ ah leader , but for a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it turned out to be the most obvious participants in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls life , as she loves to love and marry her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed , when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
&quot; but I understood that there must be certain injuries at this work , and in the violation of black people . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls history is repe@@ ating the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who identified the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as a gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are fighting to different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; the movement truly is maintained by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is no affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; in which Fer@@ rell has chosen as a heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who came up for this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no coincidence , although it was at the front , because with a life on these cru@@ ises as a black , gay woman is so much in the game . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have disappeared , but the r@@ att@@ itudes between the church and the police continue . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a motorway at a demonstration .
she describes the social atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless she cl@@ ung to a song and she feels committed to this memory , since they entered into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago . &quot;
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love one another .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; magn@@ itude &quot; : TV readers discuss about Bit Gallery
&quot; the Bit Gallery moves the people , although it is not yet built long . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping center on the outskirts of the pedestrian zone has been un@@ folded since the first presentation of 2009 the population in supporters and opponents .
cold the subject could hardly be one .
the theme is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; .
&quot; while those who say to the Bit Gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; That &apos;s real &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; don &apos;t need a man &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ aking ) or simply : &quot; &quot; magn@@ itude ! &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot;
&quot; while the supporters build that a gallery contains more customers in the city , of which the other businesses benefit , the enemies fear that the pedestrian zone den@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; on the premises : the gallery is planned , on which the peas@@ ant market stands , in which 13 direct mark@@ eters offer their products . &quot;
&quot; with the beginning of the construction , it will end . &quot;
the gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - as a place for Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with the possibility of sitting outside .
Simone rooms : &quot; we &apos;ve been buying a weekly market in the peas@@ ant market for many years .
&quot; mostly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm women are always happy again . &quot;
we have also discovered the but@@ cher for us .
we would like to wish that during and above all after the construction of the gallery a chance to maintain this offer .
&quot; in other cities , there is also . &quot;
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting .
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; if direct mark@@ er in a market hall in the gallery arrives at the amount of rent .
but that should not be low for the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what is the most shopping mall in bit@@ burg ?
&quot; clothes , shoes , dr@@ ones or supermarkets : I find the superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there is enough in our city .
you can see how many shop stores are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but here , however , there is not once a regular weekly market , it is the more important that at least the Market Hall remains at least . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there is fresh , mostly offered by the producer , and is completely priced . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , shop transactions are rented in a shopping center only by larger companies , because the bre@@ ads are often not portable for one retail@@ er . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special stores , there are almost no more and what is left , will van@@ ish even though . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit me together .
and the gallery does not fit bit@@ burg .
above all : where is the peas@@ ant market during the construction time ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even on the duration if the Bit Gallery is actually coming .
or does it create the g@@ hosts Bit Gallery previously to drive all shops from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that will not work .
&quot; and a shopping center that is empty , no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery . &quot;
but for a peas@@ ant hall it &apos;s thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - sensu@@ al building projects in bit@@ burg is no more space .
&quot; when the peas@@ ant hall kap@@ ok , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York many faces can be seen - white , black and brown that are almost un@@ noticeable - which hang on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and hair@@ styles that were sent from Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent a 35 @-@ year @-@ old sentence from prison in Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where she made a 35 @-@ year @-@ old sentence after she publicly made diplomatic news on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( An appropriate simil@@ arity ) .
&quot; it is the product of two years correspon@@ dent between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was established in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ wife and breaking dis@@ sid@@ y , whose conviction of Barack Obama was only three days later . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis and created out of the 30 portraits , like someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could not only look for the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many wise men , such as they can be interpreted and the tough@@ ness determin@@ ism of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Bradley Edward , has been openly pronounced on the identification as wife , has been sentenced to 20 years in 2013 , including six violations of the sp@@ ying law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; by the prison her picture was supp@@ ressed , so very that there was only one photo - a grain , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which man@@ ing is deliberately situated on a driver &apos;s seat , which has been associated with them . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came just from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
&quot; in this , the artist portra@@ yed portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts like a cig@@ ar enst@@ um@@ mel and che@@ wing gum by extra@@ cting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of that people might look like . &quot;
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg with a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not visit at that time and could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea , and asked her if she wanted a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and their incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were sent to un@@ equal letters , who replaced several letters in the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; even they were created by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o Illu@@ stri@@ erte Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ressed images , &quot; which would fore@@ see a future and would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; Obama actually had just a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome kind of happy meetings . &quot;
&quot; there is also a little depth and Star@@ kes , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ aking ways to fix the rigid divisions that he actually should fix . &quot;
&quot; as De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , after a strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen out of a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in one of the Gallery of the Gallery , Mann@@ ing called for her superior signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in their family names ) an end of the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation which have been the basis of gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , its mit@@ ochondri@@ al DNA sequence is a thou@@ ght@@ ful of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide according to the highly developed scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) , as surprisingly similar , at least in biological ways we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people hopefully bring to them , is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care about who we are and how openly genetic data for a interpretation and how sub@@ jective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , too . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell you so many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic Nov@@ elle . &quot;
&quot; it shows Mann@@ ing , how it appears with a hands of hands in the hand of the United States , like King Kong . &quot;
&quot; if they ch@@ ill your word , then they have won , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so never leave the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who greetings from Philadelphia . &quot;
&quot; I still get ge@@ ared , if I speak about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was supposed to be seen in the comic book - but if they should do it then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by their own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ ul@@ ators who gather together like hor@@ des of protest@@ ers .
&quot; that was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing st@@ ature ) , where their genetic h@@ aul was written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past , I had her on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd of lives , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed itself with Chelsea , like the movement , which were also behind their liberation . &quot;
Professor of North@@ western University and a employee at the University of Oxford for murder
&quot; a nationwide human @-@ hunt is in progress for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , having been looking to susp@@ ects a man in a luxury apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries . &quot;
&quot; on Monday were issued on Monday for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) , for murder of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the district court of Cook County . &quot;
&quot; documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
a public warning system issued by a police authority in Chicago declared that the body was discovered on July 27 .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim of several injuries on his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared on the site of the event for dead , and det@@ ective investig@@ ating the bul@@ che as murder , while the police actively searched for the two susp@@ ects . &quot;
L@@ ath@@ em has been an extraordinary professor for micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em was now being judged in assessment and from entering the campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal matter which was investigated by the competent authorities , and North@@ western University co@@ operated on this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
&quot; a spokes@@ man of the university and the Gra@@ ville College said in an E @-@ Mail Declaration , that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK in contact and ready to help US investig@@ ative authorities in any way . &quot;
&quot; the asser@@ tion , added that War@@ ning &apos;s colleagues were sho@@ cked and want to himself . &quot;
&quot; chief Communications Officer of the Chicago authority , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he needed to susp@@ ect the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their residence , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building which had just received a r@@ ins@@ ing tip , who said that in apartment 10@@ 08 something happened . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it is un@@ clear , whether the incident occurred on July 27 . &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot;
&quot; Grand Plaza &apos;s management team published an explanation of the residents : &quot; the police currently works on the time axis and the background of the victim and explo@@ res a variety of moti@@ ves , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - the Russian Viz@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
the Russian Viz@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t last long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for recovery of the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of the meeting , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with Ukrain ( UK anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this regard , &quot; Mut@@ ko declared on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second leg of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the code , which describes the criteria for re @-@ establishment of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t contain anything that could give a concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria mentioned in the list mentioned , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities approved the reported results of the WA@@ DA by Canadian attorney Richard McLaren to alleged government @-@ sponsored D@@ op@@ ings in Russian sport . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we lead the examination as our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has failed . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not admit something that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ ual words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission . &quot;
&quot; speaking with the Russian sales station R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v claimed problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; nobody has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in the wake of D@@ oping Sk@@ and@@ als from D@@ oping control in Russia in November 2015 .
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan testing and coordin@@ ate tests under international experts and the UK anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; following a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Director Olivier Nig@@ gl@@ i declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves into the right direction to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di sell no eggs for the first time .
this divided the corporate groups .
&quot; it &apos;s a pure precau@@ tionary measure , it could further be assumed of no health impair@@ ment , it was told in the message . &quot;
&quot; from now on , only eggs are needed to be supplied to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested negative at fixed anti @-@ domestic anti @-@ domestic animals . &quot;
Al@@ di wants to produce clarity and transparency to its customers .
start @-@ ups that will help your company will not become the next u@@ ber
&quot; Amy deliver@@ t wanted to measure the luck in your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the p@@ olls did not work . &quot;
&quot; responses were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; even if you promised an@@ ony@@ m@@ ity , some workers do not mourn before the trial . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; said salvation , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed . &quot;
it has been sum@@ mon@@ ed people from the outside .
a new race of human resources start @-@ ups is at the wa@@ xing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licens@@ ing software that has the specific purpose of the monitoring of employees , it enables companies to conduct surveys , Special groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases , W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to handle the C @-@ suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; they now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools are used to measure employees . &quot;
&quot; deliver a better insight into what your staff think , and feel at G@@ lin@@ t in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the S@@ nap @-@ surveys and surveys from certain teams , it offers a heat @-@ map of the company that shows most complaints and which executives can have low influ@@ x results , so that you can drill . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , you will not have to stay in sc@@ and@@ als , that a former employee has published a blog post since then a former employee has published a blog post , where those who have talked to be punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups like g@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility . &quot;
&quot; the global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion worth , according to the financial technical website let &apos;s talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Denver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ t , the company helps to prevent bad behavior and recognize , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ diagnosis . &quot;
&quot; convertible has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla . &quot;
u@@ ber signed up recently as a client .
&quot; like g@@ lin@@ t , convert Conver@@ t companies tailored &quot; Pul@@ s- &quot; p@@ olls , to collect confi@@ dential answers in real time and view the heat @-@ cards of your problem . &quot;
&quot; it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , which can report a bad behavior . &quot;
&quot; once the chief executive manager is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the public opinion has recorded the Reg@@ ul@@ ators &quot; , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , founder and managing director of Conver@@ t . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that his staff is badly treated or im@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences by consumers boy@@ cott , workers &quot; approach and complaints , &quot; said Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25.000 employees and more than 500 sites , has been used for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier , when a employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company &apos;s headquarters , a formal appeal , and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often an in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said it was no good opportunity to follow the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company Conver@@ t sets , problems that were previously identified by executives , which were hidden in offices in cities or states , were identified - like discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or illeg@@ ally intern@@ ships . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holi@@ stic , 360 degree view from experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders , prior to employment . &quot;
&quot; companies began to take ethics , values and employees in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collapsed because of ethical violations of the Enron scandal , Quin@@ lan said . &quot;
&quot; but it took until the &quot; soci@@ etal media came to their right &quot; , &quot; that companies knew that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; prior to use of technology to monitor ethics , people used hope than any strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ t provide your software as service , and load the companies with recur@@ ring fees for use of their products . &quot;
&quot; it is a business model and a chance that finds the approval of Venture Capital investors , which both supports start @-@ ups . &quot;
&quot; convert $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the entire capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
Gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November of Bess@@ emer &apos;s venture and brought his entire financing to $ 60 million .
&quot; this investment is hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees are expecting more than previously . &quot;
&quot; in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high salary and interesting projects are only bet@@ s . &quot;
the employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that &apos;s worth their voices , and that the work you do is worth it , then feel more strongly to make this company successful , &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience . &quot;
&quot; investors reach pensions , when their portfolio is well run . companies run well when employees are working and involved . &quot;
&quot; if the Analytics tools promise third @-@ party commitment , commitment and the use of employees , it is no wonder you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee @-@ commitment according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
&quot; however , the data are us@@ eless if the administrator of a company should not take action . &quot;
&quot; in fact , when a company asks employees according to your feedback , it may have an anticip@@ ation that the change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change is not fast enough , or at all , this dis@@ appointments and employees can de@@ motiv@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be willing to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the business management company Kot@@ ter International , which has seen itself to feel very much to collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you don &apos;t follow , you &apos;re asking me , &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t worry about , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Madison Reed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to introduce measures on the same day when a problem about G@@ lin@@ t is reported to be saved . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was capable of organizing several teams within the company and to add a communications training to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; in Ruby Tuesday , the company will always get new insights about the staff , and it hopes that a long point of view , this leads to a better binding of workers in a branch , which is well @-@ known for high revenues . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose man , you will also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , you will lose company . &quot;
the N@@ CAA removes the two @-@ day practice and makes a long day for Bru@@ ins
it goes on 23 o &apos;clock as a lot of U@@ CL@@ A @-@ Foot@@ wear players on a page of the new exercise fields of the team on campus .
some have gone out their tri@@ cot kern@@ els and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , they represent an lunch break . &quot;
players who are inscri@@ bed on the summer courses will return after the three hour exercise to their final exam before they return at 6 : 30 am to the Water@@ man Football Center .
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real t@@ ret@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday to Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ CL@@ A will start at 7 : 15 p.m. to meet the player &apos;s fully @-@ extra@@ cting players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than a day , at which Bru@@ ins moved to the beginning of the camps almost a week after the last season , during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six game times in West@@ wood . &quot;
they should keep doing exercises in the course of August 18 . 20 before the start of the formula preparations for the start of Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; MOR@@ A said that he supports the change of the N@@ CAA support , even if they added a second point of players . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous load three or four days on them , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; and they have done it simply , they are plac@@ eable , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we will have more time , it will really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practice as soon as the camp is finished , in view of the clear sigh@@ ting of its fields from a neighbouring car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the elevated class , which is already admitted to foot@@ balls , which will be no easy task . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our safety , &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far to think that people rent a room there and then set to draw a practice there . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video and of a practice , it is a pretty good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
so I &apos;m not worried too much .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against fake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counterfeit entries to third parties and their results below the original entry then said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News .
&quot; the company said in an opinion on his website , that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to recognize possible detection is to be seen , which may indicate results of fact testing from the original article . &quot;
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main focus points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News . many believed that they also have influenced US presidential elections in 2016 .
&quot; the problem has become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters that over@@ flooded the presidential elections in May with wrong stories , and Germany will support a plan according to the social media networks , if it does not succeed , filled Post@@ ings like before the elections there in September quickly . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate explanation in German , that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany will be a test of the new facts testing . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the realization of the fact that stories of fact exagger@@ ated third parties , people want to meet more context to make profound decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook continues to test his feature to the &quot; &quot; test &quot; &quot; and to other changes to its news feed to reduce false news . &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze music video and was for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ er and 1980 @-@ 1980 a si@@ p@@ hole .
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history at the Be@@ wl River valley in K@@ ent and is now inspiration for an graphic novel of Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England needs the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another , rising British artist , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection which was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was un@@ expect@@ edly emotional . &quot;
&quot; I have only responded to the thum@@ b pressure on the page of a letter that was written by a double victory in the 1700 @-@ s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; this is his thum@@ b pressure !
&quot; and letters still smell of smoke , because then one was lit a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has a effect as he himself would be . &quot;
&quot; Ah , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who , so with old papers , he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and lived for nearly four months in a castle ( &quot; &quot; To be honest : I have forgotten my welcome gru@@ dge &quot; ) , that &apos;s all too beautiful to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , to fore@@ see the archives and had the many treasures and curi@@ os@@ ities of the castle , such as the mon@@ ished hy@@ m@@ heads in walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emigrated through the grounds and ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landscape care , gar@@ den@@ ers , and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank of &quot; Whis@@ key and began writing . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust received the full access in 2006 , when the final Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des met a decade later , the staff only started to take care of the archive that he said than &quot; &quot; hundreds of years , in which arist@@ oc@@ rates said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English emp@@ ires , maps that represent what he had : &quot; you could mean that land conflicts could be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot;
&quot; guys , let all of them go ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to illustr@@ ate a wider basis in the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who leaves the newly built castle to join the farmer rose from 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a stir that occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly family of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot;
&quot; the farmer arose in this area and I thought , a revol@@ t was a good start . &quot;
perhaps the two are connected together ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the history of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rons , which had been hidden for seven years during the English re@@ formation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , portra@@ yed at the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th century , who filled his own funeral by filled a sar@@ g with stones ( a discovery that was discovered only years later ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; gent@@ lemen seemed to be quite a good mood , getting there again and spend money for things that they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men extingu@@ ishes their school@@ ing , by experiencing rich ancient women - I imagine it as a he@@ ap of well @-@ looking boys , with a talent to wer@@ ve land@@ lords . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his use in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique scre@@ am experiences &quot;

but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;

campaign launched : more than 300 years old Mari@@ us@@ elle covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the reduction of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Lady &apos;s chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started off their campaign to launch a new roof brand ( Rundschau of Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF wants to keep the logo and his marketing team by Nelson Art@@ z . &quot;
&quot; at the end of August , there will be a celebration on the island Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th island . &quot;
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? , &quot; ask the makers of the promotion since yesterday on posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) do not really , write it on its yesterday available web site . &quot;
but we use this measure to win your attention .
&quot; and to make clear that much better is , than it seems . &quot;
&quot; basically , we are the firm conviction that we considered a bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer to know beauty and attra@@ cti@@ veness of our city . &quot;
&quot; with the action it will go more than &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , &quot; it continues . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a true promise , one that gives the city a distinctive unique feature . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in the competition with other municipalities . &quot;
the city Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f leaves their new roof @-@ brand and cost the campaign in the next five @-@ digit amount .
military re@@ forming in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan fear of the army
&quot; each year at the beginning of August , in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) advis@@ es over retirement and transport in the officer . &quot;
this is how this week .
at first glance a normal operation .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was not held in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but in the Prime Minister &apos;s Office . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of government , five Vice Premier@@ s , as well as the Minister for Defence , Interior , Justice and Foreign Affairs . &quot;
so the civilians were in the Y@@ as in the over@@ number .
the government moves the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; chief Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were de@@ posed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed Cou@@ p , state of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of 326 gener@@ als and ad@@ miral . &quot;
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the army from the army - mostly due to alleged connections on the movement of exile @-@ pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erdo@@ gan of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; this week , against 4@@ 86 people , who are directly involved in the coup attempt , has been negoti@@ ating in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan described the overthrow of &quot; God &apos;s gift &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to clean the armed forces . &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan is really a handle in the army ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ eas@@ iness &quot; in the military headquarters . &quot;
&quot; in the general staff there is Bes@@ gian , because of an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , manifest@@ ing itself among others in the lifting of the head ban for solo@@ ists , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the mag@@ ist@@ em@@ blem@@ an in the army and the security forces go on . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan dismissed another 73@@ 95 state operators , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers . &quot;
&quot; it seemed , when Erdo@@ gan is t@@ amed the military . &quot;
the gener@@ als g@@ old earlier than the masters of the country .
three times she p@@ utsch@@ es her role as gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the world leaders .
&quot; following his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed the power by the military step by step , not least calling for the reform of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is primarily an Islam@@ ist of armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; a well @-@ called officer , who sought asylum in the coup attempt in fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; in a few years . &quot;
&quot; meets this , NATO could not let such developments cold . &quot;
&quot; anyway , there are doubts about the ac@@ credit@@ ation of the Turkish Army in the Alliance after the ac@@ credit@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational abilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; NATO diplom@@ ats say . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media . &quot;
&quot; he looks ahead to lower the legal immig@@ rant to 50,000 a year , stri@@ cter rules for the request of visa for a temporary work permit and restrictions for families @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , save wages and billion dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by the US will change the way by citizens from other countries &apos; Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new candidate procedure will benefit the candidates who will speak English to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit from our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to shuttle the road to racing traffic
&quot; again , over the past few months over the future of the racing @-@ sh@@ utt@@ les had been fought - now it should be very fast . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the year , the railway line will be built on which the tourist road runs . &quot;
&quot; to secure the future of the traffic light in the long term , we should start construction work on the track according to the public ministry . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to order and to renov@@ ate the route Il@@ men@@ au race , the country is particularly important for the tourism key , &quot; declared Road State Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;
the costs for the maintenance of the track was reduced to about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country transfers 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , based on which the Shuttle will also be ordered in the future of the country , will definitely be matched , stated S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the South of the Southern Rail@@ ways are already one of the technical details already .
&quot; the tim@@ etable , the vehicles and quality standards are negotiated , said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the Railway Society will be closed for a period of eleven years .
the race track should be ordered at the end of December 2017 .
the race shuttle is an especially popular rail link between railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ es .
&quot; over the past few months , in the course of a pilot company had been tested , whether the distance of sufficient many people will be used to order them again in the future . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the track is badly damaged in parts . &quot;
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about .
&quot; just as you thought that in 2017 there is no more crazy , a new report about the technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big thing .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , emer@@ itus professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founders of FR@@ R , we must start taking their ascent seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eyel@@ ids of the robot , its form of ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of finger@@ nail . &quot;
&quot; people are funny about it , but the companies deliver a lot of them , and we will see them much more frequently to see , &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key on the release of his new report . &quot;
&quot; modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin , which feels warm - with conscious human reactions , which can be achieved through artificial intelligence . &quot;
&quot; the user can custom@@ ize its robots , according to his belie@@ fs , and choose everything from the eye color of the robot through the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his finger@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; but there is still wor@@ r@@ ative , as many robots possess &quot; personalities &quot; that would have a Step@@ ford @-@ wife progressive . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed to robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; the Real@@ Bot@@ ix robot allows an example to custom@@ ize its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they are attractive , such as ti@@ ap@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there &apos;s the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion , such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; who convey@@ s the impression of ti@@ redness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; war@@ ts the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; during the day , it also has its mood - very like real people ! &quot;
&quot; you can be tired , being fixed on conversation , or she can &quot; be &quot; in mood . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are many wor@@ r@@ ative aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ ce@@ ful female properties , the swelling on rape when you encounter a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is here : resi@@ dency ) Far@@ rah , be@@ qui@@ l one most . &quot;
&quot; on his website , true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a table or just another sex toys . &quot;
&quot; their orig@@ ination and their increasing refin@@ ement indicate a bit dar@@ ker and deep refin@@ ement in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire to sex with sub@@ jection as an optional en@@ core . &quot;
&quot; most men , of course , do not keep sex robots , and while the FR@@ R not@@ ices its rising popularity , they are still temporary on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what le@@ ak@@ ened out of the Rand@@ om zones can be in terms of the spirit of the time , in which we are living , very educational . &quot;
&quot; and many people are not strange , or ins@@ ulting , until they charge the free market for this . &quot;
&quot; there is a certain over@@ l@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots are threatened with a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House to have attacked women sexually attacked . &quot;
&quot; the most terrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the hand@@ maid &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the swallowed of un@@ affected bodies , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump . &quot;
&quot; the goal behind these sex robots , there is a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star proportions ) . &quot;
&quot; their builder , they want to feel decent that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body . &quot;
&quot; but , when it comes to the point , the robots are not a real women . &quot;
they can &apos;t separate or simply move away from their companion .
&quot; they have no placement or background history , nothing that could distur@@ b on independence or something , which could distur@@ b the fantasy of total sub@@ jection . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are counterfeit slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the language of 2017 : service cities
tr@@ um@@ ps great power ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the ep@@ it@@ ome of the healthy human being
&quot; it is become a Bin@@ sen@@ we@@ ish@@ ness of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions , which have polarized US voters , have also divided families in small @-@ format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Ern@@ est ank@@ le , there were newspapers in the United States newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ elected relatives . &quot;
we all allegedly strict us to burst our filter bub@@ bles .
&quot; less noticed is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , families to bring together . &quot;
&quot; I mention this because my cousin , a le@@ aning @-@ le@@ aning , who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
they remembered that unity against a common enemy may have a powerful effect .
&quot; with tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows it , including the republi@@ can relationship , fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side . &quot;
&quot; around the dining table , it is certainly a good thing , but it falls to me in a further context that this is also considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the Left Party was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the satisfactory effect of his presidency has the power to slide all of us to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ us@@ al possibility that we will no longer be to@@ wed in the bi@@ b of one day . &quot;
&quot; however , there is still a long @-@ frigh@@ tened long time scenario , norm@@ alized in the Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as an ep@@ it@@ ome of del@@ ine@@ quality . &quot;
&quot; today I find myself from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s official version of Ver@@ de@@ ers - the dog on the car roof that looked at 14 % of income tax ( but at least we knew , as his tax returns ) - both in comparison to tr@@ ump in fact a very mild crimes . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump is going , the next candidate of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be mentally healthy to qualify as an un@@ measur@@ able improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my cousin in the city was , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ uss@@ el &apos;s Park department , and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need a caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs in the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cr@@ un@@ ky and the animals rotate to look full of their own shoulders - extremely fin@@ ster , and the lim@@ iting music is giving them on strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings will become old , the Sky@@ lines will be familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and reality of the city becomes the dream not . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not quite about the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the Them@@ es @-@ Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sel is still a strange experience , as here two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women can go to the 40 @-@ year @-@ old and have all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I had to evaluate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one has asked . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced into a department store in this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of up to five stars before I could move my credit card . &quot;
&quot; at the corner of my street , it is the same thing , plus the option to compens@@ ate with a 15 % tip - this to get something about the shop . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also does a pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation , in which no required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman at the department store stood exc@@ o@@ ily , while I made tired of the experience to submit my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain from the prison to the hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
&quot; last year , he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of car@@ riages in the hospital , which he suffered the prison authorities according to a case in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to murder in prison for murder after murder of the pro@@ secut@@ ors .
&quot; he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of the Valentine &apos;s early morning in 2013 , taking them several times by a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he had kept his girlfriend for a no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal int@@ ru@@ der that hid himself in the cabin .
&quot; the pro@@ secut@@ ors have announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say she is too hard . &quot;
&quot; the National Prosecutor of Justice said that it will be objec@@ ted to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objec@@ tion could be heard in this year . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is in danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the pro@@ secut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold a strange egg is found
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ quarters were fired from feeding and ec@@ cent@@ en@@ ho@@ fen and moved into the local schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the students will go to the high school , four at the school . &quot;
school teacher Angel@@ ika S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Mayor Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
&quot; as a symbol for the school release , the 29 students of the four classes voted by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ des a young eag@@ les that grows in chicken yard , but then in freedom is released . &quot;
&quot; in addition to this , the m@@ lower ch@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle at the poultry farm . &quot; &quot;
&quot; farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it from his chicken . &quot;
&quot; instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope of making a chicken cut off from him , the eag@@ les spread out its wings on a high mountain . &quot;
&quot; after that , classes were three and four in the study of Y@@ vonne Frank found a chicken dance . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , the cylinder bore to bet . &quot;
&quot; the eagle stand for integration , said school guide Angel@@ ika S@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the young may be different from the other young ( ch@@ icks ) , but belong to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his provision is to be free .
they wish every fourth cl@@ avi@@ ator that he feels himself in his new school .
&quot; afterwards , Dan@@ kes@@ word followed the colleagues at the former school director Michael Müller , who always jumps again with the lessons of lessons , and the par@@ ental advoc@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; now the cooking time is over , the class Sophia Schumacher declared . &quot;
&quot; they leave their pupils after two years of teaching , because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the vier@@ lander . &quot;
&quot; in conclusion , all students made a song of summer time and holiday periods . &quot;
&quot; with the children , there broke great joy . &quot;
eight first students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians imprisoned in Greece because of illegal camp@@ ings in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of 1 August , Si@@ th@@ onia was arrested by the police in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released , while currently an investigation is running . &quot;
the State Department reported B@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians was later released .
&quot; the Greek authorities have lost control of the free camping and place every one that is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , that is not intended for this purpose . &quot;

the ministry said that the court can be fin@@ ed a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what do the victims need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers in a glance .
&quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars . &quot;
&quot; they should improve the emission of emission classes of Euro 5 , and partly Euro 6 . &quot;
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or poor are exemp@@ ted .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin of ACE car Club Europe gives ass@@ ess@@ ments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no . the updated software updates are voluntary .
&quot; the oblig@@ atory updates will only apply to those who have Schumann software , &quot; An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
the re@@ armament has ordered the Federal Office of the Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced a high @-@ level implementation in the coming months , but not called any exact date . &quot;
Daimler has communic@@ ated to write each affected .
&quot; if that &apos;s due to an inspection , it will be done in their frame . &quot;
how long will the equipment pull out in total ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
the curtains of the manufacturer &apos;s commitment and political pressure .
&quot; for we have seen , voluntarily act the car manufacturers at the topic environment so far not . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the change@@ over itself could last three to four hours in the workshop .
time consuming could be to get an appointment .
&quot; drive to drivers who do not drive a car by BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group ? &quot;
the ACE should wait for him .
&quot; probably , foreign manufacturers would be tra@@ pped , so S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
is a massive price drop of Euro @-@ 4 cars now ?
the ACE fears this .
&quot; but in the regions where passengers were dro@@ pping . &quot;
&quot; in rural area , there is no loss for older diesel . &quot;
the ACE is advis@@ able to wait with a sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center award

we do the city alive
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes into retirement next year . &quot;
&quot; the site is already written - suitable candidates , however , are rare . &quot;
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister for 31 years .
and the work still makes it great fun as he medi@@ ates in the press conference .
&quot; it reports varied , but also demanding tasks that wait for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it ad@@ mi@@ red that so far no application might be fulfilled the requirement profile . &quot;
&quot; the city is looking for an architect , architects , or construction engineer at the next time . &quot;
so - under cont@@ emp@@ t of regular Termin@@ ation periods - still have enough time to work .
&quot; since Has@@ lach , for the administration community , acts as a sub @-@ governing authority , the applicant must refer to the respective connections . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; would they not be able to fill it more , they would have to drive citizens to counsel@@ ing up to Offen@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; but the proximity to the city and itself is important , W@@ acker says that of a good company climate , as well as good mood between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated and looking back on the w@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we do the city of lively , &quot; &quot; he is thinking about the building office and its staff . &quot;
but also in the future there are varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the low @-@ board parking space are enclosed .
&quot; the cinema bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach becomes renewed , even the stadium is still subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter alone will beat some 1.5 million Euros to be@@ ech , &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker is estimated . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
for a city @-@ car@@ et@@ aker be large play@@ space .
with ha@@ zel &apos;s own building yard and gar@@ den@@ ner@@ ei can be quite flexi@@ bly re@@ acted .
&quot; you can move much , &quot; &quot; W@@ acker , and the design of the green plants will often be praised by citizens and visitors often . &quot;
&quot; since the old town is listed as ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; a eye for it &quot; if new@@ builds are approved , st@@ resses the separ@@ ating city construction . &quot;
the city council carries high responsibility .
&quot; he is builder , &quot; at the end everything runs all over my table . &quot;
&quot; for assistance and coordination , he can count on long @-@ term employees : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing this since ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also , that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wants : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wanted to be identified with the spot . &quot;
&quot; because continu@@ ity is not only important for a good company climate , but also for further development of the city . &quot;
&quot; according to the information of the town of Has@@ lach , a graduate engineer should present it as a di@@ pl@@ omas engineer or Bachelor with the field of architecture and have good specialized knowledge in the areas of construction and construction planning . &quot;
&quot; building and civil engineering , building management , barbecue facilities , management of urban furniture , urban property with building yard and municipal hus@@ band@@ ry as well as sub @-@ building administration , including monument protection . &quot;
bicycle on lines cast into : southern route closed
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown perpet@@ rators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) . &quot;
these were so badly damaged that the coming freight train had to be stopped .
investig@@ ators go out of two male servants and seek them for the night hours .
near the place of witnesses a ro@@ ot@@ ers Roll@@ ers and a bicycle driver has been observed .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ anno@@ y wit@@ s , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rators , or the perpet@@ rators would have brought himself into a great danger , and at risk of mig@@ rat@@ ory traffic . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the damage to the L@@ ok and the plant , as well as the late @-@ minute drive and the cost of rail transport can also be submitted to the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; in total , the spokes@@ man said of a &quot; significant &quot; sum , &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
&quot; the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the railway line could be guided without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning , almost ten people were fallen , two of them concerned the correspondence . &quot;
&quot; freight trains fell not , however , they were delayed . &quot;
&quot; according to the Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of the lines had to be exchanged . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help , IB@@ D ( inflammatory bo@@ wel diseases ) &quot;
red meats and chocolate can sound for your digestive system as a night@@ mare .
&quot; but a new study asser@@ ts exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , the symptoms of patients could relie@@ ve patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel diseases . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition , affecting around 1.3 million in the United States , affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States , causing stomach cr@@ amps and ble@@ aching , recur@@ ring or bloody attacks , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while the affected are usually advised to relie@@ ve meat and dairy products to relie@@ ve their symptoms , researchers found the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , stated that immune cells in the intest@@ ine pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro @-@ birds that hide themselves in the body do not penet@@ rate in the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are unable to dissolve inflammation , are balanced by cells , promote tolerance and protect the body without frag@@ ile tissues . &quot;
&quot; when the balance is too far towards inflammation , it may result in inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; in experim@@ enting , it was found that a type of tolerance convey@@ ing immun@@ cell in mice comes to a certain bacter@@ ium in its initi@@ ate . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Colonna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells which promote tolerance is produced . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han &apos;s nour@@ ishing food is toler@@ ant , less infl@@ amed gut mi@@ lie@@ us if the same system also work with people . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ doctoral printers in Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan was looking for a kind of immune cell , which took tolerance than they found out that a group of study powers such cells was , but another group of the same tribe that had not been separated . &quot;
&quot; it presum@@ ed that the difference was to do with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omes of the mice , the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , usually live in the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
the mice of the mice were found to be DNA sequ@@ enced and there were six species of bacteria that were present in mice with the immune cells but without them failed with the mice .
&quot; mice were drawn up in a ster@@ ile environment , so that they did not have a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and not developed this kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; to understand how the bacteria worked on the immune system , the researchers hes@@ it@@ ter@@ i had grown in an fluid and then led little quantities of liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells , which were isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant @-@ toler@@ ant cells .
&quot; as the active component of the fluid has been cleaned , it turned out to be known as a side product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ metabolism , known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by around 50 percent , but the number of cells were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan stated that humans have the same toler@@ ant cells like mice and that most of us reu@@ ter@@ i protect ourselves in our gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ side products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice but defects in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
she said : &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine .
&quot; potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ values can result in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic is committed to &quot; gen@@ ius &quot;
&quot; at Manchester United made a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes his debut on Wednesday evening against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot;
&quot; the first 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre@@ season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid will begin on Tuesday and impressed him as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira . &quot;
&quot; however , M@@ atic had been excluded from the pre @-@ Asia tour of the blues and made only 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had to improve that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later .
&quot; in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u started in the avi@@ va stadium as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had his start @-@ XI for the start of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted another three new comm@@ ences , but he insi@@ sted that the club has made a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to meet three of its four priority . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , thank you for the club , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four , but they have given a great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; painted &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the Boeing @-@ aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle in Washington State , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner across the USA , that are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
to the radar shiel@@ ds the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already done such advertising earlier .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
&quot; Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind turns out , as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , the prime minister &apos;s democr@@ ats came to Berlin with a certain concern for Berlin . &quot;
&quot; merely no stor@@ ks from the party centre , merely no head@@ wind from the bund - this is the most important wish of the election campaign . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz , the party has been fundament@@ ally changed . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from Willy @-@ Brandt &apos;s House are watching the events in the SPD &apos;s ruling capit@@ als . &quot;
&quot; what has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described in the approach with counter@@ winds . &quot;
there were deep impacts .
and one after another .
&quot; following the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CDU provides a generic signal against co@@ al@@ itions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green cannot be reliable , &quot; said CDU @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber the editorial network in Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising fra@@ ction@@ e@@ jec@@ tor of a Green M@@ EPs took over the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
&quot; five months before the Sunday election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from the CDU and F@@ DP . &quot;
&quot; the Green Party leader Michael Kell@@ ner , the ab@@ dic@@ tive Green Party of El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets , asked to return to their mandate . &quot;
the transfers to the CDU means a clear for@@ gery of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets must immediately return its mandate , &quot; said the federal leader and election campaign of the Gre@@ ens in Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true , however , in the morning , a SPD election sho@@ ckers , as on Friday morning the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ lander reached the party central . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is standing after the over@@ coming of green members of El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to the CDU without its own government majority . &quot;
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what &apos;s next .
the Mis@@ er began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more than not , calm down the comra@@ des . &quot;
&quot; after the parliamentary elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
&quot; that was , however , it was even worse and worse . &quot;
&quot; the SPD &apos;s defeat in Kiel brought the party into the dive , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite cleared the party smoothly . &quot;
&quot; so , comra@@ des , the comra@@ des and the weeks later , were up again . &quot;
&quot; then , when she had created new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and the next door came down .
&quot; Mayor O@@ laf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus at that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city burned . &quot;
&quot; and because he made everything wrong in crisis communication , then everything is wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Sch@@ olz fights for his political survival . &quot;
&quot; so now , Stephan Weil , too . &quot;
&quot; due to the VW @-@ exhaust and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Grand @-@ Sax@@ onian Prime Minister had already been in criticism of criticism . &quot;
mi@@ ese re@@ fra@@ c@@ ates were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or maybe therefore , because in the past few weeks , Weil tried to set acc@@ ents over the previous weeks . &quot;
&quot; comra@@ des of the former Mayor of Hannover , whose power in Berlin continued to expand his power in Berlin , was not hidden in the field of Martin Schulz . &quot;
&quot; they let him grant him , because they spoke of him a stabili@@ zation of the party . &quot;
&quot; now , the exact opposite could occur . &quot;
in this case there is no blame on the part@@ isan hospital at the part@@ isan hospital .
and Schulz does not even say .
&quot; at times , the comra@@ des also stri@@ ve to maintain its own ranks . &quot;
&quot; her anger is directed toward the Green Party , and above all in the par@@ ab@@ hor@@ ni@@ ge par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians in the life@@ jack@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and pre@@ dict@@ ory , like Mr@@ s T@@ jack@@ ets her own career training on the interests of all others &quot; , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of the party in the SPD Parliamentary Group , the editorial network in Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mr@@ s T@@ jack@@ ets is not elected as director of the European Parliament because of its person as a direct investment in the country , but the French @-@ Sax@@ on member states . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns its mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD Parliamentary Group , compl@@ ains an &quot; un@@ democr@@ atically man@@ oeu@@ vre . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the elec@@ torate was clear four years ago : the people have made Stephan Weil to the prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Austrian SPD as a leading candidate to the Bundestag , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now , the personal career of career thinking about a future CDU faction election , Op@@ per@@ mann said . &quot;
he asked to clari@@ fy the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there have been more or more ongoing commitment of the CDU Lower Saxony .
funding for Ort@@ sk@@ ern III
who wants to be sandy in the years can get support from the country soon .
&quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of Ste@@ g City development informed on Wednesday in Emp@@ fingen . &quot;
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler was once again a review of the events so far .
&quot; since 1991 , there has been in Emp@@ fingen San@@ cation areas . &quot;
&quot; at that time , in the San@@ cation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the San@@ cation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the surplus was still 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler the previous san@@ itation are a &quot; successful project &quot; - it &apos;s finally important to promote the interior development , not only new building areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , I have received the information from the governing council of Karlsruhe , which will give it a san@@ itation area III . &quot;
&quot; the funding amount to 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which would be 500 000 euros from the country , the rest from the municipality of Emp@@ fingen . &quot;
how is a san@@ ction area now ?
&quot; one will continue to investigate so Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; but there is also a role , whether in the planned area of all interest , to be rehabil@@ itated . &quot;
&quot; in this case , the local borders may also shift again . &quot;
&quot; the Ste@@ g arrived on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; cellar presented the contents of the federal states program &quot; Social City , &quot; where the san@@ itation would then be performed . &quot;
&quot; core of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , improving the residential and occupational conditions and preserve and expansion of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be objective , which means per property . &quot;
the restoration area would finally be defined as stat@@ ute .
&quot; the approval period has been running since January 1 , 2017 until 30 . April 20@@ 26 . &quot;
&quot; however , until September this year would only be carried out until September this year , as part of those involved in the rehabilitation area involved a questionnaire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , as possible , the pro@@ positions will be made possible with the renov@@ ations coming next year . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann declared that every Commun@@ e had to carry out the previous tests .
&quot; it is about to assess the urban@@ ization of the city and decide when san@@ itation becomes , and in what extent . &quot;
it will also be entered for the respective plot as well as a result in the basic book .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann , even after the Emp@@ fingen , will come again after the Emp@@ fingen and had a picture of the position , promised . &quot;
&quot; Got@@ zel emphas@@ ized , an essential success factor for the project would be the participation of those involved . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there will be questionna@@ ires who will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and be filled out until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; Building and Property System &quot; &quot; which is among other things around the con@@ struc@@ tional condition and the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; in grey questionna@@ ires , the &quot; household and housing &quot; , &quot; details can be made to size , distribution , and residents of a residential area . &quot;
the blue &quot; Operation Ar@@ c &quot; is only to fill if in the building of business rooms .
&quot; however , Got@@ zel pointed out that a filling questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not capable . &quot;
Sch@@ in@@ dler also emphas@@ ized that distribution of the funding according to the &quot; Wind@@ dog Prin@@ ciple &quot; function - who first comes first is ma@@ stered first .
you can reserve no funding for later . &quot;
&quot; for completion , photos of the project &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II &quot; were shown to make an restoration of &quot; pal@@ atable . &quot; &quot;
British inventor himself sets a micro@@ chip to come with a hand@@ ler in house and car
&quot; a British inventor is the first in the country with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his door , and can even start his car with a hand@@ ler movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and hands , and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has merged with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ aes@@ thes@@ ists in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , together to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is performed according to medical standard . &quot;
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; Mr North@@ am also wants to change the castles on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for a surcharge of £ 300 per castle . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now built both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the cost of the white house cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
&quot; the decision of the White House , to fly a marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that has resulted in American manufacturing in the last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers to the local military which has been left to the TIM@@ E magazine , up to 24.@@ 000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as the Navy One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th at the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , vice president Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour through products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a yacht out of Maine , a fire@@ man car from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft truck was issued in Connecticut . &quot;
&quot; the White House &apos;s military service demanded the presence of helicopter or fre@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , after records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted to be aware that you are aware of it because it &apos;s an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superior , vice @-@ deputy director for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17 at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock and so long , until the lawn was evacu@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening . &quot;
&quot; the note adds , that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of service hours a second team would be needed for the return flight . &quot;
&quot; the original crew of flight crew was during the event at the helicopter , while the security personnel remained on the ground by the plane . &quot;
&quot; out of the TIM@@ E made available , not clear , whether a second flight crew was necessary . &quot;
the Hatch Act prohib@@ its federal government to use governmental property for political purposes .
data sets show that H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 asked whether the event could viol@@ ate the determination .
&quot; one question we asked if it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked up , &quot; the deputy commander responded . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated as an official event by the White House and was not covered by the Hatch Act .
but official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave a violation of the reform of the health reform that was in the Senate , and prop@@ ag@@ ated the efforts to con@@ strain the government &apos;s legislation . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft that is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advant@@ ageous purposes . &quot;
pre@@ sidents are obliged to use it for the journey .
but your use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
&quot; Tr@@ ump was conducted in February an investigation as the presidential plane in front of the background of his first struggle r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , said the vice @-@ chairman of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 cre@@ ations often lead training flights in the Washington area around Washington and the South La@@ wn , to depos@@ e the U.S. president in the White House with precise centi@@ meter . &quot;
&quot; as Tr@@ ump in early July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 led 58 exercise programmes in the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; event attracted by the training needs of the flight information for the month , said an official . &quot;
Hel@@ icop@@ ter units flew 11 hours to this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support commis@@ sions . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers have no burden to the other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company had not been involved in placing the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 does not have bud@@ get@@ ing drawings for presidential flights and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
&quot; according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen of the U.S. Department of Defense for the 2017 financial year , the Do@@ D proceeds for the V@@ H @-@ 3D , however , is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour . &quot;
records of the unit recorded the flight time of the flight as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates put into consideration , is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in the annual means . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND trial conducted in 2015 , the exploration rates for Do@@ D does not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present these week things that are made in America , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said . &quot;
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot;
and I think of how most Americans are all proud of helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have un@@ ti@@ rel@@ essly worked .
&quot; of course , it is reasonable to raise . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear if Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter , when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ man . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and scher@@ eted with the media about his own fleet of corporate products . &quot;
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

&quot; in his departure , the law en@@ acted , &quot; I packed a few &quot; constitutional provisions &quot; , &quot; which he revealed . &quot;
&quot; the response from Moscow also was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels dropped against the US court . &quot;
&quot; after all , the design plans to pun@@ ish European companies which help Russians help to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU . &quot;

&quot; in the past kit@@ ten year , 2800 children were sitting at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , not only children who are served in the &quot; &quot; K@@ ita &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; K@@ ita &quot; &quot; will be explained . &quot;
the offer is also available in 35 @-@ hour supervision when children stay up to 14 pm .
&quot; 46 participants from the 1st of September , kitchen service : they heat the angel@@ able food , add it to let@@ tu@@ ce , raw vegetables and fruits , Por@@ tion@@ ing the meal individually , give the food , clean , rinse and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees will be assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two group@@ ed as well as sevent@@ e@@ jec@@ tors - decides on the tim@@ etable line .
&quot; the kitchen help now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; so they are much stronger , and it is easier for the kit@@ ties of easier , ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
because it is about : healthy food and cooking classes .
the children will help to prepare food .
the direct connection of the ch@@ amp &apos;s power to the team be makes sense .
even for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not continuously changing people . &quot;
this continu@@ ity is important to children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita rooms - so far the task of ch@@ icks @-@ out - is done in the future of special cleaning personnel .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also the charm of the kitchen &apos;s quality improvement , which it has been issued in the cost of ownership as the most economic costs , is called it from the press office . &quot;
and even though 46 part @-@ time employees are set ane@@ w .
&quot; but these hours fall at around 750 people in the educational area even so strongly in weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative , if all members of the society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Nicholas Hay@@ s@@ om , the re@@ ig@@ ning head of the United Nations &apos;s Mission , said that hundreds of women are involved in the elections in the provinces . three women can vote for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ rated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be really representative and cre@@ dible if women can participate un@@ restricted and involved in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
&quot; the Taliban have published threats against a choice process , which coinci@@ ded with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role . &quot;
&quot; this year , the elections for the first time the election will be peac@@ efully handed down by a democr@@ atically elected government . &quot;
Hay@@ s@@ om said a strong role for women will still strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afghan electoral commission reported that 1.2 million women have registered from a total of 3.6 million voters .

gain control of investments in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie factory in Glasgow
one union would like to engage in managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie on the long @-@ term commitment to production in their work in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company moved over the future of investment at the Toll@@ cross location .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the plant , next to other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea biscuits . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives became &quot; first experienced , &quot; if their activities would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter addressed to the company &apos;s manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s aim to express , &quot; concerns the financing of production lines not being driven forward . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB Senior organizer Dre@@ w Duffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can win no clarity over the needs and investment plans for the future of rab@@ cross , concerns our members . &quot;
generations of families have been working here and the labour force concentrate strong on the local community and the Groß@@ space Glasgow - an important pillar of human employment in an area with high unemployment and social benefit .
&quot; hence , under the perspective of jobs , the wage and prosperity , and before the background of the Bre@@ xit , the rising life maintenance costs and the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow urg@@ ently urg@@ ently needed a floral production line at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the Bank manager at Toll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland who will respond directly to the company , since we estimate the ongoing commitment of employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at Toll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed the employees that we operate as all companies that are working in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , to check our business and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to be competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; in the last years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our rab@@ bit location , especially in production lines and operating improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the inheritance of Toll@@ cross as a production facility and whole . should our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to learn this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years ago in front of Ne@@ y@@ mar ?
the site of La League may interest you interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Saint @-@ Germain won &apos;t leave Paris Saint @-@ Germain in her pursu@@ it of Ne@@ y@@ mar , to dis@@ able an offer of £ 189 million , but did they warned Barcelona three years ago in front of the world record ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 Club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous one , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the last season . &quot;
&quot; after the termination , Ne@@ y@@ mar is the most expensive player in the world and the most affordable professional athletes in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious over the way that Ne@@ y@@ mar has forced his way out outside , although a source in the vicinity of the Catal@@ ans pre@@ state insi@@ sts that the club has always given its best to take care of him since its arrival in Santos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned about three years ago by the PS@@ G pre@@ sidents in front of that view ?
&quot; when Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not concerned because they know if they touch one of our players , we will contact them in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign any of our players to sign up , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , whereby the Spanish association would express interest in the PS@@ G middle field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made clear that they would not allow it to travel from Italy under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing their price for Ne@@ y@@ mar . &quot;
sco@@ ot@@ ers thrown and damaged
&quot; in the night of Friday on Saturday , a well @-@ known perpet@@ r@@ ator has been deliberately thrown to a king &apos;s royal street in front of the property number 30 , and caused by the cl@@ adding of the vehicle &apos;s vehicle damage from more than 200 euros . &quot;

&quot; on Thursday night , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ ac@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um was on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; in the area of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car met him on his way to meet him , so that he had to depart to the right . &quot;

&quot; the driver of the opposite passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ hau@@ led a truck and continued his journey without taking the traffic accident . &quot;
it can be well done according to the accident damaged that the Mer@@ ced@@ es@@ driver did not even notice the accident .

&quot; interview : &quot; &quot; Dom@@ en@@ atzen Report by Pope , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
&quot; the reg@@ ens@@ berg Dom@@ en@@ atzen report to the abuse of failure , Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse of the State Dom@@ en@@ atzen continues to take care of discussions .
&quot; Christian Weis@@ sen@@ ator , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated according to the publication of the German press agency , he anticipated by the former Reg@@ ens@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the retired Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI . &quot;
it would serve the appearance of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deepest regret or their then false assessment of processes .
&quot; the Vatican Chancellor &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; however , critic@@ ised that in the coverage of violence in the Dom@@ en@@ atzen station with &quot; two measures &quot; was measured . &quot;
&quot; in respect of the gri@@ ps in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that it would be punished by &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful deeds &quot; , &quot; but the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian bio @-@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habits , the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es the public opinion on that for normal , writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in the interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; one likes to go to the church , and this is a broken gl@@ ands . &quot;
&quot; in addition , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; beats a completely normal education means &quot; were to be ready to become ready . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s standards on previous decades , because the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports about the mis@@ use cases , Pope John Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; totally in@@ justice , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who was translated with R@@ atz@@ inger the &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he considers the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report which was presented by the di@@ oc@@ ese of Regensburg with the En@@ lighten@@ ment Law@@ yer Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 shelves were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high pl@@ au@@ sibility &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; summar@@ ize , &quot; &quot; summar@@ ize , that by Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence . &quot;
at high E@@ mot@@ ion@@ ality the punishment for students could also fall severe .
&quot; in contrast to numerous other decision , many victims are estimated to estimate the general humanity of R. , and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories are connected to him . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use scandal of the &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ en@@ atzen George R@@ atz@@ inger of his opinion is dischar@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 pages report on the &quot; &quot; Incidents of Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ens@@ berg Dom@@ en@@ atzen &quot; &quot; gives a contra@@ dict@@ ory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for a lifting , many students put out his &quot; Human@@ ity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to the other , he also appears as a Chol@@ eri@@ ker and Perf@@ ect@@ ist , who became the econom@@ ist , when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz has no top performance . &quot;
how do you consider this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you do the effort and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you need to ask yourself , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appears in it . &quot;
&quot; to him , eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of every sus@@ pic@@ ion of medi@@ ator or fellow body in the terrible cases sexual abuse . &quot;
the non@@ sense of violence at the pre@@ school took place outside of its effici@@ encies .
&quot; it is possible to dis@@ card him , either late , or first suggest@@ ion could not be taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asium , on which he worked , was accepted by practically all respondents as literally - &quot; &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the broad majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also portra@@ ys a very excellent testimony , &quot; &quot; accurate , &quot; &quot; compet@@ ently , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; and &quot; understand@@ able &quot; , &quot; as an extremely expert teacher , who provided the boys regularly with cakes , cookies and bon@@ b@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; only a minority is compl@@ ained about his perf@@ ect@@ ism and its high E@@ mot@@ ion@@ ality , which led even to was@@ ps . &quot;
&quot; he did not only threw the chairs not only with chairs and throwing the keys to the ground , but also went ear@@ nest guys to the hair or ears , he himself regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for himself . &quot;
&quot; however , to his honour of honour , it must be said that such educational methods were common in fra@@ c@@ tional time , the 1960s and 1970s , widely used , with parents as at teachers . &quot;
do you still know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also have experienced this in a sec@@ ular school , a state gy@@ mn@@ asium . &quot;
&quot; compared to what &apos;s happening in this report , the advent@@ u@@ rous sexual abuse and violence at the pre@@ school , are the free excav@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; one asks , if it is not more likely to do with his acquain@@ t@@ ness and his role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media has just gone on him . &quot;
&quot; a lot of people who never understood him on the Bavarian Pope , still eag@@ erly awaited . &quot;
but the truth is : the report ent@@ ail Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
&quot; in the media , in connection with the report much about the subject of mis@@ use at the &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ en@@ atzen &quot; report . &quot;
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also be placed in the final report with regard to sexual abuse on sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted the Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consecr@@ ated .
&quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; said one affected representative for the others , &quot; It was all very embar@@ rass@@ ing . &quot;
the real problem of the En@@ lighten@@ ment of sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent .
&quot; if they did not commit to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then not a choir director , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ en@@ atzen station R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student form@@ ulated it like this : &quot; I see ... no case in which he would have had his findings and could have been able to stop the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; I hold it ... also for really absurd to assume that out of it ... Bu@@ ben en@@ etr@@ able or clear@@ er or rather opened , than compared to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ ants , confidenti@@ ality teachers etc . &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able .
&quot; so the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; that he was confi@@ ded in advance in advance and / or their environment , could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as regards sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is shared by every fellow worker . &quot;
&quot; so he cannot be accused of having taken him , or brought him to the ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to bring his good name to these contradi@@ cting crimes in connection , as unfortunately happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , much of &quot; violence in the &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ en@@ atzen &quot; was much to read . &quot;
he was accused of the former Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
does he have to live with this alleg@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem , that in the coverage everything was mixed and confused to a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence and anywhere , in the middle , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but that &apos;s exactly what is a mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; it is clean up separately : between the pre@@ school and the high school of the Dom@@ sp@@ ines , between sexual abuse and violence as well as , let &apos;s say , rest . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report inci@@ dents from the period since 1945 , thus also out of four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the choir director of the Dom@@ mo@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the entire aw@@ ful test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases , in which boy from sa@@ dist@@ al teachers have been confin@@ ed and toler@@ ated , all at the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen where really sk@@ in@@ ous states must have dominion . &quot;
&quot; but with them Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , for he got the boys only on her face when she had already been at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asium . &quot;
&quot; it was , like most of the most witnesses , the theme of &quot; Pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise of paradise . &quot;
what was different about the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asium ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : indeed , there was discipline , but no sa@@ dist@@ al violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims had estimated the general humanity of R. , and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; thus , at most , the accus@@ ation must be looked away . &quot;
&quot; however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which the conditions were reported on the pre@@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he started to establish itself and from the predecess@@ ors at a school that he did not work and was responsible ( such as the witness ) , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
&quot; before the conditions , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger completed the ears consistently ? &quot;
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asium who even re@@ produced the report . &quot;
&quot; in this , he points out to this point , &quot; that in the pre@@ school , the test will continue to pract@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; even in view of the risk of negative press , he recommended urgent income . &quot;
&quot; of course , that was , of course , at a time when legal clari@@ fications had long been banned in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; before that , they occurred in a legal grey zone , how each of us is still white . &quot;
it was also hard to estimate that those affected might be exagger@@ ated or dramatic and where really the permissible border was exceeded .
&quot; one can &apos;t say , but he would have ever looked away . &quot;
that is just not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the test of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria from Th@@ urn und Taxis claimed , it is un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s educational standards to the then time . &quot;
how do you see it ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann says : we speak histori@@ ans from the &quot; &quot; snare of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the danger of the past to today &apos;s moral measures . &quot;
the prin@@ cess has been right .
&quot; but this is of course not true for sexual abuse , which was ab@@ orted to all times and not for what was broken in the pre@@ school of resistance and violence against innocent children , this goes far beyond that time . &quot;
it &apos;s all aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it is finally done .
&quot; at the same time , I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger protection , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; its means to the discipl@@ ines and punishment , so they are celebrating ear@@ nest and in the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; as a physical punishment then it has been banned , he also has held strict confidenti@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; what is the picture of its kind of reg@@ gae , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was re @-@ given to you for the book &quot; My Brother of the Pope ? &quot; &quot;
was the subject of testing also included in the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells of his perspective , and the Dom@@ en@@ atzen played only one minor role . &quot;
nevertheless I didn &apos;t waste that he led a str@@ ingent regim@@ ent there .
&quot; but also this must be said once again : without these perf@@ ect@@ ism , without being un@@ question@@ able discipline , it would probably hardly been possible to form a global cultural ambassador in Europe and its musical tradition that went straight twice in the United States ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with cookies and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one does not make a big singer and a great singer and every success in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ crossing . &quot;
what kind of people do you have experienced by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger on the talks about their book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : thanks to his work on the book and in addition , I met George R@@ atz@@ inger really well and again as a wonderful , hum@@ orous , fundamental belie@@ ver , deep believing and heart @-@ good people , of whom you could not imagine that he could not do something of a fly . &quot;
&quot; I regularly receive a regular contact with how many former Dom@@ mo@@ atzen station today , 23 years after his Emer@@ gency Clinic , to visit him regularly - he is almost blind - and as a member of their family . &quot;
&quot; those who don &apos;t forgive him today , that he once been strictly to them , are clearly in the minority . &quot;
&quot; today , most Dom@@ sp@@ ines are grateful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music . &quot;
&quot; and that he always had a good , pat@@ ern@@ al teacher - a stri@@ cter father , certainly which may be - but nevertheless a lov@@ able respect to which they are still looking for . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again very clear : all that you ask for him are educational methods that were at the time of the agenda . &quot;
we can be glad we have overcome this time .
&quot; but it is highly un@@ fair , a man , only because he is promin@@ ently , and has an even more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sin@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intention that stands behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; the report , which was just released , was dischar@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; now , the annex@@ ation , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired large service and without the outside of Bavaria and probably no one would probably know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
