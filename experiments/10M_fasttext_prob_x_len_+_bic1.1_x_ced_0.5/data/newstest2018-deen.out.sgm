<seg id="3">"a pit chapel, which is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel."</seg>
<seg id="4">Smallgardeners are responsible for the unrusty reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Münch promotes exciting stories on days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's nervous when maps are not currently up.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everyone knows that ever had to be exciting because the car-Navi took place a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historic maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the geoportas Bavaria of the state government, are all other than currently - but just therefore very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compare it with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">"it is clearly evident, as towns and municipalities in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur has changed since the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the digital Bayern-Atlas is a Flickenteppi, which is not the same as such."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the big clearer map were designed for cities and municipalities in more detailed maps, so-called urine leaves."</seg>
<seg id="13">"these were originated according to the Bavarian surveying administration between 1810 and 1864, and the first surveying in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="14">Your Client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the spring of 1800, the French army leader became Bavaria since the Second World War of War with Austria."</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"finally, when French troops finally landed with the Peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801: there were today's neighbours who created the idea of an area-wide Bavaria map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max IV Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thereby the Bavarian Authority."</seg>
<seg id="19">The state-sheet of Munich is from the year 1856 and is like all others at the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the comparison of early / today is the case of the capital of capital, for example."</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is the sendling, which is still relatively isolated in the 1856 map."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was born 21 years after the map of the map, so 1877, as the Munich district."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, the ouling lies in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses were concentrated around 1856 along the Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmers against Austria, 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where the Westpark is today, you can see nothing as fields - at first glance: in the first sight, a small sequence card with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-written numbered pieces from the so-called" Urs "from which the basic tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots there are no farmers left there today - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of the sendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, since 1810 scene of the Oktoberfest, was in the 19th century it was still a meadow - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the ancient position, one reads in the area of the present district Au-Haidhausen, not only the street names" at the Gasteig "or from the" "hill" "- but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt. ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here on the Auerfield road, one once locked people with madness."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in 1858 / 59, the Munich district-Irrenanstalt" was founded "On the Auer Lüders." "</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden managed the establishment of a psychiatrist, which was brought to King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chains of the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he has prohibited the staff to apply violence against the occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the museum Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the Anstika. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients first had been space, later it was expanded to 500 seats."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was not enough - the reason for the construction of the county seat in hair in 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006 Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrist."</seg>
<seg id="40">"on the area of former Auer Anstalt, youths now meet young people in the Munich Salesanum."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the Order acquired the building complex in 1920, and went into a youth house with training."</seg>
<seg id="42">"West is located in the football field of TSV Munich east, east residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" Casa Don Bosco "was established in an architectural rejection to the origin of the Irish Institute, destroyed during the Second World War."</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was in 1856 as "main square" the department of the department was called "Kaufinger alley."</seg>
<seg id="45">"a decisive change brought to the Second World War in the heart of Munich, too."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in December 1944, the Allied bombs broke many holes in the city centre."</seg>
<seg id="47">A big stayed until today - on Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English institute, small business houses and a Gruftkapelle from the Middle Ages, once stood on Marienhof where this day had to work and take place on April 5, 2017, for the second S train line."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the shooting singer, the old Munich card can compare with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole in the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group publishes travelogation for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">"the National Association for conveying Farming has issued a warning for colored people, which will travel due to discriminating politics and the racist attacks of the state after Missouri."</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Board for the state of Missouri, which will come into force on August 28, 2017, calls for afro-American travelers, visitors and missourians, as a number of fragmentation, racial-based penalties in the entire state and indicated here, is in the opinion of the group."</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes people harder to gain discrimination, as well as the enforcement agencies of the state that aim to release the legal proceedings, the NAACP said."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have injuries of the civil rights, people will pass."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they will be stopped due to their skin color, they will be routed or killed," said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group quoted incidents such as rassisting losers against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"in the beginning of the year, Sanders died under questionable conditions at the beginning of the year, after being taken out of the country by the State of Missouri and accused of being accused of having accused of crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also refers to a recently published report by the Office of the Generalate-Office of Missouri, in which black motorists will be more common in the state 75 percent more frequently than white."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and employees inform about what could happen in the Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">People must be willing to bring whether it should bring to the money or relative to the state that they go through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"in 2015, in 2015, the FBI reported a total of 100 hate-break, according to the latest figures from the Hasselbreaking-report programme of the FBI which notices the state in terms of number of such injuries on the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to accuse a company for living or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had passed travel charges for Texas and Arizona, after the United States adopt enforcement agencies to suspend people for immigration abuses, which will contribute to the public profiling of the ACLU."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel charges are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in recent times, stakeholders have used the measure as reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">The fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fishing fence-fence project is a success project and will continue in the next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU / German Parliament Peter White and Kordula Kovac received a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"during the burial of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fisheracher CDU was met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann granted the first insight into its operation in which he served 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young birds and houses in five apartments."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" Black Forest "is for him the alternative market way for milk of his cows, so swendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">"on the table of the cottages, exclusively regional is available."</seg>
<seg id="74">"since he is a BLHV-Chairman of Fisbach's Fisherbach, he called the" elementary project "important."</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not generate profit margin on such a steep level.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green area for a lot of work, much to be handled with the brushcutter."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here to fight with the conditions and with the topography," Schwendemann emphasized. "</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the operation and used this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if it does not lead bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" the Commune has recognized the importance of the fence project and is glad about the leaders of the Leader. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at a cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">"it is hope that it could be moved out for a while, even for a while."</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure we have, are people who work in agriculture and make thoughts on how they continue their operation," the mayor was stressed. "</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often standing in the critique</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">"the open area is thus 40 hectares, which can not be checked up to at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"half of the total costs in the amount of 71 500 Euro, half of the leaders of the village was funded by the municipality of Fisbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmer continued to invest 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 km of the fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of fences," said Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you do not make a real job without farmers and fellow women.</seg>
<seg id="90">"Peter White, too, stand firm:" here are best food produced here. "</seg>
<seg id="91">The state-of state-of-Württemberg (lpr) Baden-Württemberg allows the state support of wheat fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The objective of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Requirement is the presence of one of the lpr.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the covering area should not be more bad (hangar over 35 percent) and must be threatened by the reaporation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"the request of eight participants with 24 plots in 2018, the request of eight participants, running just under 16 kilometers of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the open area is equivalent to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as much as any other - hence the sort of sort by Saddam Hussein's company in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump-regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heat dispute with Jim Acosta by CNN via the proposals of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boaters and Liberty-Imitt would have fought him when he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he laid hold on its importance, and in particular the importance that it was attributed to the famous poem by Emma Lazarus, 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base has been added."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta:" I don't want to go to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty... a symbol of American freedom which lightens the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">"the poem, which you refer, later added later and not part of the original statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller lies properly, but as he's formulated it, it's not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary response to the awaking words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state not only charges any old immigrant, but the trouble of the poor:" your mills, your arms, to breathe freely, and the poor waste of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "elaring waste" was better to see better on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he clearly stated that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict in the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">"Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after her death on the basis - did not know that she had a highly political action."</seg>
<seg id="113">"the sculpture was to show the connections between French and American republics, showing them in a worn classic picture showing the female embodiment of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this importance: in her poem the female character is no longer abstract - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And they themselves have a different name: mother of the exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The association's connection with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just like Lazarus, the meaning of the statue changed, people wanted to change the right wing of the right wing."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the big cry of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John of the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty arrived, but rather an early neoconservatives, that the American flame is in the surrounding world:" Lady Liberty continues. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch shall not lighten the way into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="121">"rather unusual, Limbaugh is quite unusual here."</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and even a matter of perception of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus existed in it so much as they were seen by the exhaustive, but hopeful people after long and often horrific travels on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"it is in the true sense, therefore, to see the world from the perspective of human beings, seek refuge and improve a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">"their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome, which they must hear."</seg>
<seg id="126">"and this is, of course, not to recognise the perspective of Miller and Trump."</seg>
<seg id="127">"her torch shall not lighten the way, but hatred that is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle remembers a time when only two shallots belonged to the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id="130">"the power director of athletics in the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the world championship ader has won a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "in Scotland something special" and athletics in the United Kingdom has to learn something from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue to continue until we'll find out," "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and you think it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the road corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals-candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butalt- which will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m circuit while Eiliie Doyle was elected to the team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"her chapter talk was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a series of athletes, whether they were Scottish, or wherever they live or train, went out of space and felt very motivating."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and genuine feeling that Eiliie, of course, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth Silver medal winner, which will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says that it is" unbelievably "that 16 shallots in the British team are."</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's best overall number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which had been reached in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">"in the last year, Muir carries out five British and two European records last year."</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part of the 1,500 m and 5,000 m rounds."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another flock that you are looking for a great season, which was the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships as the only second Scotsman in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team-capitals states that she is" enormously proud of the fact that many of their countrymen did not only belong to the team, but in some cases the medals and the finals are joined. "</seg>
<seg id="151">"so special about the team capitol to be in it, that it was voted by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but to know that my team mates voted for me and voted me to something completely especially for me," "she added."</seg>
<seg id="152">Obviously I am very proud of all the villi who belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to rise to poets."</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my speech given as chapters?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think it went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home World Championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to use this home support and benefit that we are back on the Olympic Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go and compete there, and it will be just like a great atmosphere there."</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking of critics on Facebook: do not work for a public office if you do not carry the heating of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers hit him because of all, from the internal politics to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">He appealed to the critique of criticism.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he didn't put his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783, Washington said:" freedom of speech can be taken away - and, silly and dumb, we become like sheep to battles. "</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work with it more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on its official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union complained him therefore at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the staff of the governor dismissed the lawsuit as frivol, and the online comment was full of a counter-action with" Na, and?. ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is just Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if there is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">"this is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heitzhead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a strong hand at the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillfully sent to use Facebook as primary means to join with his voters and make his haired head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, blocking of persons appearing on the side of the Governor - which is a public forum, which is officially designated as officially and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessarily, and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokesperson Amelia Chasse gave the actions of the governor and argued that the comments of comments is nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too simple to use the image of controlled or spill people, that sweep the whip online."</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders, a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said, that their comments are respectful, thoughtful and not benefited."</seg>
<seg id="184">The Bible quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyer Lakshmi Sarani of Bowie, Md., was not hassin, but she asked about hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented on politely that I was disappointed, that there was no response to hate speech and other current news," she wrote in the commentary area of the message "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea even if a number of people on the same theme takes place, then they will be used by some more than a so-called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"the employees of the governor as" concentrated spam-attack, "would probably call other" intercession "." "</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in the past time when you have done the same, that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical guide books and to burn or burn protesters and to silence."</seg>
<seg id="191">But just that happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">"Hogan is not the first public official, who criticises Facebook and other social media."</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is complained by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question occurred last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to the U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they appointed a voters from their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) received a visit from ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time Washington, the time of the affordable portos had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers behaved between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous correspondence hit his guidance."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people that pseudonyms such as" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius, "and" Portius, "wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions that criticised his position on the contract of Amity, the trade and shipping with Britain, will overcome his office, according to the historical documents which were collected by the online Papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he didn't put them into silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, opinion of opinion and discourses are the foundation of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true guidance means to accept this.</seg>

<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with passion for real estate, shrinking in 2014 from a big house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court Apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I searched for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I showed this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I love myself in love and made an offer on this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a single room property with a fine layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, much light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"to this end, she commissioned the architects and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi in Notting Hill that was a 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home, not just a development, but also a place to life for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine with a mezzanine where you could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to consider creatively to resolve the submission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel movement is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so arranged that they were stacked together, without that we had to gaps ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it wasn't just about building a simple platform, but to lay the steel so that it had the right height for the top or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">"this arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height, with much additional drama."</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper light window of retrouvius comes down via the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of skewers plays a role when adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen you feel like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units for all top-corner and glasses of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room is able to close the kitchen when it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">So special about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went in," explains Erfan of stainless steel reinforced, veneered MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is important, so it is when you push the door high, very easily glides."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the cleverable use of space and storage space, Joanne additional 16 m ² could win, an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the footprint - or as your property is appreciated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in an rudimentary form, a real estate agents will occur and a calculation is based on soil size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here they managed to enlarge the ground surface, and simultaneously to use high-quality materials that make room its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and that therefore help to create an emotional ties in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you do not love yourself in the electrical outlets in the walls."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they do not play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment itself can be transformed by good design and increased square meters of slightly standardly into something completely predictable.</seg>

<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, in his first working day with senior employees, he introduced a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he would repair: bad information that into the hands of the president."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information should flow via him - whether on paper or in postings - because the president would make better choices if he would have good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring its media monitoring."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps's relationship to television is enough for decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when candidate Trump was annoyed because of unfair coverage, it was productive to show it that he received a fair coverage of jobs that were to convince him," said the former election campaign of Sam Nunberg in February to POLITICO. "</seg>

<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know what we do not know - that Trumps Tweet could not contain more ignition material without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump is not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his collaborators were able to keep him away some times, annoyance of him, their efforts have been worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody has consistently been able to prevent Trump Controversen.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"a part of the problem exists that people in a White House, which consists of competing parties, will always try to present their own agenda by making trump material that possibly promotes their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"in May, POLITICO - informed about this story - reported information about the preference for strategic reasons about the preference for strategic reasons."</seg>

<seg id="1410">"exactly this happened at the end of February, when somebody accused the printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy Chief of Katie Walsh," the source behind a heap of leaks "at the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson had been banned from Twitter because he has offered no specific evidence, or that he was in the past false allegations and calls them in the past."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to ask employees about Walsh.</seg>

<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his adviser are still striving for influence."</seg>

<seg id="1486">"in the focus of the investigations, several men are to stand as a consultant of the Republicans."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller also took more and more Trumps private and business environment among the microscope."</seg>

<seg id="1535">"the melt of scraps and Eisberg increases the sea level, as they swim on the water and pushes the ice as much water as it emerges after the melt."</seg>

<seg id="1814">"safety experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: opponent, neutral, ally."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"you ask the reporter, names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal feelings."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drugs smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the secret list of the government or the cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no rest from the violence, and throughout the country the corpses are frequent, there are more journalists. at least 25, since the President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 have been standing for attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter is their editor and her inspirator of Rioce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake it is to be living in Mexico and to be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his lack is felt deeply, although its presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word" Justice, "t-shirts, wearing T-shirts, who show his smiling face with glasses or typical Panamanian."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporter discuss their shared themes, trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"even though, in 2010, a Sonata Confederation was erected to edit the cases of journalists, according to the Committee to protect journalists only two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murders, who are connected every year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderer of journalists are rarely provided."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce, they are still able to handle the violence of Sinaloa while they are inseparable, even though the terrain is still avengaging."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information on the murderer, without justice, the meeting on the discussion of security is little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know what we know, we know all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he only managed to drive a few blocks away, before his red Toyota Corolla was arrested by two men. he was shot out of his car and was shot at him for 12 times, probably due to the name of the newspaper, who translated with" twelve river. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter ran away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans arrest last year and delivery in the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the country's bloody battlefields, as rival factions here fight to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the road, or that the cemetery is full of embellished, two-story mausoleeen for drug-builders, which are bigger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget it for a minute that there is a state of" rest, "if only a Kartell has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading routes to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Rioce, was blended with guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February the publication of a interview with Damo Lopez, a leader of the rivaling cartel fractions in the war with Guzmans sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication might have depandalized the sons, followed by Ganges, bought every copy of the output, as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was to force Valdez, not to force, according to the decision of another newspaper, which had published the same story, to leave the country to its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">"he had survived so long for his friends and colleagues, that he would always be there."</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he worked as an experienced journalist for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined together with five colleagues to the founding of Riodoce and sold over 50 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa, it was impossible to run journalism without encounter any of the dutch problem," Bojorquez said. "</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with the time, the newspaper earned a call for the courageous and honest coverage, and the sales and advertising participated."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved it to be published without fear of censorship, and the readers were intrigued by a publication that they could read stories that nobody else dared to deal with."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot Award "for their reporting in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage at the prosecution of the Mexican drug history, wherever she also led them."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up to that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue," "he said at the time of the CPJ Award."</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV in October."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You need to take over the task to get to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked," "What have you done so many of the dead... why did you not say what went before?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team lost Valdez, the fun bird that could curse the fun, who was generously with hugs and suggestions, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted on his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He always would carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always sit to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit on the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now they ask: was his love for routine, his calamity?"</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also forced them to ask her own assumptions in question, how to do their work in the best and staying alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it if you are dealing with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their home starting and landing ways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," "Bojorquez said."</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censored and self-keeping."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instiners.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"when it doesn't smell, stay away."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said," smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing with Javier happens. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, apply in Sinaloa no more - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, in which a toxic mix of lucrative smugums, weak institutions and corrupt government officials."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>

<seg id="1871">Two policemen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">"they were commissioned by the state government, to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-class building in Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in sheath, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who described the governor themselves as not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months ago, since the reporter passed into the mountain landscape, where the drug regimens are not under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the output of this week, Riodoce has on three main layers."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">"they also had an exposé to the government spending, concentrated on the home town of the Governor."</seg>
<seg id="1878">"there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office building, a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was abducted or as it happened, so caution was done when everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favourite source of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a Politiker, who ruled the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled almost the entire century all political levels."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of upheaval cases of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"in this restaurant, in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman asked for a military incident in this restaurant, in which a son of" El Chapo "was a military incident."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"just a few months earlier, readers had seen the column of Valdez as the best informed source about the abduction."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we had known what happened," "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" El FLACO "because of its slender body."</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"Valdez's office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers, who are protesting against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something that they never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration due to another journalist to the Office of the State.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burnt body was discovered and officials, based on DNA tests that it is his."</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists all over the country have become stronger than journalists in the organised protests "SOS Press" in obedience and construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day, the director Bojorquez is gone to Washington and tried to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"in a meeting with the Governor of Zinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy journalists and to kill them because they have said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has since then asked that it is divided by the government, because she is concerned that their anger has violated their objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly told that journalists in Mexico organized by organizing crimes committed to the government officials and an equal company.</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book," Narco-journalism "he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug abuse, but also on orders of politicians and security forces who put together with organised crime under a ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"last year, the Media Waters group" Articulo 19 "has more than half of the attacks on police officers and officials."</seg>

<seg id="1905">Some journalists fled from their home states or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still observe the streets and are looking for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are chased, as evidenced to the photographer of Reuben Espinosa, who was assassinated three months along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>

<seg id="1926">"the report in the journal" Current Biology "described him as" the preserved dinosaurs dinosaurs ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs specimens of the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">"the fossil is a newly discovered kind of Nodosaurier, who lived in the middle of the chalk time between 110 million and 112 million years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his incredibly well-persistent condition, researchers, who describe it as" really remarkable ","</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports, in National Geographic, the mored plant-glaciers is the best preserved Fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, when he took place on March 21, 2011 at Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he hit something that appeared from the surrounding rock at the Platze, and decided to look closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">It was discovered by him Fossil sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blinking a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it was asleep," "said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creation has to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="1936">It will go to the scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa the dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers found out that this plant-gluttons, although it is covered with a armour and resembles a convertible tanks, probably threatened by flesh-carnirs dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strong dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide themselves before carnies, and used a parachable technology that is known as counterattacking, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this could have been allowed to mix much better in its surroundings and to avoid his enemies, experts say that it was threatened by greater dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines in May and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal, and it was called Borealopelta markelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that had spent more than 7.000 hours in order to expose it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"amazing conservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and form of shed and armaments about his body."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the shady, a widespread defense method in the animal, meaning that the top of the creature darker was as their underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the Conveyor is common, the results are surprising because the size of Borealopelta by far the animals live today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it suggests that the dinosaurs was hunted by sufficient pressures through meat-res dinosaurs, that evolution of the confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use the shady, think about Rehe, Zebras or Armaids - are much smaller and injurious as a prey, which signals that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real battle for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behaviour on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predator of the Cretaceous must have been" "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs rored was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate the animal on critics, including his preserved Darminhaltes to figure out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, caught up into a river and went out into the sea, where he fell on the back to the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was so warm like South-fluorida today, and rivers and oceans now spread much further inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with confrontal skin but also in three dimensions, and the original form of the animal retains," "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal today looks almost exactly as in the early chalk period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use much fantasy, to reconstruct it. if you're just a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that he is asleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk time was a time when huge thermal periods, carnivorous dinosaurs, stood on two legs, covered the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, million years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaurs was hunted from some of his terrible ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tonnes heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, their latest insights in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta after death sank into the sea and swapped up in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he took place on March 21, 2011 at Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the dinosaurs dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armour, and is completely from the muzzle to the hips."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"it contained two 20-inch long tips, which razed from his shoulders."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the armored plant-glaciers was shocked through the western Canada, until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the dinosaurs of the dinosaurs keep his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">"the limestone remains of this particular specimen is so well preserved, that the hood still cover hollow tank plates along the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, is such a level of preserving so 'rare like a win in lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I see it, the confusing it will."</seg>

<seg id="1977">"the action was light up to moderate injuries, said a police raid."</seg>
<seg id="1978">A great essay to rescue vehicles was at the accident point.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">"in the district of Munich, approximately ten kilometres of long recovery was formed."</seg>
<seg id="1981">Like an AZ reporter reports it on the counter-way to massive disabilities - through numerous Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1982">"the firefighters notched the label of the vehicle manufacturers, which now have to calculate with sensitive issues."</seg>
<seg id="1983">"shortly after 18: 45 the second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing."</seg>

<seg id="1993">"at present, the Deutsche Bahn testet is the most creative vehicle control."</seg>
<seg id="1994">"it is simple, simply by mobile phone, taken the ticket to take away the ticket."</seg>
<seg id="1995">Currently a test run on two routes.</seg>
<seg id="1996">"comes the offer, wide we recommend it."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"it is expected to be available in Germany at the beginning of the year, on many other remote transport routes in Germany," said a railway speaker. "</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort Check-in" is called by train the ticket recovery without Schaffner.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"to use the use, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to have an online ticket - what's going to do most passengers already.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"it also has to have purchased the app by rail, DB Navigator, which is the most convenient type of the ticket booking anyway."</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last one needs a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"because the" comfort check-in "works so: you get into the train, calling its ticket by" "My tickets". ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">"with the test customers, a button on the electronic devaluation appears."</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train managers get a message that driving gast X is located in the train and taken the booked seat field Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">"the train manager is responsible for the ticket inspection at room Y, he knows that there is a passenger with already devisable online ticket."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"so you can continue to sleep, continue, keep silent."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for rail, which is to take advantage of the passengers. "</seg>
<seg id="2009">"who wants to travel without ticket monitoring through our train accompanying personnel, check in the DB navigator itself."</seg>
<seg id="2010">"this allows the passengers to design their travel time in the train of personal," says Michael Peterson, Marketing-Management of DB Ferntraffic. "</seg>
<seg id="2011">Second Plus: "and our employees have more time than today to enter the individual customer needs.</seg>
<seg id="2012">"if you are often running, know that beside the delay and missed ways, the ticket inspections are among the greatest offences."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"for often, in any case, however, one of the travellers do not need all documents related to the devaluation of online tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either is missing the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document that you must show.</seg>
<seg id="2015">"the result are endless discussions between train leaders and driving force, which leads to worse mood in the part or large area and delays in control of your own tickets and the Schaffner takes the time to take care of other concerns."</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">"and that's just on the links ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912, Stuttgart-Essen."</seg>

<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, assured a different policeman and cried:" I will kill you... animals all. ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," "Ferrell reminded their statement."</seg>
<seg id="2035">"this is not the kind of murder, to which we have used to us and that we can name typical."</seg>
<seg id="2036">"at this moment, I felt chills."</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">"she booked a return flight, and went home the next day."</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after the landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson in the next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets? "" in cinemas as of September 11. "</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the sight of human beings, living in the community and have filled the streets to challenge answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as a ferrell with her daughter, which carried a flower dress and a suitable crown, after Ferguson, the two are a conversation, which they had countless times before this morning" over the black experience and the black condition. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I have taught you, when black people have to fight for what they believe?" remember what she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we go to Ferguson, because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not bring them away," "said Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What happened today is a highlight of it... what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">"it must know, and see it, and it will be tucked up."</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to free to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have lucky enough to give you an experience, in which she personally experienced no eklatent racism, it is no different than the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would have a bad service to keep them away from it."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police station that was at a camp site when the activists on the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson waited."</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and helped to pass on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">"slowly, a new type of activism began to take shape."</seg>
<seg id="2055">"after August 9, my activism has changed," "she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority student Nurse Association, and focused on food and health inequalities in black congregations."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has come all. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, a co-director of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farr wanted only" document "what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came to Ferrell in the meaning: "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this scepticism was nourished by countless instances of people, often by white - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as folayan recently stated in an interview," "We had heard that people who were born in Ferguson and raised their voices, and we wanted to make it different."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is well known for its activism around Todestract."</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought Ferrell's project closer together with six other natives followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns pathway.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking to us. we speak," "Davis said."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are presented, because I will be presented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to focus on Ferrells's experience - to show that it is not a messiah leader, but for a community that comes together," said Folayan - it turned out to be the most obvious participants in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells life, as she loves to love and marry her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "said Ferrell and laughed, when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"but I understood that there must be certain injuries at this work, and in the violation of black people."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells history is repeating the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, who identified the film" BlacklivesMatter "in social media in 2012, identify themselves as a gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are fighting to different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to notice that" the movement truly is maintained by black women and many black women. "</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is no affirmative type of action, "in which Ferrell has chosen as a heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who came up for this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no coincidence, although it was at the front, because with a life on these cruises as a black, gay woman is so much in the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, news cameras in Ferguson have disappeared, but the rattitudes between the church and the police continue."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a motorway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the social atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless she clung to a song and she feels committed to this memory, since they entered into Ferguson three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love one another.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "magnitude": TV readers discuss about Bit Gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the Bit Gallery moves the people, although it is not yet built long."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping center on the outskirts of the pedestrian zone has been unfolded since the first presentation of 2009 the population in supporters and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold the subject could hardly be one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The theme is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while those who say to the Bit Gallery:" that would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" That's real "" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "" don't need a man "" (Siggi Baking) or simply: "" magnitude! "" (Lars Scholz). "</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the supporters build that a gallery contains more customers in the city, of which the other businesses benefit, the enemies fear that the pedestrian zone denounced."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"on the premises: the gallery is planned, on which the peasant market stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with the beginning of the construction, it will end."</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery Macher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - as a place for Beda-Platz with the possibility of sitting outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone rooms: "we've been buying a weekly market in the peasant market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the farm women are always happy again."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We have also discovered the butcher for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to wish that during and above all after the construction of the gallery a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"in other cities, there is also."</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "if direct marker in a market hall in the gallery arrives at the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">But that should not be low for the new project. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what is the most shopping mall in bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"clothes, shoes, drones or supermarkets: I find the superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shop stores are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but here, however, there is not once a regular weekly market, it is the more important that at least the Market Hall remains at least."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there is fresh, mostly offered by the producer, and is completely priced."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, shop transactions are rented in a shopping center only by larger companies, because the breads are often not portable for one retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, special stores, there are almost no more and what is left, will vanish even though."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit me together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where is the peasant market during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even on the duration if the Bit Gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it create the ghosts Bit Gallery previously to drive all shops from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that will not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center that is empty, no one needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a peasant hall it's thanks to the insane many - as I find - sensual building projects in bitburg is no more space.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the peasant hall kapok, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York many faces can be seen - white, black and brown that are almost unnoticeable - which hang on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and hairstyles that were sent from Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent a 35-year-old sentence from prison in Fort Leavenworth, where she made a 35-year-old sentence after she publicly made diplomatic news on the WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August is A Becoming Resemblance (An appropriate similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">"it is the product of two years correspondent between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was established in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwife and breaking dissidy, whose conviction of Barack Obama was only three days later."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis and created out of the 30 portraits, like someone with these genomic data could not only look for the formability of DNA data - the many wise men, such as they can be interpreted and the toughness determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, has been openly pronounced on the identification as wife, has been sentenced to 20 years in 2013, including six violations of the spying law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"by the prison her picture was suppressed, so very that there was only one photo - a grain, black-white selfie, in which maning is deliberately situated on a driver's seat, which has been associated with them."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came just from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist portrayed portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like a cigar enstummel and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of that people might look like."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg with a press preview of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not visit at that time and could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea, and asked her if she wanted a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and their incarcerated Muse were sent to unequal letters, who replaced several letters in the course of two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"even they were created by Shoili Kanungo Illustrierte Comic" Suppressed images, "which would foresee a future and would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"Obama actually had just a few days after the book was published, Manning release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy meetings."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also a little depth and Starkes, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweaking ways to fix the rigid divisions that he actually should fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"as Dewey-Hagborg, after a strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen out of a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in one of the Gallery of the Gallery, Manning called for her superior signature (the" i "in their family names) an end of the" automatic fragmentation which have been the basis of gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence is a thoughtful of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide according to the highly developed scientific Lexicon of the artist), as surprisingly similar, at least in biological ways we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people hopefully bring to them, is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how openly genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories, too. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell you so many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic Novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">"it shows Manning, how it appears with a hands of hands in the hand of the United States, like King Kong."</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they chill your word, then they have won," says it. "</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so never leave the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," "said the artist, who greetings from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get geared, if I speak about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was supposed to be seen in the comic book - but if they should do it then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by their own genomic simulators who gather together like hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2155">"that was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Manning stature), where their genetic haul was written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past, I had her on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a crowd of lives," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed itself with Chelsea, like the movement, which were also behind their liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection which was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpectedly emotional."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I have only responded to the thumb pressure on the page of a letter that was written by a double victory in the 1700-s, who worked for the Jacobins."</seg>

<seg id="2306">"the intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown because the National Trust received the full access in 2006, when the final Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died."</seg>

<seg id="2390">"yes, indeed."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founders of FRR, we must start taking their ascent seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eyelids of the robot, its form of nipple and the type of fingernail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people are funny about it, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will see them much more frequently to see," said Mr Sharkey on the release of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">"modern Sexpuppen have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin, which feels warm - with conscious human reactions, which can be achieved through artificial intelligence."</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can customize its robots, according to his beliefs, and choose everything from the eye color of the robot through the form of nipples to the type or color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but there is still worrative, as many robots possess" personalities "that would have a Stepford-wife progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have developed to robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot allows an example to customize its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they are attractive, such as tiapness."</seg>

<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" is it on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a table or just another sex toys."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their origination and their increasing refinement indicate a bit darker and deep refinement in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire to sex with subjection as an optional encore."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men, of course, do not keep sex robots, and while the FRR notices its rising popularity, they are still temporary on the verge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what leakened out of the Random zones can be in terms of the spirit of the time, in which we are living, very educational."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"and many people are not strange, or insulting, until they charge the free market for this."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain overlapping that these highly developed sex robots are threatened with a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House to have attacked women sexually attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most terrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the handmaid ') are not the graphical images, the swallowed of unaffected bodies, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>

<seg id="2419">"but, when it comes to the point, the robots are not a real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They can't separate or simply move away from their companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no placement or background history, nothing that could disturb on independence or something, which could disturb the fantasy of total subjection."</seg>

<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help, IBD (inflammatory bowel diseases)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meats and chocolate can sound for your digestive system as a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study asserts exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, the symptoms of patients could relieve patients with inflammatory bowel diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition, affecting around 1.3 million in the United States, affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States, causing stomach cramps and bleaching, recurring or bloody attacks, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while the affected are usually advised to relieve meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers found the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the intestine patrol to ensure that harmful micro-birds that hide themselves in the body do not penetrate in the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are unable to dissolve inflammation, are balanced by cells, promote tolerance and protect the body without fragile tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"when the balance is too far towards inflammation, it may result in inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">"in experimenting, it was found that a type of tolerance conveying immuncell in mice comes to a certain bacterium in its initiate."</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells which promote tolerance is produced."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had of these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of Tryptophan's nourishing food is tolerant, less inflamed gut milieus if the same system also work with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the post-doctoral printers in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was looking for a kind of immune cell, which took tolerance than they found out that a group of study powers such cells was, but another group of the same tribe that had not been separated."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it presumed that the difference was to do with the intestinal microbiomes of the mice, the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, usually live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of the mice were found to be DNA sequenced and there were six species of bacteria that were present in mice with the immune cells but without them failed with the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were drawn up in a sterile environment, so that they did not have a intestinal microbiome and not developed this kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria worked on the immune system, the researchers hesitteri had grown in an fluid and then led little quantities of liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant-tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"as the active component of the fluid has been cleaned, it turned out to be known as a side product of the tryptophan-metabolism, known as Indol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by around 50 percent, but the number of cells were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that humans have the same tolerant cells like mice and that most of us reuteri protect ourselves in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-side products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice but defects in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said: "the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2603">"potentially, high tryptophanvalues can result in the presence of L. reuteri to an extension of this population."</seg>

<seg id="2746">The White House argued that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the cost of taxpayers on the basis of estimates put into consideration, is highly misleading," said Walters. "</seg>

<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 shelves were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" with high plausibility "victims of overprint, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it says to Georg Ratzinger who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg:" summarize, "" summarize, that by Domenellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">At high Emotionality the punishment for students could also fall severe.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"in contrast to numerous other decision, many victims are estimated to estimate the general humanity of R., and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories are connected to him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal of the" "Regensburger Domenatzen George Ratzinger of his opinion is discharged."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440 pages report on the" "Incidents of Violence" "at the" "Regensberg Domenatzen" "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for a lifting, many students put out his" Humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"to the other, he also appears as a Choleriker and Perfectist, who became the economist, when a Domspatz has no top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you consider this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you do the effort and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you need to ask yourself, why the name Georg Ratzinger appears in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"to him, eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of every suspicion of mediator or fellow body in the terrible cases sexual abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2915">The nonsense of violence at the preschool took place outside of its efficiencies.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"it is possible to discard him, either late, or first suggestion could not be taken seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was accepted by practically all respondents as literally -" "redemption," "heaven" and "better world". ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also portrays a very excellent testimony," "accurate," "competently," "competent," "competent" "and" understandable "," as an extremely expert teacher, who provided the boys regularly with cakes, cookies and bonbons. "</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority is complained about his perfectism and its high Emotionality, which led even to wasps."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"he did not only threw the chairs not only with chairs and throwing the keys to the ground, but also went earnest guys to the hair or ears, he himself regretted and apologized for himself."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, to his honour of honour, it must be said that such educational methods were common in fractional time, the 1960s and 1970s, widely used, with parents as at teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also have experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what's happening in this report, the adventurous sexual abuse and violence at the preschool, are the free excavators."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"one asks, if it is not more likely to do with his acquaintness and his role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media has just gone on him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"a lot of people who never understood him on the Bavarian Pope, still eagerly awaited."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report entail Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, in connection with the report much about the subject of misuse at the" "Regensburger Domenatzen" report. "</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger also be placed in the final report with regard to sexual abuse on sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted the Domenellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother," "said one affected representative for the others," It was all very embarrassing. "</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem of the Enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they did not commit to parents and siblings, then not a choir director, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domenatzen station Ratzinger's role in terms of misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it like this: "I see... no case in which he would have had his findings and could have been able to stop the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I hold it... also for really absurd to assume that out of it... Buben enetrable or clearer or rather opened, than compared to their parents, internatants, confidentiality teachers etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="2941">"so the report comes to the very clear result:" "that he was confided in advance in advance and / or their environment, could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as regards sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is shared by every fellow worker."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"so he cannot be accused of having taken him, or brought him to the ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to bring his good name to these contradicting crimes in connection, as unfortunately happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, much of" violence in the "" Regensburger Domenatzen "was much to read."</seg>
<seg id="2946">He was accused of the former Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this allegation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem, that in the coverage everything was mixed and confused to a huge melange from sexual abuse and violence and anywhere, in the middle, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that's exactly what is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"it is clean up separately: between the preschool and the high school of the Domspines, between sexual abuse and violence as well as, let's say, rest."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report incidents from the period since 1945, thus also out of four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir director of the Dommoatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the entire awful test pedagogy, the cases, in which boy from sadistal teachers have been confined and tolerated, all at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where really skinous states must have dominion."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with them Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, for he got the boys only on her face when she had already been at the Domspatzengymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"it was, like most of the most witnesses, the theme of" Preschool "tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise of paradise."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different about the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: indeed, there was discipline, but no sadistal violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that" many victims had estimated the general humanity of R., and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"thus, at most, the accusation must be looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"however, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which the conditions were reported on the preschool."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he started to establish itself and from the predecessors at a school that he did not work and was responsible (such as the witness), and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"before the conditions, Georg Ratzinger completed the ears consistently?"</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium who even reproduced the report."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this, he points out to this point," that in the preschool, the test will continue to practised. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">"even in view of the risk of negative press, he recommended urgent income."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"of course, that was, of course, at a time when legal clarifications had long been banned in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they occurred in a legal grey zone, how each of us is still white."</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was also hard to estimate that those affected might be exaggerated or dramatic and where really the permissible border was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">"one can't say, but he would have ever looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">That is just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the test of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria from Thurn und Taxis claimed, it is unfair to apply today's educational standards to the then time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann says: we speak historians from the" "snare of Anachronism," so the danger of the past to today's moral measures. "</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this is of course not true for sexual abuse, which was aborted to all times and not for what was broken in the preschool of resistance and violence against innocent children, this goes far beyond that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">It's all awful and I'm glad that it is finally done.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger protection, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"its means to the disciplines and punishment, so they are celebrating earnest and in the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"as a physical punishment then it has been banned, he also has held strict confidentiality."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what is the picture of its kind of reggae, Georg Ratzinger was re-given to you for the book" My Brother of the Pope? ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of testing also included in the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, and the Domenatzen played only one minor role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless I didn't waste that he led a stringent regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but also this must be said once again: without these perfectism, without being unquestionable discipline, it would probably hardly been possible to form a global cultural ambassador in Europe and its musical tradition that went straight twice in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with cookies and Bonbons alone, one does not make a big singer and a great singer and every success in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-crossing."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people do you have experienced by Georg Ratzinger on the talks about their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: thanks to his work on the book and in addition, I met George Ratzinger really well and again as a wonderful, humorous, fundamental believer, deep believing and heart-good people, of whom you could not imagine that he could not do something of a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I regularly receive a regular contact with how many former Dommoatzen station today, 23 years after his Emergency Clinic, to visit him regularly - he is almost blind - and as a member of their family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who don't forgive him today, that he once been strictly to them, are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"today, most Domspines are grateful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he always had a good, paternal teacher - a stricter father, certainly which may be - but nevertheless a lovable respect to which they are still looking for."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again very clear: all that you ask for him are educational methods that were at the time of the agenda."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad we have overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is highly unfair, a man, only because he is prominently, and has an even more prominent brother to make the medial sinner."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intention that stands behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the report, which was just released, was discharged."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now, the annexation, a 93-year-old man who had acquired large service and without the outside of Bavaria and probably no one would probably know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
