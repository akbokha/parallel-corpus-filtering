Jennifer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
that Hollywood star has been clearly understood in an interview with the Hollywood star .
&quot; I always put in drawers , or receive from the outside label , which with me and reality usually have little to do . &quot;
&quot; I myself don &apos;t have the desire , always perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , these things are rather black . &quot;
Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh that they are considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as they explained in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
&quot; best wishes to play the actress at home , pre @-@ equipped TV with lo@@ cker@@ ish D@@ utt and Mexican food , is it in the magazine . &quot;

Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the pyramid of pyr@@ am@@ ids
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf course in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger visited a little variety of colleagues with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered her holiday , they hun@@ ted in the fast gal@@ lop of the food . &quot;
&quot; one kilometre at this speed , I &apos;m afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and so the horse career so ended again .
&quot; on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fers of all times - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses . &quot;
&quot; he led himself with his family on the facility of the AL@@ RV , on a horse , he didn &apos;t dare to look at the photo . &quot;
&quot; long was the first time in Aachen , with this also CH@@ IO . &quot;
the reason was quite convincing .
German Sports Aid persu@@ ades the husband from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala the Golden Sport@@ pyramid .
&quot; in awards , it does not lack the sympath@@ etic sport@@ s@@ men . &quot;
&quot; Federal Chancellor Cross , silver bay leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already touched him .
long is the 18th Prize winner of the pyr@@ am@@ ids .
&quot; on Saturday , he met the first prize winner of Hans Günter Win@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; this award means a lot , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; for it is not only for spor@@ tive successes , but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger promotes the offspring . &quot;
&quot; and so , he also gave the prize money of 25.000 Euros as well . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding sport@@ s@@ men , the two @-@ fold US champion won the &quot; Hall of Fame of German Sports &quot; on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; among these things , the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Turner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ ving , the Ru@@ th@@ ian Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ ush and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ ek@@ e , the Nu@@ bian Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the hand@@ maid of Erhard . &quot;
many of these sport scenes came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustr@@ ative Society mig@@ rated to the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ az@@ za prize ran . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger did gap to the great animals .
Clin@@ ics and Tr@@ um@@ ps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
&quot; investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement T@@ TP , both Clinton and Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; however , the two US presidential applicants are the case of tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question . &quot;
&quot; the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental , more philosoph@@ ical difference . &quot;
&quot; the , about the role of the state . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubts in doubt , and warns that the state can damage the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to climb the economy to death , and to death , he says . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , it would be quite different , asser@@ ting tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will return to reg@@ uli@@ ar massi@@ vely , and he is strong for a reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton said to him , &quot; The state has certain tasks to open , he has opened the dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities , and needs money for it . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s why taxes were raised to the rich , &quot; she says . &quot;
stakeholders are both very close to the topic of infrastructure .
&quot; the needs to be invested in the press , say Tr@@ ump and Clinton almost wor@@ t@@ fully . &quot;
the Democratic Can@@ didate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ odoro wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
so on tr@@ ump they could still be parties @-@ internal discussions .
clear@@ ances are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal power plants and continue to drive coal targets in the USA .
oil promotion is also possible to be possible in previously protected areas to termin@@ ate the Paris Climate Agreement .
&quot; by contrast , Clinton wants to extend the renewable energies with their investment programme : &quot; a country will create the super power of the clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; however , not only in infrastructure - also with international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ azi@@ fish trade agreements , would not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both the USA will not want to is@@ olate the international trade - but just protecting American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they should then be paid better then , too . &quot;
the present minimum wage of £ 7.@@ 25 be a famine .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what tr@@ ump is to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be , then he says he must not be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months probably is likely to develop the tax policy of both camps .
&quot; on one side is Tr@@ ump , who wants to pay the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics hold on him , so that the budget deficit would only get bigger . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton who want to ask at least from the rich man wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence . &quot;
&quot; sexual violence belongs to women who flee from alone , almost to everyday life . &quot;
&quot; if they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ matic . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a big kitchen .
&quot; each one has a baby , which is not one year old . &quot;
one has put their little son in the arm .
he looks curious in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es onto the table top .
until they notice that she is watching .
she sm@@ iles short and kissed the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk to Katrin B@@ ahr .
&quot; it is part of Con@@ dro@@ bs Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social aid in Bavaria , and deals with the subject of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen were wing@@ ed .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alized accommodations for all@@ u@@ ffed women and their children in Bavaria .
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment along with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Association . &quot;
&quot; long ago , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - also not as visitors .
the exception is an watch@@ man before the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who has come here , has made her escape with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars , because they are politically prosec@@ uted because they send torture or death , or because their families send them as a hop@@ eful to Europe . &quot;
&quot; in women , other reasons for the escape : &quot; many steal away secretly because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland , they have experienced experience with sexual violence , forced mar@@ riages , hon@@ oring slavery , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this drives them away .
&quot; on the run , that goes on . &quot;
&quot; for example , the tugs for a bottle of water demand an sexual action is not a rarity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe that once they arrive in Germany , she tells us . &quot;
there would also be one single women in refugee quot@@ as often as a min@@ der@@ ous and worst accident .
&quot; this leads to that about 90 percent of women who live in the north of the Munich north , estimates them . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntarily . &quot;
many women are so acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about Earth , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; as they often do not have to help , I need more accommodations for them , calls for B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven regional governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether they knew from a similar project , as in Munich within their scope of jurisdiction , say some with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz region and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is no such thing in the governments of the governments . &quot;
&quot; in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , women were not dis@@ counted separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press pre@@ sidents of the government . &quot;
&quot; in the Bavarian , Lower and Central Fran@@ ks , there are floors and private homes just for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations for women . &quot;
the committee on the rights of women and equality of the sexes : &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men .
&quot; in a study that has been published for the Committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot;
&quot; if the privacy or men are being accommod@@ ated , men and women are accommod@@ ated together , it may be - for@@ getting - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; above all the shower rooms should be separated and accessible to women , stands in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much feel the women of this protective needs can be felt at the And@@ res , which is located on the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since it has been talking about that there is a long queu@@ e , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could make a second home easily .
assistant denti@@ sts st@@ akes : demands for new jobs
&quot; deputy representatives of the assist@@ ants have called to their union , to ple@@ ad new workers with their disp@@ utes regarding a new contract . &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has requested its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work events from the beginning of September .
J@@ DC said that there had been a minister on the concerns about the contract .
&quot; in July , assistant doctors and medical students have agreed on the re@@ jection of a contract that has been agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Twitter on Thursday , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had said to have problems at any problems , which led the contract was rejected . &quot;
she said : &quot; considering that the J@@ DC Executive Board voted to complete the proposed new contract and calls the official new negotiations for all your concerns .
&quot; as a response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today has set a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to start a running program which starts in early September . &quot;
&quot; the disp@@ utes led to that assistance for assistance in this year , assistance in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; according to the election of the agreed contract conditions , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana joined the BM@@ A Regist@@ rar , which was recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he divided BM@@ A members during the meetings that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 assist@@ ants and medical students , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors would be forced to release in England . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of external sides &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give the hands and an official end of the eight months of war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ player in the gold @-@ plated audit@@ orium of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in reception , I cannot defend myself the reconciliation that Ankara wants most reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was a blow , yes . &quot;
but Putin sm@@ iled smile was nar@@ ro@@ wed and he sho@@ cked hard for his rest@@ rained conditions .
&quot; on the other hand , Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan spoke about his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report about five times . &quot;
I could not count it anymore .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only be able to return to their old level before the crisis , but even better . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan had happened so would never be something worst . &quot;
&quot; to me , his enthusiasm was obvious to indicate the opposite . &quot;
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s be@@ aming , sustainable bol@@ dness showed that the state of state of Russia had nothing to forget . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his entry : the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow from reaction to the time was w@@ ut@@ ent@@ bran@@ dy .
Putin divided and accused Ankara to fallen into the back .
&quot; the result was even bigger , since it was celebrated by a strange boy@@ friend . &quot;
the v@@ etr@@ ist re@@ building will be difficult when not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; in months , the state controlled media carried out a fierce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; at once , it seemed like the Turks would bear the blame for everything . &quot;
&quot; at the serious test , the accus@@ ations of senior officials had benef@@ ited from illegal oil dealers in territories of Syria , which will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he argu@@ ed this because of this .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
&quot; finally , this meeting was only taking place because Putin received the decision of Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a sort of victory .
for Ankara the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire lie clearly on the hand .
Erdo@@ gan is needed primarily every friends who he can get lost after last month at a failed coup d &apos;@@ etat .
&quot; again , terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him . &quot;
but there are also economic moti@@ ves .
&quot; Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights , each year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot;
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , travel agents and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resumed . &quot;
they are counting on a late seasonal attraction in the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week predicted the State television cheap fruit and vegetables , once the Turkish farm imports are allowed again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i form@@ ulated it like this : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West because of its reaction to the attempted power of power as a weak response .
&quot; to this end , the persistent Gro@@ ll on the Council of Acc@@ ession of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ping on it is to go out of cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
Russian state of state in Ankara won a bonus for a bonus that he demanded the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat for the elected State Organ@@ s .
&quot; for Moscow , this is well @-@ este@@ emed for Moscow a self @-@ sitting fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit meeting in this glorious palace at the seaside allowed it to Russia and Turkey , one as it once described me an analy@@ st &quot; &quot; Alliance of out@@ sides &quot; &quot; : two countries who disp@@ oss@@ essed themselves away from the West and are badly treated . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still large differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave himself the role as peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support mutual pages . &quot;
&quot; it could be reve@@ aling , that after almost three hours , both pre@@ sidents go to the press conference , they said that they didn &apos;t even compreh@@ end the subject . &quot;
&quot; the president of Turkey ver@@ mi@@ ed it on a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ize this . &quot;
there is no unique con@@ sensus about which a common denomin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open host@@ ilities - and in view of the potential for a complete dis@@ aster , as NATO member Turkey ab@@ rupt the Russian battle jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state will talk at least once again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside of Scotland are no longer available
&quot; according to Chief Executive Officer of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand is to be reduced to more on a back@@ office roll . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan divided the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global amb@@ itions .
the bank has since dist@@ anced since eight years ago and had to be saved .
&quot; in this period , brand names &quot; R@@ BS &quot; is used to protect other end @-@ power supply brands . &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds on sponsor@@ ing from Six Nations Rug@@ by until Wimbledon winner Andy Murray .
but now she has decided to put out more national brands in the focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised head office and the IP@@ West can change . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are others , smaller stamps for the private customer business that will receive more significance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ EW@@ AN was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness Shi@@ re .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will be engaged to our Invest@@ ors brand , as well as the brand , among which our employees will be busy , since we now become more to a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS has been used to global mark . &quot;
&quot; now , I say that we do not pursue global targets , but pursue local goals . &quot;
&quot; each of these stamps will be in their own communities for something completely different , and our employees will work among these brands with the customer . &quot;
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue its Six Nations Spon@@ sor@@ ing and that it will increase the perc@@ ep@@ ti@@ bility of various brands in its Sport @-@ Spon@@ sor@@ ing .
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands , as we are looking forward to do this inside ( we asked ) to do this to a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical three years ago , when we said we had to be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think we will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can re@@ launch these brands , so I think that the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori arrives on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction to its 3.@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spray champagne after a double in New@@ market , which brings him 3.@@ 000@@ th win &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured its 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market . &quot;
&quot; he put on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth Jo@@ ckey , who reaches the milestone in the flat race . &quot;
&quot; he succe@@ eds Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the dre@@ im@@ ali@@ ge winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won at G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I &apos;m very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed about 30 years ago .
&quot; it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday night with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori took the che@@ ers when he re@@ covering the victory at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
&quot; two Jo@@ ck@@ ey@@ s reached the milestone in the obst@@ acle race , Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired twenty @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , the nin@@ ete@@ enth Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger , had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career training &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern@@ ity and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone in just a few years ago .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ le@@ ct that distingu@@ ishes him from the other in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma loved fans for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I told Frank@@ ie some weeks ago with Ep@@ s@@ om that he would have taken 6,000 win@@ nings , if he would not only have a weekend and grand@@ child yo@@ ke ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already lost almost 30 years of winning players in the UK .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition , he is an incredible yo@@ ke . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the suspension of British flat screen for two decades . &quot;
it was annoying .
&quot; a whole range of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; glorious seven &quot; in 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he initially had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month semen , but showed an impressive characteristic strength to de@@ stru@@ t its branch and to return to its best form . &quot;
and he &apos;s not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori had once said that he wants to continue studying in competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ 53 years ago .
Russia Putin ta@@ xed Chief of Staff Serge@@ i IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V
the Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was a lot of years part of Putin &apos;s close confidence .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as a special representative for environmental and transport affairs .
&quot; in a review of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that Putin made his duties for the release of Ivan@@ ov@@ s by his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was deputy in Ivan@@ ov@@ s , has been appointed his successor since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital , Tall@@ inn , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IM@@ O ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy . &quot;
&quot; on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it &apos;s ( in Russian ) that he later was chief of the head of the head of the Prime Minister . &quot;
he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
I think it is the main task of the government to support your activity as state of state and inspec@@ tions on the implementation of your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday with that IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V asked about to leave his position and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ y IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was a long time one of the closest colleagues Vladimir Putin and works as he works for Soviet intelligence service in the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
&quot; at a meeting with President Vladimir Putin was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff is on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile of the cameras , only few of them are convinced - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so here is the result of a sort of power struggle ?
nobody knows that .
but the official claim - that a man who once turned to be a potential president who wants to lead Russian environmental policy - pushed into large sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism .
&quot; in his remarks on Putin that are quoted on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V said , &quot; &quot; IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V &quot; &quot; is true that I asked you in the beginning of 2012 in a conversation , I could almost tell me this very complicated post - you could almost say - coated post four years . &quot;
&quot; as it comes out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
&quot; previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin became ex @-@ member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Bund@@ essi@@ bility Service ( FS@@ B ) , the K@@ GB , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was appointed to his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V as one of five people whom he trusted most . &quot;
&quot; once it was assumed that IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V might have been President of Russia &apos;s second term in Russia , as a third term of Putin had to put Putin against the Constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this item was taken by another , leading ally Putin &apos;s allies , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;

Queens@@ bury Crossing Crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
&quot; engineers have connected the North deck of the Queens@@ dies , Cros@@ sings to the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe . &quot;
&quot; it is the first of four verses of the &quot; deck blo@@ wers &quot; which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
&quot; it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , and 46 wires . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; today , the construction of economic affairs Keith Brown visited a visit today and was one of the first that went from the country to the bridge . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queens@@ el Cros@@ sings . &quot;
&quot; we are all witnesses of a engineering at a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30.000 ton of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the flow between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of all bri@@ ck@@ les in their place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks gets into Ros@@ y@@ th a bet@@ ong@@ uss for the deck , meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to the bridge at its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ stru@@ ctors said : &quot; the first cl@@ asp represents a significant milestone for each bridge project . &quot;
&quot; with this fantastic project , the cl@@ asp is looking forward to looking forward @-@ looking high and deep @-@ construction . &quot;
&quot; following the installation of the final finish line and the connection with the north tower deck , we had to close the still existing gap on the North or Land@@ side . &quot;
this was achieved by pulling the northern shore bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and very delicate activity .
&quot; massi@@ vely massi@@ vely , since the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 meters long , weighs about 6,000 tons , and had to be moved up to approximately 3 % . &quot;
&quot; he@@ ats , as toler@@ ances , on which the team works , were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters . &quot;
luck@@ ily everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; luck still alive &quot;
three men have to be &quot; happiness still alive &quot; after they were thrown from her fishing boat from Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station proposed Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alert after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulty to swim in safety , while their boat moved from their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and turned the worst , &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately the strong winds have already blo@@ wn out of their range , until we left water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found on a Bo@@ je . &quot;
&quot; they were all taken on board of the coastal boots , and were brought back to the rescue station . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men who were cast into the water , were lucky and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat engine had an emergency stop , however , the bo@@ wing of the bo@@ ots of the person lo@@ osed from the person who ste@@ ered the boat . &quot;
someone has seen over these men today .
seriously injured - man impres@@ ses on his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
&quot; as a police yesterday , the 50 year old had given the key to the apartment to get his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
instead of non @-@ alcoholic do@@ ers the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend instead .
&quot; when this came into the apartment , he stab@@ bed it twice to them . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and the body .
the police could capture the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; during the 50 year old , he destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother . &quot;
this al@@ armed with his sister .
&quot; together with their partner , the 45 year old wanted to calm their brother . &quot;
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with their living .
&quot; on the street , they met the ex @-@ partner of the man . &quot;
&quot; as the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year old his sister stood on the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who builds Braun@@ schwei@@ gs cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Gre@@ ens my : investors should become a lot more strongly in the future .
how do you react to the bad news that Bruns@@ wick in the next few years will lose almost 1,300 apartments ? &quot;
the SPD proposes the next rat@@ chet &quot; concept for action . &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
first of all this is about the question : who should build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing .
&quot; Christoph Brat@@ mann writes : &quot; &quot; we are involved with the Gre@@ ens : &quot; who wants to build on urban areas , 20 percent of all apartments must be found as a social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the affordable housing can also occur in inventory . &quot;
&quot; however , the great host point in the town hall was however , so viol@@ mann : &quot; how are you going to build up with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want to build investors on such areas at least 10 percent , but 20 percent of the apartments are as a social housing . &quot;
a new residential building of residential building program that will cost millions and will still be financed for inc@@ enti@@ ves .
&quot; the problem , so viol@@ mann : &quot; there are currently no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CDU wants to be investors as far as few rules .
the left aims to increase hardness requirements for investors .
&quot; regardless of what , the Brat@@ mann , has a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; the concept concept is implemented , and will ensure additional tasks in the construction management . &quot;
more staff is required .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; however , the program does not stand completely : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new homes should be built . &quot;
&quot; but how does one compare the loss of another around 1300 economical apartments , whose progress will run in the next few years ? &quot;
by 2020 there will be 500 apartments .
&quot; to prevent this , the plan@@ ter spokesperson Nicole Palm , should now be sold out of the city now . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought to recover apartments back into the price binding . &quot;
this is possible in the West town .
&quot; on a blow , the problem can be solved . &quot;
&quot; because in the western city , around the end of the year . &quot;
around 1800 apartments could be back into the pricing for cheap apartments .
only : that &apos;s the owners who do not want to build houses .
&quot; because the number of the social dwellings in the West@@ stadt is dra@@ stically increased , it is removed from the goal of the so @-@ called sl@@ ump @-@ mix . &quot;
there will no longer be a concentration of social weak in just a few districts .
the Green Party anticip@@ ates that there will be movement in discussion .
&quot; Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke writes : &quot; a broad majority must be the CDU with the boat . &quot;
&quot; in fact , these have been concentrated on more construction sites for single family homes . &quot;
but what does not mean that there is no com@@ promises yet to be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , worth it &quot;
&quot; it is fascinating , how the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in the last decade , teen@@ ager and child don &apos;t want to go outside , but rather to spend their leisure time , on screens , was compl@@ ained by many . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about to get people from the sofa and get more active .
&quot; at the beginning on screen , the screen was on TV set , then on video games and most recently on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities do not exclu@@ de each other . &quot;
&quot; of course , I put myself on the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters , which initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( and later developed a drawing series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; how many phenomena of pop culture fell to the interest of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July . &quot;
&quot; the market launch in other countries has been moved by massive demand , which over@@ load the server . &quot;
&quot; within days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users than Tin@@ der and nearly as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the player with their smart phones are going outside and looking for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons that were followed with a GPS and once they were found once , &quot; &quot; ( over a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game , when she was still younger , joined the W@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps , which returns the &quot; average &quot; person every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ ac , an app for Apple Watch , followed by the Washington Post , recently told the Washington Post , that within two days following the market launch of the game , the number of people followed by 45 percent to 53 percent every day . &quot;
the company doesn &apos;t know who playing Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it &apos;s only the resource data for performance auction .
&quot; many public recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance campaigns for health , people want to bring about 30 minutes to take &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; every day to be active &quot; &quot; in deaf ears because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look like . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be assessed . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drives sport , reduces its chances to become cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages that is too long to lead them here . &quot;
but the wonderful to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open that makes them fun .
&quot; thus , three pillars of health covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine and fun . &quot;
some people join the hunt even new friends .
&quot; as always , there are also m@@ ür@@ rical players who have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what should I do ?
it has been a breakthrough .
&quot; even if Smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit had already been able to follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to exercise sport like this game . &quot;
the new becomes losing its appeal and the use will be re@@ directed at the time .
&quot; due to Pok@@ em@@ ons success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activity in real world and will help many people on the hunt , active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier . &quot;

and now the Olympic @-@ singer finally arrived .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in cler@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the multi @-@ campaign and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spot@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their overall score of 6@@ 2.@@ 198 was clearly found in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team painter A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; the Americans Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ neth on the Swe@@ de bal@@ es during the individual campaign of women at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American writer , winning a multi @-@ championship titles and a total of the fifth during which they consoli@@ date its reputation , the best of its generation or even at all . &quot;
&quot; it broke out in tears , when their final result was shown and their long journey was at the end . &quot;
this success makes it in the same league as unique athletes as Michael P@@ helps who brought their sports to new heights :
&quot; Bil@@ es domin@@ ates its sport in the last three years - including 10 gold medals , including 10 gold medals , which include a mixture of amb@@ ition and precision , that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on said that she was &quot; the best gy@@ mn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it expected to be an final exam in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athl@@ ete , but rather between her and a last over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not return with a hand@@ ful gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered dis@@ appointment . &quot;
&quot; the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace the women having won gold and silver in the individual campaign of women at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; in the event of retirement , Bil@@ o took the first medal in retirement of the retirement party , Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i served as an ex@@ clamation mark . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted on top of their long way on the top , never the future is planned , this is not really true . &quot;
a part of its floor exercises - which included their typical tum@@ bling pass - is available in Latin American music that would fit home at home outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child , and was discovered by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans &apos;s mother during a school tour in the gym , was trained in Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , it has no longer lost any surplus competition , winning a victory in which it wishes for so long as in the summer of 2013 . &quot;
&quot; even when Must@@ af@@ ina was slightly damaged by two rot@@ ations , the picture was dec@@ ep@@ tive . &quot;
Schwe@@ be@@ bal@@ es and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es holds the world champion title - l@@ ur@@ king the world .
she repeated again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the Swe@@ de again - and he sat on the ground with an 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently when she expected their En@@ der@@ ial - a pure mol@@ ality - and tears came in Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision they once described in her collection book . &quot;
&quot; the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was ven@@ ge@@ ance for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal was in a depth of Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old man who is called O@@ ma called &quot; O@@ ma &quot; will lead a lead .

police : 3 victims in standard mur@@ der@@ ers shot at the car in the car
&quot; according to police reports , which were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl shot dead in one of the dead@@ liest attacks in the first series of serial attacks since one decade , while they stopped in the car and heard music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Merkel liner , Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a drive , the authorities told . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rators fired eight shots from a hand weapon , while he was standing on the passenger side of the car , and then fled with another vehicle , is in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police told that the triple murder does not seem to have been the result of a pre@@ dat@@ or , as the att@@ ack@@ ers did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which were in possession of one of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the police officer of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting was directed to investig@@ ators a further view , whether they are connected to four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; altogether , seven civilians were killed and two others were injured in nine months in nine attacks in nine months . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; shared Howard der K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln . &quot;
&quot; the investig@@ ators refuse to expos@@ e the evidence that they are linked to the conclusion that the attacks are linked , and were committed by the same mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ itali@@ zed due to her injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site . &quot;
&quot; a witness divided by the police , that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ted car and listen to music . &quot;
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting of shooting , which was targeted at an empty Pick@@ up truck a half hour before the triple murder , and it is assumed that it was the plant of series production . &quot;
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro @-@ cephal@@ y : &quot; better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old loves Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to the singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the fe@@ west of his retirement , Edmund Micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , knew nothing about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home the first time , my first thought was , I create it not . &quot;
I don &apos;t create that .
I didn &apos;t let me leave .
&quot; what is not right at all -- of course , one has left itself , &quot; she said . &quot;
her husband Vincent and her husband was told that Edmund might never know them under circumstances and that he may not survive once again .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institutional him .
&quot; my first answer to this was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people are still doing , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Edmund can run with help to help .
&quot; Edmund could neither sit nor cra@@ wling up to his third year , but he can &apos;t speak yet . &quot;
but it is getting slow progress .
he can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the drawing language that Edmund for &quot; Please sing something to me . &quot;
&quot; we bring him the drawing language , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical character language -- it says . Edmund has invented some signs alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ y has a wide variety of causes : genetic as with Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or c@@ ic@@ avirus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it &apos;s still too early to say how to influence life with the Z@@ ik@@ avirus In@@ infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I asked what is going to happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
&quot; I have no longer asked for the forecast for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect it to really say to me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for pregnant women with birth damage caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avirus .
it is better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy rain@@ falls , flood gives occasion to rescue life in Louisiana , Mississippi &quot;
&quot; heavy rainfall and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Louisiana forced the governor to call the emergency , on Friday the emergency was reck@@ oned on with more rain@@ falls . &quot;
&quot; numerous rivers in the south @-@ east Lou@@ is@@ anas and the south of the gu@@ pp@@ is flooded their sho@@ res and threatened with widespread floo@@ ding in extreme rain@@ falls , reported the national weather service . &quot;
&quot; the Governor of Louisiana , John B@@ el Edwards , communic@@ ated with the local authorities to stand in contact with local authorities and on the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a speaker for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Governor , shared with that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags . &quot;
ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a had requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used over wide parts in the south of Lou@@ is@@ anas through Saturday .
the weather service provided that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches could fall in rain .
&quot; on Friday , a flood warning system was used , while it continues to rain in the area . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Louisiana , are likely to reach record level after over the weekend . &quot;
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could over@@ flow many homes in the presence of Bat@@ on Rouge .
&quot; he also said that a down@@ ward @-@ down@@ ward floods in A@@ scen@@ sion Par@@ ish represents a danger , as these are only slowly flowing into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the river ticket ven@@ er@@ w , south of the Mississippi border border in Liverpool , Louisiana , reached the highest level ever recorded at 09.@@ 00 . &quot;
rescue teams still used people from the flood water in the district of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kinson in the South@@ west of Mississippi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed on Friday in the vicinity of Glo@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet from his house , rises above night . &quot;
&quot; he said that another step@@ son , who lives near , had warned . &quot;
&quot; we went up and bo@@ xed the water and po@@ or@@ ded in , &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
&quot; his wife said Hans@@ ford , that she lived there in the 48 years in which she had never seen such a flood of the river . &quot;
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had rescu@@ ed all three in a large military truck , and they had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday . &quot;
&quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood had spread themselves quickly , and there was still heavy rain@@ falls , and that government evacu@@ ation instructions would continue to consider . &quot;
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann a observer in the proximity of Living@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the ground has been fully developed due to the rain@@ falls since Wednesday .
the authorities reported that severe rain@@ falls and road floo@@ ding the rescue of inhabitants of their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a Par@@ ish and L@@ oss in five school districts .
&quot; in WW@@ L , the C@@ BS subsidiary of WW@@ L reported that a compound in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a 200 was attacked . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , which were both flooded now . &quot;
&quot; the fore@@ se@@ er of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller , said that the authorities were rescu@@ ed 72 people and seven pets which were r@@ ins@@ ed from floods . &quot;
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were arranged to accommodate evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; once the water starts to go back , they will return to their houses , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the city of Ham@@ mond of the municipality Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a , almost two dozen roads have been closed due to floo@@ ding and sand@@ bags for the residents for participation , that hope to keep the water from their houses and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last big flood that we had , was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems like a similar incident .
&quot; in some pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Count@@ ys said that it continues to rain on the gul@@ f . &quot;
&quot; according to its details , a hand@@ ful houses have been reported on Thursday as a flooded , but not reported on Friday until now . &quot;
&quot; Keith Town@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places where I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &apos; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; driven by balls , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
the police address that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy shot down in Philadelphia this week was already the second time that a 6 year old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grand@@ parents gave that Brown suffered several shots , including in the le@@ aning , leg , arm and belly , but that he was at his transportation into the hospital . &quot;
&quot; he has made a lot of pier@@ cing his little body of balls , divided his grandmother del@@ o@@ res mel@@ anch@@ z to the transmitter . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe that .
the condition of the boys was classified as a critical hospital and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the boy &apos;s family shared the transmitter with that he is expected to recover again .
he was supposed to start the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
&quot; three men were shot at the age of 29 , and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition , with the other two victims , according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in the stable state . &quot;
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 year old , who found himself in a critical condition , the station tells . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police had just determined whether one of the injured men of the perpet@@ rators might be .
investig@@ ators divided C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently had come to a cross @-@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
&quot; pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , who were tra@@ ced to different assault ri@@ fl@@ es , passed the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that there have been clearly tra@@ ded by a constant struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the side@@ ways , were envelope . &quot;
&quot; so there seems to have been several armed fighters to have been involved , who were very actively involved , &quot; shared police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia . &quot;
several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area .
&quot; there was no arrest and the police currently checks reports , according to the surveillance video . &quot;
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl hit by a ra@@ cket on the arm when she played in front of her house in the area of West O@@ ak Lane .
they recover and the police are looking for a susp@@ ect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I present myself under the women &apos;s Olympics in the Tur@@ ns and that from more than one reason .
&quot; first of all , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant . &quot;
&quot; secondly : this team has three gy@@ mn@@ ast , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls with other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din and Madison Ko@@ cian , which is Cath@@ o@@ lik@@ in , complete , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team is finally reflected the United States .
it has held the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the head of this sport .
&quot; over the last four years , number one was one A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman . &quot;
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
&quot; at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion in America and America . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three @-@ fold world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they expected unexpected , but master@@ ful Gy@@ ma@@ stics rout@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman , who won gold in an individual combined event for women gold . &quot;
member of A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the tip of this sport , but we don &apos;t see the turn@@ tables in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie struck all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympics is only four towers in the crew . besides , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality is so that Tur@@ ns is a more expensive sport and Turner will join the first line in private gym , which will be charged for training , setup , travel and hotel costs ( for the coach and their Turner and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ tables are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these verses , Turner will receive their entire training and this is a expensive and long @-@ term commitment for families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , train@@ ee of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer by Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both have trained their athletes since she started with the Tur@@ ns . &quot;
&quot; we need to host the communities Au@@ n inn@@ um@@ erable , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , providing a powerful and easy @-@ to @-@ accessible gy@@ ms . &quot;
I founded my gy@@ ro foundation 20 years ago .
&quot; during my events , we have offered free and affordable Tur@@ ns in Harlem for more than 15,000 people ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth of high quality tur@@ tles , which deserve the opportunity to learn from this amazing Olympic sports . &quot;
&quot; tower develops strength , flexibility , and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the Spirit . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health and educational and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , who bring thousands of young girls to interest , and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is an exciting time .
&quot; thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you , F@@ ass her so many young girls with different background to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistance doctors want to organize further strikes after having rejected Jeremy Hun@@ ts proposal
&quot; the minister were hoping to end the dispute over the changes due to a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7,000 assist@@ ants who vote in a vote le@@ ak him . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hunt &apos;s plans were reve@@ aling the contract and said that the N@@ HS would be united in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assist@@ ants should receive a new contract , which contains modifications to night and weekend work to improve maintenance times . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the Chairman of the BM@@ A Com@@ mitt@@ ees to Regist@@ rar , last night in a communication with : &quot; assistance doctors have agreed to the proposed contract , especially serious concerns , in particular that it will be able to meet all doctors . &quot;
&quot; only eight weeks , who still remain , until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , you need to make progress and the time runs out . &quot;
&quot; efforts to benefit from the BM@@ A to solve the disp@@ utes through discussions in the government of withdrawal , and sometimes on ear@@ marked silence . &quot;
&quot; this was done by a promise that Jeremy Hunt took only last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
&quot; Jeremy Hunt must act now , raising the penetration and concerns the concerns of assistance doctors . &quot;
&quot; if he should not do this , the assist@@ ants have made clear that they are ready to perform other work@@ stations . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw an out@@ feed of almost 13.000 rout@@ in@@ oper@@ ations and 100,000 appointments , since nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to grant doctors on the string of strike . &quot;
the ministers had been hoping to end the dispute over the changes due to the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants to be a better week re@@ mun@@ eration for the 5@@ 4.000 assistance systems that are subject to the contract .
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ si , Director @-@ General of the N@@ HS employees , demanded the assistance of assistance to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ rie said : &quot; &quot; working measures can &apos;t reach anything of the only little , but already loaded up teams and service providers and prepare for patients , nursing and their families only wor@@ ries , emergency and interru@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; over the past two months , we talked to the assistant of the assistant , and with the Ministry of Health as well as other minist@@ ries were positive to the concerns regarding the pre@@ m@@ und@@ y and the W@@ hist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the employers had hop@@ ed that continuing positive commitment to other important topics - such as disp@@ uting , flexibility in training , training centres and the gender of training , training centres , mutual recognition of the teaching , education , health education and the Ministry of Health , concerning compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;

&quot; around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer a heart attack or a stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by inc@@ entive gre@@ thal@@ ates material in the arter@@ ial walls .
&quot; if the layer breaks , there is a blood cl@@ ots causing blood flow to the heart and caused a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; if the blood cl@@ ots solves , it can flow through the blood flow and the blood flow to the brain , which causes a stroke . &quot;
&quot; people who already had a heart attack , are subject to a higher risk . &quot;

fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of one person .
&quot; experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in the reduction of further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people , who already had a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; due to a preliminary review by T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are looking forward to extend treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . code design recommends no treatment that proceeds over this period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness acc@@ edes to Muslim areas in Muslim areas
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on leaving a government report because of corruption from the office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness has led to the widespread electoral fraud in Muslim congregations will be ignored as a devastating government report today .
&quot; according to Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es , the former office of Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and town houses , evidence of elec@@ tual abuse of &quot; belie@@ fs concerning eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; former minister of integration and municipal government , which is now an anti @-@ corruption scandal , said that the in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious moti@@ ves should be so bad that the police should be allowed to set out lock@@ ers outside of electoral cables . &quot;
&quot; he recommends that voters should lead a reference to their identity , in order to prove their identity . &quot;
&quot; at present , voters must only call his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report suggests , non @-@ remove ink on the fingers of a person if they give their electoral voice to prevent someone will choose twice . &quot;
&quot; W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer should receive more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
it demands that the press should have more access to community records and decisions of un@@ official comm@@ est@@ ees or working groups .
&quot; this does not only serve against electoral fraud , but should also protect the communist government in front of the bro@@ ader corruption and financial services , which is thus protecting , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was ordered by Do@@ wning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets electoral sc@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year a special court ruled that the re@@ ig@@ ning Mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man after a lit@@ an@@ ei to corrupt and illegal practices of his am@@ ends should be revealed .
the court found that Rah@@ man would have inherited the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ n@@ ical manner &quot; and that he would have put his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; Rah@@ man should &quot; &quot; have led his campaign on the basis that it would be the cor@@ related obligation of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 voices were either doub@@ tful or a consequence of a desc@@ endant , where one person cho@@ oses someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there was no evidence throughout the country .
&quot; in particular , he expressed itself al@@ ar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent post@@ age - where older members of the Muslim community had made pressure to people to choose one candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to su@@ cking the electoral system , including the Leadership of To prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report , it says : &quot; as proof was appropriate to elect members of some ethnic minorities , in particular women and young people to vote in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ese or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions such behavior would have ignored such behavior because of &quot; politically correct &quot; sensiti@@ v@@ ities regarding eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric said 50 Recommend@@ ations to make the system clean , including the prohibition that political activists have to deal with &quot; electoral harvest . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is drawn from Ther@@ esa May in consideration , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral directory for immigration and social @-@ duty purposes . &quot;
&quot; get into account , voters want to ask for your identity . &quot;
&quot; do not use remote ink on the finger of a person once they delivered their voice , to avoid that someone cho@@ oses twice . &quot;
systematic checks of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are optional .
a three year @-@ year limitation on applications to an automatic mail @-@ election .
ban on account of political activists in general election and envel@@ opes .
&quot; in the police , give the control of setting the locking stations . &quot;
&quot; a change of Law , which facil@@ it@@ ates an accus@@ ation for in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation according to the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( Volks@@ zeitung Act 1983 ) . &quot;
photographer prohibition in election stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the election stations ( except for Wales ) .
&quot; intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the employees take the rule that voters will go alone in the election cabin . &quot;
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case does not have a criminal complaint .
&quot; the electoral court has said Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy , due to a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practice as un@@ fit , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons for in@@ adequate , according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings - found guilty . &quot;
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ control &quot; of the Rath@@ geber .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the Court of Justice in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country carries a proud heir as the mother of par@@ liam@@ ents , but the wor@@ r@@ ying and conce@@ aled spread of electoral fraud and leu@@ g@@ ings of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ double @-@ off@@ ence and other famous semi @-@ spe@@ ars from the Olympic Games in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio have shown this week over the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot except edge and band who has proved to be an impressive double @-@ off@@ ence of the Du@@ chess in Cambridge .
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic champion is far not the only one to have gold fighting Ath@@ en@@ ians who has his own famous bi@@ kers - at least not , if one may give the social media faith . &quot;
&quot; in honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces in the Rio 2016 Olympic Games , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a list@@ ings to Olymp@@ ion@@ a@@ ics which feature more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood @-@ Hollywood pages . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ l@@ ison , on the left , is compared to Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood . &quot;
&quot; except K@@ ates double @-@ off@@ ence on the wheel road , many people had the Internet on the internet , like a certain ar@@ cher of the dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be . &quot;
the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ l@@ ison has caused a attack on Twitter after pictures where he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ cann@@ y .
&quot; in fact , the arch@@ ery got the mad@@ ness in the social media with and gave that he has been able to hear from his childhood , that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I see no great simil@@ arity , except the facial hair@@ y , &quot; shared Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a great looking guy , so I can do that as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; one of the most popular compar@@ is@@ ons since London 2012 will undoubtedly occur more into the focal point : the explo@@ iting simil@@ arity between Britain &apos;s wide jum@@ per Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris . &quot;
&quot; Russian Tur@@ ner@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its large , expres@@ sive eyes should be able to pass through the Cuban American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
&quot; and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared to the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison . &quot;
a gear higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version of the In@@ c@@ eption actors
&quot; another compar@@ ing comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h hard , who has similarly severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver medal in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points out more than just the sun@@ b@@ illed skin and bl@@ on@@ ise hair as the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was attacked by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope solo , left , and Dexter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter User was very happy that others like the simil@@ ar@@ ities
&quot; theory in space : according to this user , there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pa@@ ares . &quot;
a Twitter U@@ ser@@ in declared their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular distributors of Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and their smile , which is almost identical with the actress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ ns Gab@@ by Douglas , which has its own beautiful , wide smile that resem@@ bles it to Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;

the comm@@ ent@@ ator Byron Mac@@ Don@@ alds thought that his microphone is turned off when he served his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m free styl@@ ised .
&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought into the comm@@ ent@@ ators of C@@ BS on board to give more &quot; &quot; color &quot; &quot; could be heard : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; up to excited , like M@@ ief , he died like a pig . &quot;
thanks for this .

&quot; spect@@ ator in all Canada re@@ acted quickly , after they were sho@@ cked by the tone and language . &quot;
&quot; Emma &apos;s Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Hat the C@@ BC comm@@ ent@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ wimm@@ ers from China &quot; like a pig died ? ? ? ? &quot;

&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was scientifically described in the final 4 x 200m free styl@@ ised garden for women . this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; the criticism against Byron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard , with him many of the speech given to him . &quot;
&quot; Twitter User beha@@ ved himself not , when they heard such as our en@@ si@@ bel Byron Mac@@ Donald &quot;
&quot; another Twitter U@@ ser@@ in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; Wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you currently represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like ra@@ assi@@ sts . # attached .
&quot; Scott Rus@@ sel , who presented the C@@ BC programme , was moderate , live for the comment from Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment on a swimming pool . &quot;
&quot; it was a un@@ fortunate formulation , I &apos;m sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC bur@@ ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end of over 90 times by people who answered B@@ emer@@ kt on Twitter
the comm@@ ent@@ ator Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
C@@ BC cop@@ ed and added his exc@@ use at more than 90 other Twitter Us@@ ers who compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald .
the network ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave a message .
&quot; we regret it , that these statements were made and made it possible to be aired . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our spectators at the fair and our fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in social media . &quot;
&quot; to make one clear , Byron &apos;s comments referred to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and un@@ fortunate chosen formulation . Byron is doing what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the con@@ sign@@ ment and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment for me to exc@@ use me for the comment , whom I made after the C@@ BC Olympic team , ap@@ ologi@@ ze , he said . &quot;
&quot; I spent on the performance of the swi@@ mmer , not in it as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no abuse is intended and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot;

&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; as I have joined , the employees tried to draw the clothes from the sale after she went - what exactly is the same . &quot;

how to protect against arms terms with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make him safer for you .
&quot; we talked to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to move with armed rob@@ bers at near distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or behind , this video will show you how you turn the sk@@ e@@ wer for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; if you are paraly@@ sed from behind , then you should turn your att@@ acker and go out of the Line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
grab the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; beat him then with the knees into the cas@@ est and rotate , while the att@@ ack@@ ers are pain@@ ed on pain , the weapon from his hands . beat him down with the barrel and move backward , while they set the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; for att@@ enti@@ ves that are approaching from the front , the technology is similar - move your body from the gun line , grab the weapon and turn it , so that the att@@ ack@@ ers can &apos;t shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , leave the weight on the gun and beat the att@@ ack@@ ers on the breast , then turn the weapon from its handle , before moving backward and set the weapon on him . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how to make Me@@ z@@ ra@@ chi fore@@ front .
but remember that it is with a rob@@ ber@@ y in the saf@@ est way to over@@ flow your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
travel Ian Wright sli@@ t for a guide for his tongue to the dirty places of Europe
a British tour under@@ lined his Imm@@ une System and Wür@@ ger@@ ef@@ lex for serious testing - taking place some of the most dirty and ec@@ ar@@ rests places in Europe .
&quot; the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k denied his course on a Euro @-@ scarf , a rail@@ ing on a pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a washing head of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system under proof . &quot;
&quot; in front of each object , he used an L@@ umin@@ ometer in order to show and show us what he will let . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; some surprising results of the light was released . &quot;
&quot; the thought that the r@@ ins@@ ing pot of a train toilet is used , which has already been used by thousands of others , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright said with doctors and medical experts on promoting intestinal bacteria , as well as its own health . &quot;
&quot; luck@@ ily , nothing left what he le@@ aked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr Wright became known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ines by going through the world , and did eat strange and wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public rail@@ ways to train stations to r@@ ins@@ ing r@@ amps of toilets , the task was definitely going to be the immune system definitely under one sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he told us : &quot; as a child , I was relatively in@@ worried about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and s@@ lu@@ dge water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was just a case in his reputation . &quot;
&quot; the only thing he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia . &quot;
its promot@@ er showed a lumin@@ omet@@ res of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ ometer is freshly washed @-@ washed hands less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to s@@ nails after their L@@ umin@@ ometric count came over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands one of less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; who shows the bacter@@ i@@ hood in different places like the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film , he says , &quot; This is the worst thing I smoked in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing more dirt than that !
I &apos;m not going on here because it is in@@ sol@@ itary here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producers of dairy products Vali@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company offers Mr Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the encour@@ agement of intestinal bacteria and immune system . &quot;
&quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories of N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer something new to the consumer . &quot;
&quot; something that is fascinating , and simultaneously the benefits of Pro@@ biot@@ ics explains . &quot;
we conducted crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings that ended that we said &quot; Let us call us Ian . &quot;
do you claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of just talk about the products , we wanted to place them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide more information on an interesting way .
I think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the direc@@ ting of the film , added : &quot; let me have lost my respect for Ian , if he would have reli@@ ed some of the things that I have instructed him , as the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet which is shown in the movie . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things where it was easier to bring Ian to swal@@ low them and others , with which this was pretty difficult . &quot;
I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats to film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by the survey conducted in 2015 , 84 percent of all respondents were associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent , that they may use at least occasionally products containing added lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; A@@ social family destroyed the social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; a as@@ ozi@@ ale family left their social apartment after a dol@@ og@@ ation with a damage in the amount of £ 50,000 because they had sho@@ cked their neighbours . &quot;
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ aun Tre@@ bil@@ cock were cast after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; having been removed violent from their property , sho@@ cked employees of residential gen@@ os@@ senschaft owned the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able state . &quot;
&quot; the walls were scre@@ ened holes , wooden di@@ spar@@ es were excited , tr@@ ash was stre@@ wed on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated on the walls . &quot;
&quot; the family have been res@@ ett@@ led , and it is thought that she lives in a private accommodation . &quot;
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the household administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she feared not to repair the apartment anymore . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; It was for people here an absolute night@@ mare and I am the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot;
&quot; there are many things to consider , since this estate is believed to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ walls . &quot;
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
&quot; the pair had three sons , who stayed in the apartment , and the police said that the terror which had added the family had joined the family , in@@ timi@@ date of residents , abuse of residents , drug abuse , drug traff@@ ick@@ ers and excessive scre@@ ams , spreading and flu@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an order for ant@@ iso@@ cial behavior in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house which will be demolished under circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found &quot;
&quot; there were tra@@ ded in the property , where drugs have been tra@@ ded in the past . &quot;
neighbours therefore said they had to fight on the streets and they regularly launched the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ og@@ ked her and her partner this week violent from the estate after she had an extended deadline of 11 weeks to get voluntarily .
del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbours who said that their lives were made to hell .
one said : &quot; they didn &apos;t care about anybody . &quot;
we lived for 20 years next to them and it was so bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today , we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we haven &apos;t lived here !
&quot; now , where it is finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it had the family to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house where the police was called in regular intervals , 20 years &quot;
on the covered side of the community house tr@@ ash and old toys were cast down .
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a dis@@ grace that the r@@ enters ab@@ um@@ ed , accept any responsibility for their behavior and to accept their family , as a del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot;
&quot; that was a very difficult case , as the behaviour of extreme and their actions had to be dre@@ ad@@ ful for their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community that have cour@@ ageous for us , and have done our information . &quot;
&quot; I hope that this development will don@@ ate some neighbours , and medi@@ ates the message that ant@@ iso@@ ara behaviour is not toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had been living at different times in the house , but that they are all over 20 . &quot;
a dirty mattress that lie down in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ og@@ ation on the floor .
workers of the house management now have to we@@ bs waste places that is surrounded by the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police led a raid in the house and found more than 70@@ g cannabis and orph@@ an@@ ages , par@@ ap@@ her@@ es and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don received a fine , after it was found guilty of the possession of a drug of class B in action . &quot;
she claimed that the money for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don was born in 2013 at a car accident .
&quot; after they were without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner is now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth . &quot;
many rooms of the house were gra@@ ded with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they will del@@ ve ten@@ ants that are not adher@@ ed to the house rules
&quot; Angela Cro@@ w was told by the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , that the del@@ og@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that do not comply with the assignment . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ accus@@ ations , as well as those who have been damaged by such a behaviour . &quot;
&quot; the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and ant@@ iso@@ cial behaviour , which continue to work with partners to protect our communities . &quot;

Donald Tr@@ ump dreamed : tremendous problems ″ in electoral campaign
&quot; the leadership of the U.S. Rep@@ ublic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , also in traditional federal states to interv@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; at the Presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump , weak@@ nesses of his election campaign in the Republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg Utah . &quot;
&quot; a rare moment , in which usually the most amazing and self @-@ confident m@@ ultim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire reported such as concerns how correspon@@ dent reported . &quot;
&quot; after having thrown 16 rival to his own Republi@@ can camp , his doubts grow to his success in battle for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; Tr@@ ump said to evangel@@ ical Christians who he asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; the wrong reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he returned to his famous media . &quot;
republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ ages
Utah is usually a safe bank for rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ USA in June , Tr@@ ump , and his compet@@ itor of the Democr@@ at , Hillary Clinton , respectively . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tr@@ ump ahead , but not with the distance that Republi@@ can candidates are common in the federal state . &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
&quot; in an interview of the transmitter CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question of how he wanted to stop Clin@@ ton &apos;s presence : &quot; just as I did it so far . &quot;
&quot; and if back : this will be &quot; either successful , &quot; or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t make different things as &quot; tell the truth . &quot;
&quot; if it is not rich for him on the grounds of political correc@@ t@@ ness , this is okay , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the Party of Tr@@ ump is intended to submit funds for the support of his election campaign , he should present no better environment values . &quot;
&quot; rather than that , the candidate of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans will attack stronger among the arms . &quot;
Olympia : three Sc@@ am sc@@ am at D@@ oping Test
the IOC wants to set up a discipl@@ in@@ arian commission .
Ken@@ yan was born after the second D@@ oping affair in Rio de Janeiro after the second D@@ oping affair .
&quot; following an attempt at a D@@ oping control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a trainer at home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee ruled together with promptly to establish a discipl@@ ined commission in order to investigate the case .
&quot; a ken@@ ian function@@ ary informed that the former Sprinter and modern coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village was a Ur@@ in @-@ rehear@@ sal under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ L@@ ame F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i . &quot;
this is the team @-@ line Ken@@ yan have been reported by D@@ oping controllers .
&quot; according to the IA@@ AF world association , the IOC has searched for information about the case to exac@@ ting his own studies , provided an IA@@ AF speaker . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the study and the following measures of the IOC , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; it said in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to D@@ oping control station , and has been issued as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , and signed the sample and signed , &quot; said Ken@@ yan chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p SO@@ I . &quot;
he was owned by the ac@@ credit@@ ation of the athletes who stood at the list of training controls in the world anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i had become more than 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
&quot; four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Athletics Championships Michael Rot@@ i was deduc@@ ted from the Rio games . &quot;
he should have informed about cash payments of his country on upcoming D@@ oping tests .
according to media reports he should have been arrested at his return at the Nairobi airport .
&quot; since a long time , Kenya has already been under special observation at the IOC . &quot;
&quot; during the announcement of the IOC to more than 2,000 D@@ oping target controls before the Rio Olympics , especially athletes from Kenya and Russia could be taken into the visor . &quot;
the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping agency had much pressure on African country in Brazil to create an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a working control system .
the Act was adopted a few weeks before Olympia @-@ began .
&quot; as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya accepted from the list of countries whose D@@ oping com@@ b@@ ating form with the rules of WA@@ DA are . &quot;
Kenya is considered to be a major runner nation .
the athletes of the country have won the most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of television reports the ARD will always be le@@ vi@@ ed , that in Kenya D@@ oping funds are easily accessible and there is a significant ment@@ ality of the sports bet@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the IOC member Richard Po@@ und asked for a similar investigation in Kenya , how he had put them in Russian athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in this sport , it could be demonstrated that in this sport area and systematic review was detected . &quot;
Russia &apos;s athletes have been excluded from the summer games .
Salz@@ burger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ Year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a trag@@ ical couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;

&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; the artistic director Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical in the Temple of classical music , filled with the role of Mary a Youth mare . &quot;
&quot; in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var orchest@@ ral Orchestra conducted by Gust@@ avo D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he is war@@ med . &quot;
we always say they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their temp@@ o and mel@@ ody .
&quot; it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
&quot; in this production , Bart@@ oli plays a little wor@@ shi@@ ed Mary . &quot;
she rec@@ alls with sad@@ ness to her beloved with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dance .
the role of Mary always fascin@@ ated me .
&quot; first , because it is unusual ! &quot;
and then Mary &apos;s personality would be .
&quot; she tells her in her song : &quot; I Fe@@ w Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I Fe@@ ty Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
&quot; so it is clever , naturally also na@@ ive , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; it resem@@ bles me very much , my Italian character I have as a Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
D@@ ud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such a honor for us to work with her .
she is a terrible man .
&quot; and Bart@@ oli are the compli@@ ment back : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conduc@@ tors is a necessity for him .
&quot; one sees it in each of his movements , in his bli@@ cks , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion , and a cheerful approach to life , that &apos;s very important at all ! &quot;
Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; uploaded : &quot; in this piece it is about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ at@@ ism .
&quot; today we have gone the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York inhabitants didn &apos;t want it . &quot;
&quot; these are the same themes , and today they are just as strong as at that time . &quot;

Turkey : Kurdish congregation reck@@ ons with mass cur@@ ses
&quot; whoever does not fit and Erdo@@ gan is engaged in packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the end of the Gü@@ len @-@ near foundation dialogue and world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; the Kurdish community of Germany anticip@@ ates a short term of tens of thousands of people looking for Turkey from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term , there could even be &quot; a few hundred thousand , &quot; the ally President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; due to the hard approach of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , the Kurdish congregation of Germany is expecting mass cur@@ ses to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in short term , with tens of thousands of thousands , in the medium term , with a few hundred thousand protective seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the World &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government had passed over months of Kurdish high @-@ bur@@ ns with pen@@ alties , 500,000 Kurds in Turkey remain on the flight . &quot;
&quot; after the injured p@@ utsch , another sec@@ ular and op@@ positi@@ onal ethnic Turks would add . &quot;
many will begin to start in Europe if they continue to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that even refugees , in own country refugees , said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the presi@@ ded officer accused the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab in Kurdish , but also in al@@ ev@@ it@@ ish cities . &quot;
&quot; with this , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the departure of the Kurds on the remaining Kurds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were exter@@ minated in the past hundreds of years or exp@@ elled , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who also became a CDU member . &quot;
&quot; the Government demanded that the federal government has positioned itself as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its supporters . &quot;
&quot; also in Germany , a &quot; wit@@ ch@@ hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critic is held . &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks are seeking asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition . &quot;
the fire mark@@ er as Gü@@ len followers are destroyed teachers and other acade@@ m@@ ics .
&quot; whoever does not fit and Erdo@@ gan is engaged in packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the K@@ em@@ alists and se@@ cul@@ aries , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation dialogue and education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as reported by calling on numbers of the Federal Ministry of Education , the Turks had already recognised the greatest group of asylum seek@@ ers in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; at the reporting date June 30 , this was 11.@@ 386 people and thus nearly 29 per cent of all participants are entitled to be recognised ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , not the war , poverty or el@@ tiv@@ e@@ pl@@ essness can be found . &quot;
&quot; asylum justified after the Basic Law are politically , i.e. by state side , individual understanding . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go there where it does &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the natives get nothing of the summer campaign - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country &apos;s day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood them .
&quot; in 2021 , the Sunday election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Swiss Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; so far as far as it does not exist : summer holidays , heat and day @-@ war struggle - that &apos;s what you do . &quot;
&quot; the loc@@ als , who are to be convinced by the electoral fighting ones , are on holiday . &quot;
&quot; most vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on Use@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not loc@@ als , so may not choose the country &apos;s Day . &quot;
&quot; to this end , practical problems arise : in the holiday there are hel@@ pers which hang out posters , ballo@@ ons infl@@ ating , fl@@ yers , and at the end of the vote , only fatigue . &quot;
&quot; until 4 September 2016 , the electoral and final day of the day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern needs to be over close to the people . &quot;
&quot; the hot stage , if you can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU Coalition , must be afraid of office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly in p@@ olls of the CDU . &quot;
&quot; as exciting , as strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of the low season . &quot;
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 Prime Minister , has an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign , one sees its big posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels across the country , ro@@ ses ro@@ ses and pl@@ au@@ ds a little with the people , like it had already been his legendary former predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , past@@ ering has gotten cold feet , and Chancellor Angela Merkel bl@@ aming the blame on the blo@@ om of Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; their refugee policy , you &quot; We create this &quot; have accelerated the rise of pop@@ uli@@ sts and what is thought to cost him now . &quot;
&quot; the CDU with its top candidate , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced as it is , if you make a wrong time at the right place for election campaign . &quot;
she has invited twice the German Chancellor Angela Merkel to major events ; Merkel the Bundestag is in the northeast .
&quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mec@@ kl@@ en@@ burger and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; since it was probably the majority of other federal states , Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently at N@@ DR . &quot;
but it too bad no man from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
otherwise the Nor@@ theastern CDU largely ren@@ ounces the usual election campaign in market areas and in front of shopping centers with umbre@@ llas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; that , Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; minor role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union also noted that in the country you need the basis , that it must be very strict , again to find a wire to the people . &quot;
&quot; you are just like the left , the SPD , the Green : in the times of the country hardly exist . &quot;
&quot; however , the Council of the CDU sel@@ com@@ ers Kok@@ ert to his fel@@ low@@ soldier is also self @-@ lar@@ v@@ ingly : &quot; they must go there where there are we@@ ar@@ ities , where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much in the game stands , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in the p@@ olls , S &amp; D Group recently added 22 percent of the CDU ( 25 ) of the CDU ( 19 ) and just just before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; at the election of 2011 , the SPD gained clearly with 3@@ 5.6 percent of the CDU ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the green , small party with seven percent in the p@@ olls , can be done the leap into the country &apos;s day . &quot;
they make a modern virtu@@ e of holiday emergency and lay their election campaign on the Internet .
&quot; at the online election campaign , &quot; he calls the president of Claudia Müller . &quot;
otherwise green election sho@@ ckers go to local stimul@@ ants under the vac@@ ations .
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ ek , the top can@@ di@@ in , cur@@ v@@ t just with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ bur@@ gian lakes and finds it even nice . &quot;
their impression : &quot; electoral holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 re@@ development : Gast@@ ro@@ wers suffer from blocking
&quot; at the speed , with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; the persons responsible for the persons responsible , which begin at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and start at 20 o &apos;clock in the morning , there is always praise praise . &quot;
&quot; they made everything pretty z@@ ack@@ y , &quot; &quot; El@@ vir@@ a T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff tells of the jet fuel station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no delay .
&quot; the construction site could be re@@ located at the beginning of the half @-@ time scheduled to the south end of October , everything will be completed by the end of October . &quot;
&quot; the items will also be praised for the construction work , approximately if it comes to the establishment of container ships . &quot;
&quot; since the building site moved to the south on Monday and also the lock of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was abolished and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has become relaxed , the traffic situation within the place is relaxed . &quot;
&quot; now , citizens can now move from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides . &quot;
the traffic through the place seems to be back .
&quot; there were partly significant symptoms , &quot; says the vice president of the general manager of Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bach@@ on@@ straße , Stein@@ k@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ ger@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many sle@@ epers sought and rather than the sign . &quot;
&quot; so , what led to some trucks in residential areas waste . &quot;
&quot; since the speed lim@@ ings have not been observed , the assembly demanded the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable adv@@ ances , &quot; says King , who himself had a location about the situation . &quot;
there are already two to three per minute lit@@ tered .
the fastest @-@ speed was on the road with 77 hour kilometers in the temp@@ o @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the building site has been continued , however , it was qui@@ eter . &quot;
&quot; for the business people at the B 27 , it is only a small sol@@ ace that is now open to customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; in the cards , business professionals don &apos;t like to look . &quot;
&quot; however , that the B 27 re@@ development of them has led to them for sales in revenues , everyone is asking you to see . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some less affected are affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; End@@ less &quot; , &quot; therefore , for other companies , has hardly any consequences for the rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; no more slight decline , &quot; but also dream that of course , &quot; the lear@@ ner is missing . &quot;
the local ones are the strongest along the street .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds significant words . &quot;
that is already exist@@ ential .
not only him but all guest facilities have made it hard . &quot;
&quot; the customers are missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil . &quot;
we must be happy about every Euro turnover .
net sales were reduced to &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot;
road orders have turned back his operation &quot; by two years .
he has to put away half of his employees .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and the half had been released , the policy would have re@@ acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt , on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , is whether there would be a financial compensation , with reference to the benefits of the situation at the B 27 . now she has to put the dis@@ advantages of the benefits offered by the restoration . &quot;
&quot; G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other farms , where something more generous has been handled . &quot;
&quot; in all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will pass on . &quot;
&quot; last@@ ly , the family business has already settled here for 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; these regul@@ ars are going to understand less frequently due to the complicated traffic management , so it can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you are not able , it is very different . &quot;
&quot; after the end of the rehabilitation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 construction work on its customers for the biggest crisis which has experienced its restaurant in their long@@ time history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction , this is brutal . &quot;
constantly in the name of the Terror@@ ism Act .
&quot; after the latest proposals , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , now a thick security package . &quot;
but what does a response status do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner tell all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the reconciliation .
&quot; all his proposals are reas@@ onably priced to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister at the launch of his new security package . &quot;
they do not require anybody .
&quot; other , further points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
&quot; also , I am involved . &quot;
&quot; as interior minister , however , it was on results and on a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sensus &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach passed a little time , before he presented his conclusions for safety in the Republic . &quot;
but these are the more extensive .
&quot; a lot is already known , pro@@ claims that a new security agency is to take care of the un@@ pack @-@ encrypted communication , is not new . &quot;
it is also not the fact that Germany needs to implement multiple EU directives for passenger data and ce@@ ase@@ fire .
the reputation after more video surveillance and staff for security agencies are also not surprising .
&quot; partly , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second start for proposals that would not have to do with the SPD : he wants to put sympath@@ ath@@ ering for terrorist groups under punishment and b@@ ade jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; that will be tough points for the SPD , &quot; the CDU man was dre@@ aming of the SPD . &quot;
&quot; however , he can still do it for reasonable and demanding nothing whatsoever in the Ko@@ al@@ ition@@ ist partner did not take any opportunities . &quot;
a few new ideas presents de Mai@@ zi@@ ère as well .
these are partly in itself : he plans quick trial for deportation and more possibilities to maintain people before deportation .
&quot; refugees that are fet@@ ched specifically to the country , should noti@@ fy their smartphone and make Social Media accounts for a security check before . &quot;
&quot; at Dul@@ ce for past asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to face some more worse than so far - such as those who commit crimes or their papers consci@@ ously throw away their identity . &quot;
&quot; a lot of it is politically , legally holy . &quot;
man@@ ches works even un@@ equi@@ po@@ res and lets questions open .
and with some points - in the ine@@ quality treatment of Ged@@ ul@@ fed for example - the question arises : what does it mean to do with safety and terror ?
&quot; yes , say de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics of refugees and terror . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not possible to address the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg refugees . &quot;
many people were worried about security in view of the high refugee camps .
&quot; and things , who are deeply involved in men , did not let them cling in election campaign . &quot;
the inner safety is enormous in the focus .
&quot; first the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the safegu@@ arding is large .
&quot; and yes , there are election campaign . &quot;
Union and SPD are becoming increasingly popular in position on inner security .
&quot; in recent days , there went up between the two parties . &quot;
&quot; only a gar@@ dener contro@@ versy over the equipment of the federal police , then on a safety @-@ political ideas collection of some labour @-@ interior ministers , in which the res@@ ort@@ ch@@ efs also demand a Bur@@ ka prohibition and a return from double citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is tired also here to reconc@@ ile tones .
&quot; from a return from a double pass , he doesn &apos;t stop anything . &quot;
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
&quot; re@@ stores , be not useful . &quot;
and with a Bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional concerns .
&quot; whether his own package is un@@ constitutional at all corners , and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partners , it is still necessary . &quot;
there is quite a lot in what war could provide .
&quot; however , the SPD is currently trying to pro@@ claim the topic of inner security . &quot;
Part@@ eich@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel appe@@ aled just a c@@ auti@@ ous conversation and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes further to the safety .
Volkswagen is still coming through .
&quot; despite the diesel prop@@ and@@ als , the supplier will increase worldwide . &quot;
but not in all markets it runs round .
&quot; in response to the call , there are hosts around a term . &quot;
&quot; in the deliveries of deliveries , Volkswagen will start into the second half of the year . &quot;
&quot; in spite of its many brands and many well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest coach can continue to show an increase in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; but in July , the nuclear brand VW looked primarily in Western Europe and raised the entire sale of sales , such as the company announced in D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; worldwide , the VW brand in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars sold 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
&quot; in the home market Germany , deliveries increased by almost a sixth . &quot;
&quot; Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann , Managing Director Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann , led the weaker numbers from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there have been in some core markets by &quot; &quot; altered economic conditions &quot; &quot; a department store . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , British vote also bur@@ dened by the EU , a spokesperson explained . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the gas aff@@ ection@@ aries first escal@@ ates first , another min@@ us also stands to book . &quot;
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; all in all , the affected house mark of the Lower Saxony is further restricted by the diesel scandal : after the first seven months , only an extradition of 0.9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles are available . &quot;
Group CEO Fred Kap@@ pler was able to advance to sales from January to July .
&quot; Volkswagen generated 1.3 percent more vehicles in this period , 5,@@ 904 million worldwide . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software program .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW calls around 2.5 million cars to re@@ armament into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of re@@ armament , VW re@@ iter@@ ated that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after changing the vehicles there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or engine power . &quot;
&quot; the coach charge the customer to the conversion a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but did not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was called on Friday in corporate management . &quot;
reason : legal host@@ esses .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reports , Volkswagen granted his German customers now a guarantee for a combined diesel models . &quot;
this was confirmed on Monday VW @-@ Represent@@ atives in the Federal Ministry of Transport on Monday .
the public ministry was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has to meet the requirements of my Commission &apos;s Commission , and the KBA must be fulfilled . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations of these are not accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has taken over the warranty , that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor performance after re@@ armament no deteri@@ or@@ ations take place , and all typical permits relevant vehicles will be unchanged . &quot;
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was in corporate circles .
&quot; with the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen sees the opportunity for example a half year after the re@@ armament of some engine damage to a workshop - and that could bring back to the new software , even if the damage can do nothing . &quot;
&quot; it is also important to avoid any damage caused by any damage caused by any damage , which means nothing to deal with the exhaust @-@ causing scandal , as it was called . &quot;
therefore VW is using the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands rich austerity as the second Institute in Germany .
&quot; ban@@ ker Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on gyp@@ ro@@ - or daily business accounts . &quot;
the Bundes@@ verband German banks speaks of a single case and does not see any signal : normal austerity must not be afraid to pay for their spar@@ row penalty .
&quot; banks money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay a 0,4 percent penalty . &quot;
&quot; this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund from September from private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily business accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost € 400 in the year , &quot; Paul said . &quot;
&quot; it has been a total of 40 million euros , that could be taken up from one day to the others , and could not able to analyze it . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and generate 0.4 per cent costs , &quot; said the ban@@ kers . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t lay down for each million 4000 Euro . &quot;
the cost is now going on after the re@@ urs@@ ing principle .
&quot; the cash simply in the t@@ res@@ s@@ ors of the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four survivors , I don &apos;t like to have the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the Bank Board . &quot;
most customers would have understanding and change on other designs .
only few emigrated to other banks .
the cooperative association Bavaria declared : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes significant costs at all banks . &quot;
&quot; they alone bear , be &quot; operating economically permanently not possible . &quot;
&quot; thus , some German banks have therefore increased their fees for Account management , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
&quot; with pen@@ alties for deposits from three million euros , the Thuring@@ ian People and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burg country made headlines in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , chief executive manager of the Bank Association , said : &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t expect private customers to pay for deposits in Germany , the competition in Germany is much too strong in Germany and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is a client which is equipped with a little more lush . &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , if it &apos;s free money . &quot;
&quot; founded in 1911 , the cooperative bank G@@ mund has two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ E@@ ager , Kre@@ m@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region . &quot;
&quot; currently there are no other banks known to the cooperative association Bavaria , &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man for deposits of private clients , &quot; speaker Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the German national banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ banks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had explained in the end of June : &quot; the threshold , to the negatives , is very high , very high . &quot;
&quot; the competition is hard , and it sho@@ res the emig@@ ration of investors to the competition . &quot;
customers in Germany will not let themselves be pleased in the width .
Dest@@ ination boards : who actually buys records ?
lon@@ ely men love medium @-@ aged plates .
&quot; before going to the comment , in order to over@@ saw him under the p@@ seudonym non @-@ aging defect @-@ aged men with r@@ ins@@ ane ins@@ ults , this statement depends on current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the revival of records are not attributable to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , who want to welcome the unity of physical objects , but to the Mid@@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently purchased a record are all the forecast for the age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely har@@ vest@@ ing group . &quot;
it is also not a hor@@ des by hob@@ by@@ ers - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers keep their feelings rather to spend ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results agree on You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on television , I would follow the camera while in the midst of a busy road in Soh@@ o , a modest ho@@ ist suit , before I keep standing , my hands hold and something determin@@ ant like : &quot; so , let &apos;s throw a little look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let &apos;s throw a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even if the heart of So@@ H@@ os is slow to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the building where once an independent seller , there is still a hand@@ ful fantastic record specialist . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the camera memory to turn the camera for the next part , in which I stand up to various men in such shops and try to appreciate their age and mind by observation . &quot;
&quot; Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I of Sister Ray ( Data Number : two young women , three men mean age ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Data Number : eight men middle age , one woman , probably around the 20 ) sequence , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
is he a collector ?
&quot; I already guess , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4.000 records . &quot;
&quot; this record plates , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I &apos;m not followed by him ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of its available income : it is now able to buy records that he could not afford to buy stuff , which he sold when he was young and ple@@ dged . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late 1960s , early 70s , which appeared , when I was 11 or 12 . things , when I was probably a little too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it is true that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend a time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot . &quot;
this is my aster .
&quot; We@@ z , 25 who works with Sister Ray , believe that many customers that he meets the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also not@@ ices a new wave of people who have influenced by the media , people who have heard about com@@ eback and to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; of the conversations that I have led , people usually have been credited to their collection in 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
that would explain the boom to the record of a certain age of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of plates ?
it takes just a few seconds in a shop such as phon@@ ica to realize that record shops offers a so@@ othing community of equ@@ in@@ ers .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers accepted the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
some plate fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to withdraw the stability of confi@@ dential record sleeves as well as happy it@@ gen@@ h@@ ings .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or property of material possessions than any kind of comfort , &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is with me as collectors and I think it is so many people .
it is a simple way to deal with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; &quot; a staff from a plate stack . &quot;
&quot; a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month , have not heard them yet . &quot;
&quot; the pol@@ l found out that 41 % have a turn@@ table that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , don &apos;t have turn@@ tables . &quot;
at this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned while I by a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova Com@@ ra@@ cer bl@@ ät@@ er .
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works with sounds of the Universe ( Data Number : three men mean age ) , has noticed a &quot; trop@@ hy &quot; of the Revi@@ val . &quot;
&quot; someone just arrived here and said , &quot; I have no turn@@ tables , but I would like to buy a radio record that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a great percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more productive , less musicians . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not elderly , which come only slowly . &quot;
&quot; F@@ opp , which has dedicated the sound plate almost a whole floor , has an under@@ lining audience when I clean . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , te@@ age@@ j@@ ure and women aged middle ages . &quot;
even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above shops - Wild Be@@ asts neu@@ ester syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zer@@ - and Ex@@ hau@@ led Pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ y@@ ans from speakers - is it good to see such di@@ vers@@ ities of the customer .
&quot; none of them looks especially lon@@ ely , but brand psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are badly det@@ ectable , if one stands next for about 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around for some minutes in the business and considers the variation of the plates for sale . &quot;
you do rather need a man@@ ne@@ ster bum@@ ble@@ bee as a big buy .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting records no real option , says it . &quot;
it costs much .
&quot; it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or any way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; &quot; they drives with a loved si@@ gh . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record owners : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I admit the licence , I watch the je@@ ans hot@@ el@@ pants , I watch a group of young teenage girls who move himself for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a Cro@@ sley turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of no@@ vels , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classi@@ cs , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody looks like it - perhaps because they are only decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to put them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that every attraction for these items can mean more money for the industry and to send some customers to the depths So@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , even the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my re@@ resear@@ ches revealed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record owners exist in reality , record shops and On@@ line@@ for@@ en . &quot;
these people are probably working hard in school or offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the bum@@ ble@@ bees by turn@@ around in the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while they master the rigid view of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator who rises over the shoulders of nothing bitter @-@ aged men . &quot;
&quot; in Greenland , Greenland is the longest living cycl@@ one - video surface . &quot;
scientific saying that Green@@ land@@ hai has the longest lif@@ esp@@ an from all verteb@@ rates on the planet .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen , the shar@@ ks studied , says that the record at a female was assumed , from which it is assumed that it is between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long . &quot;
French court re@@ jects offer about demol@@ ition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court rejected an offer of public authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais home in which thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a trial hearing these week the authorities argu@@ ed in Cal@@ ais , that the state should be forced to sell 72 pro@@ vis@@ ually business within the camp goods , from cigarettes to energy drinks , sell hair@@ dresser services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or easy meals for a few Euros in provisional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture argu@@ ed that these places should be broken down because they would represent a parallel economy , which would not be paid for a fire and san@@ ity risk . &quot;

&quot; they also led out that the temporary shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need . &quot;
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people that could operate the 72 provisional business , but admitted that the concerns of the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture are absolutely comprehen@@ sible . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
&quot; Germany &apos;s R@@ aser must be set up on the next generation of speed measurement : in various federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash units are tested to re@@ produce the temp@@ pos@@ als especially effectively . &quot;
the fut@@ ur@@ istic @-@ acting En@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden may be used for example to im@@ bur@@ sting points where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement .
&quot; for example , on highway construction or to san@@ it@@ ating bridges with temporary Tem@@ plates , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with a stationary Bl@@ itter for compliance with the speed limit . &quot;
but a prolonged mobile assembly can be too dangerous or costly .
En@@ forcement trailer is autonomous : his battery lasts five days with un@@ interrupted measuring operation five days ; the case data will be encrypted via a modem .
&quot; in addition to laser measuring technology , all vehicles can be included in multiple tracks simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; variable speed lim@@ ings , as well as trou@@ bles@@ hooting according to time , driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitor . &quot;
&quot; in the high @-@ driven condition , one can move the trailer according to manufacturers with every car with a trailer coupling . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not easy to be sto@@ wed , it is lowered to the measuring operation , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mo@@ red and by the way van@@ ish the safe outer shell . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from V@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to data from Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities are also fl@@ ashing with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 units , following an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
great Britain pick silver in the 7 @-@ er ru@@ g@@ by after Fiji has taken the Gold Class Gold .
&quot; the impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7 @-@ er ru@@ g@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening to a ru@@ sty stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were struck with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ ax Stadium in Rio . &quot;
&quot; Fiji divided a master class in the handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , back , line @-@ run and raw power to win gold - its first Olympic wa@@ ist of any colour . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was sunk by the non @-@ bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Great Britain on this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the significant defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ final on the same day could fall to them in the finals . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of this , Fiji had put a 15 @-@ man team in the best form during this form . &quot;
it could be for GB to be a sol@@ ace - but it will probably not - that at least one turns tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is chief trainer Ben Ryan , the former head for England . &quot;
GB had a difficult way behind him .
&quot; eight years ago , she lost with Ryan every game in Adelaide Sev@@ ens . &quot;
they just lost one .
&quot; the cap will hurt , but the progress is amazing . &quot;
Fiji began wonder@@ fully and left the attacks of GB@@ S from fun .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co . , when the winner of the World Series winner went up to 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au entered the corner . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes playing time , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack on the right corner from which he walked . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly made the ball .
a cas@@ ual winding of Mitchell stopped the mount of Man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal but it has just stopped .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a placed a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ stop and there was still over one minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u preached through further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK teams and stor@@ med up to line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it is so , when Fiji had been born to play the 7 , while GB still has been used . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; UK introduced basic changes to half @-@ time and completed the fi@@ ji@@ b gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fiji . &quot;
&quot; Dan N@@ orton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went long in favour of the South se@@ sul@@ ate , whose fans che@@ eks , flags tra@@ ced and d@@ anced at the grand@@ stand . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the play@@ ful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame translated the i dot @-@ dot with another attempt in the last seconds .
the P@@ fi@@ ff stalli@@ on that Fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced and GB sm@@ itten down in the lawn .
&quot; earlier on the day , Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 defe@@ ats and Britain urged South Africa into a cris@@ p match of the race - British conversion of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half after the front , but Dan N@@ orton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gateway under the post in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late tac@@ kling tac@@ kling Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , secured the gain - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning through struggle with the cancer of the trainer to the rowing victory
there will be no hiding gold than with these games and that will be what hot .
&quot; from the first rowing to the last , 220 tough H@@ ie@@ ve , who enter the history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional significance in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if there were only those who were at the Ru@@ sia , there were three voices in the boat . the ech@@ o of the train@@ ers Robin Williams , was present as they were the second Olympics in the two of the British Sports , who put on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; her domin@@ ance was absolutely , at least her 3@@ 9,@@ ter un@@ ra@@ zed use , which is also unprecedented . &quot;
what we see are two brilliant athl@@ ete who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of s@@ warf , which does not reflect the type of Tri@@ um@@ ph@@ es . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in the ru@@ dder there is a batt@@ ali@@ on to consent , which make the difference and there was no more helpful than the trainer , who was diagnosed 30 months ago when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
as he said he ris@@ ky what ris@@ ky .
&quot; I had wind cancer , which is oper@@ able , and they did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a quite aw@@ ful situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had good luck that he could start in early 2014 , out of season , which could begin the interru@@ ption of a minimum , if that is the right term in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go back soon . &quot;
it was an inc@@ entive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and running around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet on a time when they said that some steps would be enough . &quot;
that is how it begins .
&quot; the rowing is already a challenge , but that makes it even greater . &quot;
&quot; in the in@@ visibility of victory went their first thought to Williams , who spent a annoying morning with something more than anything else and tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; St@@ anning , known as captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; I was this week a emotional wreck . that &apos;s something extremely extreme but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it just repe@@ ats me how much I mean , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin we would be no one , therefore we would be a massive thanks to him . he is the best coach in the world . &quot;
I would have no better person to trainer or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with whom their opponents could not help .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; Helen called &quot; stay in the process , stay tuned in the process . &quot;
it is really important to catch up .
&quot; we had a good start and at the same time , we were not looking out to make something great . &quot;
&quot; today we wanted no fireworks today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race that we did . &quot;
the couple will take a year for a year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ stroke . &quot;
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
that would have too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic @-@ singer . &quot;
it was all so new to me and I was stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
for 31 years exempl@@ ary for clarity
&quot; the managing director of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ eine &quot; , &quot; R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring . &quot;
the association is considered &quot; Bavarian &quot; . &quot;
a small fr@@ ame@@ ful drinking water @-@ purpose unit as a model for large water manufacturers .
it was said that some time ago in the origin@@ alt@@ on in a post of Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
a little later the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia took the whole .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ one group &quot; sailed Bavaria as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who had been working for 31 years , was 28 years as managing director . &quot;
now he was reti@@ re at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose unit of the V@@ eit@@ endorf group with headquarters in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality Breit@@ brun@@ n , promotes approximately 150@@ 000 cubic metres of water per year and supplies 32 locations and ham@@ lets with approximately 5,@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; member communities are the congregations of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brun@@ n , lou@@ der , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of B@@ aun@@ ach . &quot;
there are water supply agreements for further cities and municipalities .
&quot; the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ n Civil in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , remin@@ ded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was discontinued in 1985 as a water wart and has been appointed General Manager of the Board in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; its tasks are very diverse , and they extended themselves from the water management and maintenance work on office and organizational matters , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions up to emergency commission on weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as an outstanding events , she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new Fo@@ un@@ tain ( 1994 ) , land of land in the area of the new Fo@@ un@@ tain ( 1998 ) and repar@@ ation of farmers , the reconstruction of a central computer control ( 1999 ) and the reconstruction of a central computer control ( 2004 ) . &quot;
&quot; there have been no breast@@ feeding , and I always added the innovations again , because water is de@@ bri@@ des and drinking water the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in their basis , she comm@@ ended G@@ öl@@ &apos;s faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has worked with a lot of heart bl@@ oss@@ oms for his water purpose , and he has lived with the water @-@ purpose association , when it would be its own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , as a real practition@@ er , he held the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ one group for nit@@ rat@@ sen@@ ation in front of the district Rules of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia . &quot;
he did receive a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller s@@ add@@ led the al@@ keeper Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked for 28 years with him .
he is the best water wart and he was a faithful Kn@@ appe .
&quot; together , we were an unbe@@ atable team . &quot;
&quot; as highlights from his perspective , he described the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the re@@ structure of the purpose . &quot;
&quot; however , the biggest challenge and most difficult use were the tu@@ bing at the high container near Kirch@@ lou@@ der on January 3rd . &quot;
&quot; here , at minus 17 degrees you had to work throughout the night , so the villages could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; once again , the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n could only be stopped , because one filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hose . &quot;
the management of the drinking water Association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer , who will follow the following Ru@@ pert G@@ öller . &quot;
&quot; the soprano Anna Net@@ re@@ b@@ ko goes openly with aut@@ ism of her son Ti@@ ago , and turns out to other affected parents : &quot; you have to have courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; the medicine has made great progress , &quot; &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot;
&quot; when the disease had been recognized by her son , she had believed to die . &quot;
&quot; now , the eight year old Ti@@ ago has arrived well and is now privately in New York , where it is the best therap@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; to give an example : if I ask him something for two years , when I sang along the Milan &apos;s Milan , he remembers nothing , &quot; &quot; said Net@@ re@@ b@@ ko . &quot;
but he is the most happy man on the earth .
Ti@@ ago comes from Net@@ re@@ b@@ k@@ os connection with the bass bar@@ itone Er@@ win Sch@@ rott .

relationship in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - Man shoot at a partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man attacked his partner in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 a.m. and wounded them .
&quot; the man called himself with us and indicated his lifetime companion , &quot; said a police officer . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rators will be , after him , shall be publicly inv@@ oked . &quot;
&quot; now , nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the way by car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ burned and has a gl@@ at@@ ze . &quot;
meanwhile the police have released a photo of him .
&quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot;
meanwhile the man carries a gl@@ at@@ ze .
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could carry the weapon with themselves , so the police . &quot;
&quot; he who sees Sven S. , should call the 110 . &quot;
the police speaks of an &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rators in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; the competent police in Lübeck did not want to do any information about the co @-@ crossing or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but confirmed that a man had been killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a scor@@ ching off@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; said a police officer in Lu@@ beck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , there was a special alert ( SEK ) at the site of crime . &quot;
steel - light view for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ exploited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains sp@@ ared from additional costs in millions of millions .
&quot; financial bur@@ dens , which threatened the industry from its green electricity support , are of the table . &quot;
&quot; the liberation of the Renewable Energy Agency ( SPD ) in the German steel industry , the Federal Minister , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , said the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Friday edition ) . &quot;
I &apos;m really glad that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years .
&quot; according to the European Commission , the European Commission had first planned to use steel manufacturers to use gases from the high @-@ oven generation for their own consumption . &quot;
the steel industry was threatened with additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year according to the German industry .
Gabriel said the W@@ AZ , there is now a basic certificate with the EU Commission on talks with competitive edge Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only if the generators in the steel works are replaced , an EEG conversion rate of 20 percent fall . &quot;
but this also won &apos;t be collected in the steel industry .
IG Metall had the agreement of Germany &apos;s agreement with the EU Commission to qualify .
&quot; with this , the status quo will largely be established . &quot;
the successful efforts have a special meaning of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel is the future &apos; , it is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others must follow . &quot;
IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt also stated with the reform of the emission standard rules .
&quot; since the financial crisis of 2008 , the steel industry has been suffering under excessive capacity and substantial price pressure since the financial crisis of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; last year , the situation intensi@@ fied further than the world &apos;s largest producer of China , in view of the fain@@ ting domestic demand for steel in the world market . &quot;
European Manufac@@ turers take advantage of Chinese ste@@ el@@ ties price d@@ umping .
&quot; during this spring , the situation has relaxed . &quot;
&quot; for one show a cat@@ astrop@@ hic oil on imported effect , for others , the economic outlook in China have grown up . &quot;
&quot; un@@ clear , how sustainable the price of recovery is un@@ clear . &quot;
the German industry pri@@ m Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp remained c@@ auti@@ ous on Thursday .
&quot; last , the prices had rather stag@@ n@@ ated . &quot;
the sector respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp recently wanted to exclu@@ de closures of individual works .
&quot; at the end of 2015 , some 8@@ 6000 people were employed in the German steel industry . &quot;
&quot; in July , German steel producers remain careful , despite increasing prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tons , you produced just six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s figure , as the steel Society of Steel on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the quantity now returned to the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production is by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association expects an increasing force in the coming months thanks to an improved order . &quot;
&quot; community , Spirit , Health : sing Senior Citi@@ zens &quot;
&quot; Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the teaching staff she took the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sing in an elderly choir . &quot;
&quot; sing me - emotional and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , joyful and a total of living , says she . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , she does something good for her health and spirit . &quot;
&quot; for S@@ ingen is like a great hobby for seniors , Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler says of the German senior League . &quot;
&quot; most senior citizens sing in the choir and share the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
through the regular meeting you can connect social contacts and maintain social contacts .
&quot; for frequently , social and family structures often dissolve , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; to discuss and organise themselves to the others , and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of se . &quot;
&quot; in the positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler believes . &quot;
&quot; because , senior citizens train a deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
&quot; he who calls his lungs regularly , also not so fast in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; even though it comes to get the sound of the voice at age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; for older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the German labor community of the senior citizens . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , the joint singing was worth a much higher job , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure , explains them . &quot;
L@@ enz often observed that singing or hearing of songs are often w@@ akes up with older people many memories often associated with positive feelings of their youth time .
&quot; through Lie@@ d@@ tex@@ te and particularly melo@@ dies , people themselves dem@@ ise themselves for long @-@ lying events . &quot;
&quot; when singing the head , a special achievement is required , L@@ enz explained . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , focusing on their own voice and to focus on a specified rhythm , and to watch the other hat@@ ers - this is a major cogn@@ itive challenge . &quot;
&quot; just older people living alone , do not only pract@@ ise themselves on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition , which one finds through the singing in chor@@ us , H@@ ac@@ kler writes . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em is also growing by singing in the choir .
&quot; to show yourself : if I do long for something , I will get better and alert about me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start with singing , there &apos;s enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he believes not to have little talent . &quot;
&quot; they are not singing alone - with 50 sin@@ ful people , who sounds there if there is a tone beside it ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the appropriate offer , seniors are different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; someone sings among the acquain@@ tan@@ ces in an elderly , one can easily connect . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views over cho@@ irs in the surroundings .
&quot; who would like to sing in a church choir , can turn directly to the church or the church . &quot;
many senior citizens can also be found via the Internet .
&quot; anyone who has no access to the Internet , can ask the family , friends or neighbours with the help of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; those who want to sing too , should be connected to a choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
sing the soul well and has something positive - this is true for every age .
cats react sensiti@@ vely as a tom@@ cat on scre@@ ams of the Jung@@ le
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover what effect the rest of cat bab@@ ys on adult animals .
&quot; at their surprise , the male suffered not cold - but they beha@@ ved in the difference to the females always . &quot;
female cats may recognize the efficiency of cat bab@@ ys on the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
&quot; they react by ten percent faster to Lau@@ te of K@@ itt@@ ens , which are in great distress , like scientists from the veter@@ inary University and the Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
the hang@@ over also respond to the k@@ itt@@ ens - but always equal .
&quot; evi@@ dently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ stru@@ ctions of less and severely damaged young for the males either non @-@ perc@@ ei@@ vable or not of importance , &quot; &quot; said the Biolog@@ in Wie@@ b@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot;
she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous study , the research team had already discovered that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens of the k@@ itt@@ ens with the dr@@ ink@@ ness of their hel@@ fe@@ asts . &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight put@@ ts were observed from the animal conservation of MH@@ H .
&quot; they were played by little ones for three minutes , taken out of the Wur@@ f@@ box for three minutes , and were separated by mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; to the other , they were confron@@ ted with scre@@ ams of stronger her@@ b@@ ted bi@@ b that were raised in addition . &quot;
the researchers keep their results in spite of the low sample for sa@@ wing .
&quot; all females , even those who had no own offspring , acted differenti@@ ated on the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they rot@@ ten faster to the loud@@ speaker when this ru@@ fe played the very rainy k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may be born or developed with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males had ever re@@ acted , &quot; &quot; said the Biolog@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men on baby sounds . &quot;
&quot; some studies also showed that women re@@ acted into infants , whether they were already pregnant or not , the Biolog@@ o Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski spreads with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r is a football @-@ legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r . &quot;
he is accused of being a terrorist group .
an important football match for the first time after the coup attempt in Turkey .
before the du@@ el of the Erz@@ rival between Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ phin Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
&quot; even in the case of acceptance at the crash attempt in July , the government , which should not be imp@@ acted by norm@@ ality of norm@@ aries in July . &quot;
&quot; but this does not apply to those who are suspected of having suspected of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len movement , which is responsible for the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; in this context , football is not just made . &quot;
the prosecutor &apos;s office issued an arrest warrant against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r .
&quot; accordingly , South Caucas@@ ia is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ kü@@ r is supposed to be supporters of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
&quot; although the acceptance period is valid for 90 days , even until October , the life of the most Turks , however , did not have any impact on the life of the most Turks . &quot;
the no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; on public places in the whole country has been declared closed on Wednesday .
sport is - like all the country - divided into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
particularly fans of the workers &quot; clubs Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as are traditionally not counted to the friends of the President .
&quot; but what &apos;s the Gro@@ s of the Turks , however , cri@@ es in the history of dramatic experiences , is the strict re@@ jection of military p@@ ushing . &quot;
even the fans themselves agree - no matter whether their heart beat for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as .
&quot; at Titan Poker &apos;s winner , &quot; Gala &quot; will come back to Luke Po@@ dol@@ sky . &quot;
&quot; for its sporty value , the Kölner Show in the past season - with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first time as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association . &quot;
in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he achieved 1 : 0 victory .
the newspaper &quot; fan@@ atics &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in place . &quot;
he completed the season in excellent way and secured the trop@@ hy in his team .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ appointing season for the record champion had a reconc@@ ile degree . &quot;
&quot; after the pre @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; Lion &quot; is also going early in the Europe League early . &quot;
&quot; in the South of Li@@ g , it was only enough to rank six . &quot;
the season was not good .
Pok@@ al was the only way to win something .
&quot; we made it and that is the most important , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; for Master Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as , the game year ran better . &quot;
&quot; most of all , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who completed a 26 season season with 26 seasonal cuisine as the Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ tor@@ ped@@ agog@@ y the basis for the 14th title . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year old .
&quot; in this case , the AC Florence was announced with the contract and to rent Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as only borro@@ wed Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt , not to return because of the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ vacation . &quot;
&quot; if Mario would like to come to us , he just has to say it , &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; Club chief F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; however , the storms would have to be prepared to aband@@ on some one @-@ third of its worth 7.5 million euros of estimated annual salary , Or@@ man said : &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot;
&quot; despite d@@ oping : these athletes still have medals opportunities in Rio , Rio &quot;
the 34 @-@ year old Justin Gat@@ lin was already closed twice because of d@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers in Julia Step@@ ano@@ wa must not start in Rio .
others over@@ took athle@@ tics @-@ sin@@ ner can only laugh at them - they fight in Rio by medals .
the theme D@@ oping just determined the headlines from the Rio Olympics Games .
&quot; the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ o@@ wa , who had compl@@ ained after a D@@ oping sper@@ re , had failed their starting point in front of the games , was p@@ aired with her start ( 100 meters of chest ) . &quot;
&quot; it was a quir@@ ky scene : with a set smile , she was still proud in the hall and prov@@ oked with their appearance . &quot;
&quot; as determined , they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out in a J@@ ub@@ el@@ storm . &quot;
&quot; however , there are numerous other sport@@ s@@ men who continue to start in Rio Olympics despite d@@ oping past . &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 year old belongs to the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was imprisoned for two times ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; the Olympic champion in 2004 and ex @-@ world champion has been running even faster than before , it is more than 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds , the number one in the world and is considered to be the greatest ch@@ allen@@ ger from Us@@ ain Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after taking the pain of pain by oxy@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after an operation , she had severe dental pain@@ s , defended his 29 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : 2011 World Champion of 2012 and European Championship in 2011 and European Championship was positive on the prohibited stimul@@ ant @-@ mean meth@@ yl hex@@ an@@ amine for 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic denied the benefits and was closed for six months .
the four widespread thro@@ ws this year will go to the account of great gold fav@@ ours .
&quot; La@@ Shawn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion has been more than 400 m , was tested positive and 21 months in 2010 . &quot;
a means to increase penis enlargement would have been responsible .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the world &apos;s fastest man .
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ d , Belarus ) : hardly an athl@@ ete were subsequently recognized as many medals . &quot;
&quot; so T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title in 2005 , nine years later , after him was diagnosed with testosterone d@@ oping . &quot;
the meanwhile 40 @-@ year old also had to leave Olympic Silver in 2004 for ster@@ oid @-@ d@@ op@@ ings and the EM @-@ title 2006 due to testosterone abuse .
he was also recognised Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ aille to the 2008 Olympic Games due to an judgment to the International Sports Court of Justice CA@@ S .
&quot; at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m , he is located at rank two of the World Ran@@ kings . &quot;
&quot; Liu Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record and gold fav@@ ored has been positively tested in May , but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , critics were found on taking a forbidden supplements , the lock of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ dly and ran out on July 13 . &quot;
bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian viol@@ ated - multiple dead
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is standing in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ öll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; they suffered inter@@ sec@@ ts and had been treated in the hospital , but have already left this again . &quot;
she planned her hom@@ ebo@@ und in early September .
&quot; whether from another explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ uk@@ et , as well as in the southern towns of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on are also concerned Austrian citizens , was not yet un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in this regard is in continuous contact with local authorities , so snap@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; at approximately 200 kilometres south of the city of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in were initially explo@@ ded on Thursday night in an exit of two bombs . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Thai and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Netherlands and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , two war@@ nings again went up , but according to the authorities , another human being killed . &quot;
&quot; also from Ph@@ uk@@ et , a bomb explo@@ de was reported in the morning . &quot;
during the Det@@ onation of the popular swimming @-@ stran@@ ds Pat@@ ong the det@@ onation was injured as a taxi driver .
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed an urban staff . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , explo@@ it was gone by the authorities in a vase in front of the territory of the territory . &quot;
&quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations were called in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on at the south @-@ east coast . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called . &quot;
&quot; the bomb attacks have the same manuscript , &quot; said army @-@ eral Dan@@ ai de meth@@ av@@ ee Friday night before journalists . &quot;
&quot; we assume , that it is a coordinated attack . &quot;
&quot; it was too early to express themselves to possible moti@@ ves , but probably do the action of Muslim rebels . &quot;
&quot; the Thai media also wanted to recognize the samples , which is typical for the bombing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Thai police , however , declared that the attacks are not in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement of terrorism or by international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local Sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot;
rather you assume that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid .
&quot; in the past few days , the authorities have received secrets to the upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they don &apos;t have been informed of the exact time and places . &quot;
even be un@@ clear what group behind the attacks .
&quot; the police rejected their officials from the whole country to enhance security for major government buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment venues . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are always smaller bomb attacks , but they usually do not judge against tourists . &quot;
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace built over the years from Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; following reason of reason , the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends to participate in his homepage , the instructions of Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( safety level 3 ) sailed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ ar and its surroundings . &quot;
&quot; according to disp@@ utes between security forces and Muslim populations , not necessary travels across these provinces . &quot;
increased safety risk ( safety level 2 ) sailed for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were a few days after a controversial referendum on a military jun@@ ta .
this dream is also a major influence in the coming years .
&quot; Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ CH@@ A said that bombs have been an attempt to sti@@ ve chaos , while the country went towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military jun@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody crimes , holds good to have the kingdom again to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , it has not been able to manage the military in the extreme south of the country since years in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
almost one year ago in Bangkok with a attack on a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack in the country &apos;s younger history .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is in the visor of the Federal Office for constitutional protection .
&quot; according to several regional offices , the Constitutional Treaty also have made the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; in the &apos; Ident@@ ity Movement &apos; , we see the Federal President Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , migrants are diff@@ am@@ elled by Islamic belie@@ fs or from the Middle East in extrem@@ ist manner . &quot;
therefore we observe the movement as well .
&quot; the &quot; Ident@@ ity movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has also been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; she turns against &quot; &quot; Multi@@ cult @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration , &quot; and loss of their own identity . &quot;
&quot; constitu@@ ents in nine states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thüringen - observe the &quot; Ident@@ ities &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , his authority is close closely with the authorities in the decision . &quot;
&quot; groups like the &apos; ident@@ ities movement &apos; attempt to pick up their target audience , where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; generally , extre@@ mi@@ sts attempt to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the perpet@@ rated Islam@@ ists as well as right wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
that is not an advert@@ ised advertisement for your own thing .
propaganda must talk emot@@ ionally .
young people are due in a special way .
that is dangerous .
recently it was given by several federal states on contacts of &quot; identity &quot; to Af@@ D politicians .
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , I have no knowledge . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , this species can only be relevant to some point . &quot;
&quot; it comes to whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - through certain people , the extrem@@ ist , changes its target and so extreme . &quot;
so there is crucial for those people to control the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
&quot; with a look at the significant increase of legal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugees , Ma@@ as said he would not speak of new rights in this context . &quot;
but we have found in the past years that there may be a state @-@ terrorism structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Freit@@ aler group .
&quot; it can be well , that more rectangular group@@ ings or small groups constitute the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee @-@ speaking or attacks from other right @-@ wing moti@@ fs . &quot;
but it is not recogni@@ zable in Germany or across Europe @-@ wide control of sp@@ iny .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or social networks .
&quot; furthermore , Ma@@ ate concerned about that many survivors on the account of people went that had not previously appeared in the right scene before that . &quot;
this is the wor@@ r@@ ying .
&quot; many of the susp@@ ects at attacks on asylum were not known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed any criminal off@@ ences that were previously agreed with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts that were perhaps politically in@@ different or for example CDU , SPD or Left , who then have been radic@@ alised by far @-@ right mood . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is used for Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympic risks or world records at the Olympic Games .
this shows the brave performance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the easily over@@ looked s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly that he couldn &apos;t see any more in the TV screen . &quot;
he just disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was chosen .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ ré was subsequently used to become the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished with a return of 48 seconds and took the 59@@ th place of 59 starters . &quot;
&quot; however , it was rather his not the sporty figure that attracted the attention of international media . &quot;
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old is taking part in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ians got a special start from the international swimming pool .
this is distributed to swim in under@@ presented countries .
&quot; since in Equ@@ op@@ ia , most athletes run , Hab@@ te wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ name did the round .
some media reported him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; the English tab@@ loid The Sun &quot; made him fun with &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; on him . &quot;
&quot; his time , he only struck down a minute and almost five seconds on the 100 meters of Fre@@ estyle , there was no part . &quot;
compare with &quot; Eric the E@@ EL &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run of Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i took care for media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a pre@@ run over 100 meters of Fre@@ estyle alone . &quot;
Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i was fired at the time of fr@@ en@@ etic .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old studied only eight months before Olympia and had never completed a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump sees the threatening election situation not so tight
Republi@@ can Presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks on a election campaign in Florida .
&quot; if you have nothing to do with the U.S. president , Donald Tr@@ ump is already an alternative video . &quot;
then he then asc@@ ends into the holiday .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential election in November , it would be either fl@@ aps , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; &quot; said the candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in an interview with the U.S. television station CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it is not rich for him on the grounds of political correc@@ t@@ ness , this is fine , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; thus he described US President Barack Obama and the Can@@ didate of Democrats , Hillary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; in his party , more and more resistance formed . &quot;

Gf@@ K leadership occurs after dis@@ appointing business
the consumer research company Gf@@ K do@@ ves his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the back@@ rest suddenly came suddenly - but not surprisingly surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K had learned that the chair of Chief Executive Officer Matthias Hart@@ mann is all un@@ safer to stay longer the success of his achievements .
turbul@@ ence on the top of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : once again dis@@ appointing business figures and the resignation of business management is the global number five in the industry in front of a person@@ ell new beginning .
Gf@@ K @-@ Executive chief wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
&quot; the chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Council , Ar@@ no grinding , has already been separated from the Supervisory Board with effect as of September 12 . &quot;
&quot; as of September 1 , the executive board of the Executive Board , Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , handed over the leadership of the Executive Board . &quot;
&quot; he is supposed to take over the function of a &quot; Executive Officer , &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found . &quot;
the company called &quot; different views &quot; for long @-@ term corporate alignment .
details wanted to call a corporate speaker on Friday .
&quot; who will be taking the market research company in future , is currently un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; in announ@@ cements , it was called on Friday , at the shareholders &apos; decision , the dis@@ appointment of the further lasting successes of years ago led to a structural reform . &quot;
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been on the Gf@@ K top since 2011 .
&quot; but the fruits of the restructuring , however , are not to be seen after 5 years . &quot;
&quot; given the last bad Gf@@ K business , each par@@ tak@@ ers will eventually be un@@ quiet sometime . &quot;
&quot; if that would be the case with BMW , that would be the case that the qu@@ and@@ ts would do so . &quot;
&quot; following set@@ backs in the preceding quarter of 2016 , the company had not able to stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales rose by 6.1 percent below the previous year &apos;s level . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the first half @-@ year , sales revenues amounted to 72@@ 1.2 million euros by 3.4 per cent . &quot;
&quot; in view of its difficult economic situation , the profit in the second quarter is due mainly due to its difficult economic situation . &quot;
&quot; in the Consumer Experience Business Experience , the Group posted a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million under the stake of the Group . &quot;
&quot; in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K had a net income of 19.@@ 7 million . &quot;
accidents - bus slide in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ash@@ n in dit@@ ch : eight Ver@@ sat@@ in
&quot; during an accident of a travel agent with 43 senior citizens , on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ n ( County Aur@@ ich ) eight people have been injured . &quot;
&quot; two occup@@ ants suffered heavy injuries , divided the police . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old chassis of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to sof@@ ten its data according to an opposite le@@ aster , partly on the counter road . &quot;
&quot; the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , such as an spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund . &quot;
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the persons could not leave the bus , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six lif@@ ebo@@ ards and a ambul@@ ance came to the accident at the state road 2 .
the most recent travelers were brought back by a liner bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ oh@@ ner district in Pe@@ ws@@ um .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
investig@@ ators demanded the load driver and possible witnesses to sign up in the police .
&quot; fees per cubic meters are from 1 October 2016 for the area of the se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 18 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wage fee will be increased by then , when appropriate measures are required . &quot;
&quot; after a heavy calculation , the se@@ wage price in Az@@ endorf is equivalent to 4,@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ houses ( CS@@ U ) reported , was noted in the approval of the budget by the country to Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these san@@ itation facilities . &quot;
&quot; due to legal foundations , the Cas@@ endorf market is required to provide a cost @-@ covering facilities . &quot;
&quot; as of 1 October 2016 , citizens and commercial transmission from the world trade , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg , and Z@@ ult@@ enberg need to attack deeper into the pur@@ se . &quot;
the fees are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Chairman of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt , a new cal@@ am@@ ulation of the fees for the san@@ itation of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ covers from the previous calculations of the previous period . &quot;
&quot; with all three se@@ wer increases , Schmidt founded a relatively small se@@ wage plant with a very small se@@ wage plant , which is between 6@@ 800 and 12000 cubic metres per year . &quot;
&quot; due to its low distribution basis , for example , expenses for many thousands of Euros would be engraved . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the se@@ wage plant will be slightly decl@@ ining in all three systems . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , during all three plants in all three plants have not been noticed in a substantial extent because of its ages of rehabilitation and repair expend@@ itu@@ res . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for cat@@ fish , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that in the water se@@ wer Az@@ endorf had to be replaced by a mechanical ventilation system due to a damage change .
&quot; in the pump of space , the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old convey@@ ing systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and used for nearly 20 years of operation of the first sep@@ tic tank , se@@ wage se@@ wage s@@ lu@@ dge and allow an additional ventilation option to allow the water legal regulations as well . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; for this extraordinary expend@@ itu@@ res , the continued cleaning and maintenance costs came to take into account in the new calculations period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which at the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 still clearly below the current level . &quot;
stone houses made clear that at low se@@ wage in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance . &quot;
&quot; in this case , Schmidt , the market community of large maintenance costs in the se@@ wage plant has remained in the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned systems will continue to be pre@@ dict@@ ated , especially since one could not extend the supply area of the se@@ wer @-@ purpose of Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ oc@@ al in order to be extended by these plants , because it concerns de@@ miner@@ alization facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria posted for the first time in 8 months of inflation
&quot; National statistics show that inflation was in July 1 % , on a monthly basis . &quot;
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first of zero has been posted since October of last year than positive 0.2 % .
the annual average growth of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation amounted to -@@ 0.2 % in July 2016 .
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1,2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the prices fell by clothes and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; Mobi@@ liar , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as at the mon@@ day of alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education remain unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; anim@@ e &quot; effect as Asian caric@@ ature critic@@ ises
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter anim@@ e is inspired , but some ob@@ servers say it is uns@@ en@@ si@@ bel to races . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool , snap@@ chat allows you to change about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with ident@@ ities in such a way that borders even to Ab@@ sur@@ de . &quot;
you can transform yourself into an pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are dis@@ concer@@ ted , independent tools , which generate more than 30 million suffer@@ ers per day . &quot;
all patches with flaws arrive to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have drawn in the past criticism in which they were accused of prop@@ agate the app Black@@ face @-@ coat or white skin as a beauty deal .
&quot; when this week some users found a filter , who gave them sl@@ ot@@ ting , false teeth and war@@ d@@ ded che@@ eks , they called some critics a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow light . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they asked whether these repeated contro@@ versy were asked to claim a larger problem , that the company has di@@ vers@@ ities . &quot;
&quot; the news and the indig@@ nation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat announced that it had de@@ activated the feature . &quot;
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was intended to pay homage to anim@@ e characters and not as cartoon by Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but external , the r@@ att@@ les experienced r@@ att@@ us , remin@@ ded the filter of infr@@ inging c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
other loan had chosen the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail wrote Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ eter has been widespread over the photos that the filter &quot; hurt and mil@@ dly was un@@ pleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the counter@@ position of a very conflic@@ ting Asian caric@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not joint @-@ sufficient but that the yellow layer was pulled into the outlet extre@@ m .
snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diet and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all keep in the hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who di@@ vers@@ ed in the race as their older players - could rather be expected to be expected .
&quot; if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats felt a picture , it is much more difficult for a user to remain un@@ noticed , when it was the case earlier , the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu said in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu decided that you work as a product manager and engineering for medium to er@@ ase your Snap@@ chat account , asked others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that she might believe that racial @-@ related contro@@ versy would also reflect a lack of di@@ vers@@ ity with the objec@@ tivity in snap@@ shots . &quot;
Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the most important part white ; male leadership and ended up with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either you have no representation of people with other skin colors in their staff , so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions that they may be safe or comfortable to tell what about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat largely un@@ answered . &quot;
the company hasn &apos;t added any figures for the failure of its workforce and points to its status as private companies .
&quot; on Thursday , Snap@@ chat turned to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his staff , but according to a speaker , the company recently compet@@ ed a personnel responsible that focuses on an under@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu said that she will leave her Snap@@ chat account , and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users as we need to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
&quot; military leadership for@@ ged ISIS intelligence service , represents Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; according to the United States Central Command , military commission @-@ related information to draw an optimi@@ stic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it permits the actual conditions of Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the provisional report , created by an Task Force of the republi@@ can members of the Armed Forces Committee , reported by great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command intelligence services , reported how superior their ass@@ ess@@ ments in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , shortly C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; news service information , which were typically embroi@@ dered by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ part@@ ments , regularly allowed a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism than it had allowed the actual states of other news services , cited a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what has happened at Cent@@ Com , is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers are suffering when bad analyses will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert appointed republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the leadership errors in Cent@@ Com are enough to top the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there are no direct advis@@ able to modify the government records under Obama instructions , it shows how analysts saw the pressure of their fore@@ heads , a optimi@@ stic picture of the threat of Islamic State , also known as ISIS or Isi@@ l . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , comments and statements were clearly more positive before the congress , presented the report . &quot;
&quot; for example , Cent@@ Com was publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ ul , the second largest city of Iraq , remains under control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , it is much clear . &quot; &quot; Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , republi@@ can convention par@@ liam@@ ents from Kansas , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the mid @-@ year 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the peak of Central Command changes the temporary staff reports to play down ISIS to ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans call the Task Force in life after them was added to their concerns about the mani@@ pulation of reports to the Islamic State .
&quot; the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings , during the investigations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the general manager of the Ministry of Defense . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the republi@@ can Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 Cent@@ Com created a comprehensive process for the creation of retro@@ active en@@ forcement ass@@ ess@@ ments to Isi@@ l and Iraqi Security services , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. ship , announced in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , as Mr. Schiff , had delayed the release of retro@@ actively report@@ age , &quot; did the mor@@ ale under analysts and &quot; gave a very little space for devi@@ ating opinions . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. Schiff and Democrats gave up no evidence on a intervention of the White House in Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , regarding a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times investig@@ ates investigations into the Pentagon &apos;s general inspec@@ torate , which were recorded according to complaints from Cent@@ Com analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press pre@@ sidents of the Pentagon , announced in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress during the investigation of the General Inspec@@ tion to be underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have experienced opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the Ministry of Intelligence and the Defence Ministry welcome an controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
&quot; the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions about the question of a successful air campaign against American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an alleg@@ ation , which is now taken by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the accus@@ ations of last year , however , stated that President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest ass@@ ess@@ ments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the obe@@ dience information about the Islamic State , more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a signature of many analysts predi@@ cting only a small cre@@ denti@@ als in Iraq and had a little time to make sure about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in Revolt against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ kers following the government statement that contrary to the testimony of the government &apos;s government , there was no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group because these pro@@ vis@@ ually refin@@ eries were commissioned to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this realization was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ aging commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , has been critic@@ ised by members of the legisl@@ ature because of its excessive positive assessment of the war on a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
General Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the US winning four @-@ fourth match in the field @-@ hockey women , a show@@ down with great Britain before &quot;
&quot; one day after winning three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am made the first two goals for the American Feld@@ ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I do not belong to the people who keep their goals in mind .
&quot; however she knows : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition , and in their group with the British on the first place to remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will match the first round on Saturday in the last round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which the two teams will reach the first and second place within six teams . &quot;
the first place is going to take a little longer out of the way to run the other group .
&quot; as always the game is going out on Saturday , the Americans have caused a surprising run@@ e by their success story , four years after they landed at the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania while the first time with three years she played a Ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ ra@@ cket in her hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became a National player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
they missed the Olympics in 2008 because they could not qualify for the Ka@@ der .
then the year 2012 was in which her team went wrong for her and her team .
&quot; in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham became an Engl@@ ish@@ man , a coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things better . &quot;
&quot; a culture change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work experience in London that we now have .
we have the ru@@ dder around .
&quot; on Thursday night , B@@ am opened the door@@ step in the first half of the game with a retreat from the se@@ am area . &quot;
&quot; India had gone to the game without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the play of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she finished a Sprint with the flat ball on the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and lu@@ te the ball into the gate around the Americans to obtain a 2 @-@ 0 leadership . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gateway in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on Saturday from the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , too late it is , the Olympic Games are . &quot;
&quot; the Rio de Janeiro , the events in Rio de Janeiro will feel continually and inev@@ itable , a race relay between competition and stre@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; it is , as the Olympic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning rod , who will protect from the bracelets for the s@@ wimm@@ ers on the tri@@ mmer . &quot;
&quot; you can not listen to the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s waiting long in the coff@@ es@@ hop , without using Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ cover@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there are Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women of women with dimples , would have been fully submitted to this known name that would be sent to Prime Time , when he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even F@@ real . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines . &quot;
the Olympic flame is not illuminated every event .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shadow , sports that are not generally accepted : air guns , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast swimming and may reign too long .
&quot; but if I have modest arguments on my specific favor@@ ites , then let me get attention to the discre@@ et charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines have already been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it was the last 16 years that many people knew that I didn &apos;t know that there is a Olympic port@@ able at all . &quot;
that could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes to match , it never won a medal in the tramp@@ ol@@ ine jump and had an athl@@ ete until 2012 , who made it to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans to share for women .
&quot; for Dong Dong , Dong Dong , China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal in London this year . &quot;
&quot; the trampoline jumping has a certain outer fish , partly because it sounds for the un@@ enlighten@@ ed ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school as those that sounds for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I &apos;m not an expert , but only a happy enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
it has hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never to end - but also the gra@@ zie of the gym and diving that combines two sports that are essentially united .
&quot; the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means something like &quot; jumping board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; jumping winners jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and must have a number of falling movements ( turning , real and salad ) before they land at the feet . &quot;
&quot; they are rated according to the official Olympic program , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio . &quot;
the common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts hop@@ ed in their quest for gold , faster , up and down , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes go back , down and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but also in the television transmission another higher target : the world or the Olympic @-@ ords . &quot;
&quot; the targeted Stre@@ ets is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to stir even a viewer &apos;s tears . &quot;
but it is also what I even feel when watching this games as a somewhat tired .
the trampoline offers a atrop@@ ause .
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ spr@@ inger is above .
a down@@ ward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she pr@@ un@@ ed , seem@@ ingly heavier like an ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes to the top , then down again , then effort@@ lessly . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty but during the practice there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wolves enter into the distance , only the toler@@ um@@ er@@ ical , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympic Games .
&quot; the qualification and final hours of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also around 13.00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will run the final count as part of an afternoon block of two days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one who probably will probably see in general mo@@ il . &quot;
&quot; when the awareness of consciousness is only reached by the att@@ acker and objec@@ ti@@ fication of male athletes , as it was the male US @-@ Turner at The Wall Street Journal , then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits its air @-@ rin@@ d , new fan base . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested in Ethiopia , Long a ally of the United States &quot;
violent protest in Ethiopia
&quot; protest@@ ers , who demand political changes in Ethiopia , strug@@ gled in violent resistance . &quot;
witnesses say that they were killed by protests during cl@@ ashes with police .
Ethiopia has just been working together ?
&quot; over the last ten years , it was one of the most stable in Africa , a solid consortium of Western Europe with a fast @-@ growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in the past few months , protests against the government strug@@ gled against the country , reaching out more areas . &quot;
last week thousands of people stor@@ med down the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the response of the government was un@@ merciful according to human rights organisations .
witnesses said that polic@@ emen were shot un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators and killed armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; in circulation videos on protests , which are probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security professionals are fighting with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand against a wall . &quot;
the chief of the UN authority for human rights demands an ongoing investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to cooperate with this country and will even become more difficult , &quot; &quot; Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated from the west .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror over the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , especially in Somalia . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian economy expanded in considerable temp@@ o .
its infrastructure has dra@@ stically improved - there is a new P@@ end@@ anger train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
&quot; roads are generally quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was everything else as an example for democracy - human rights organisations have continued the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , whereby dis@@ sidents were effective for silence . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile , or put into prison , or cast into the desert of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and don &apos;t have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; said Sey@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous problems that cover everything from the land use to worms in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a widespread election last year , the ruling party and its allies gain the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , st@@ resses along the border with Erit@@ rea ; a battle for this z@@ ack@@ y , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front , or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , who were more or less forced to share the turbul@@ ence and could be armed . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of de@@ bit@@ ing after years ago are explo@@ ding in the surface under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smart phones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , since cheap smartphones were increasingly more frequent and improved by Internet services . &quot;
&quot; even if the government does access to Facebook and Twitter what they are in regular intervals , especially at protests , so many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies , which hide it , wherever they stop . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians said they were gathered to protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two biggest eth@@ nic@@ ities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since Ä@@ ons prosp@@ ered the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ae@@ oli@@ an mainly Christian high@@ lands , in politics and economy , while they are the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are living and live in flat areas . &quot;
but this is also changing .
&quot; we are going to coordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot;
the largest protests took place in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominant un@@ fair by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military service in the trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was until his death in an un@@ poll@@ uted disease in the year 2012 , 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was considered tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was particularly am@@ used to perceive early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and special contra@@ ctors to edit opponents and to make them harmful .
&quot; the current regime is lacking in this fundamental skill , &quot; Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen from relatively un@@ attended reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiop@@ ian Mountains , comes from H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am from the South . &quot;
analysts say that he enjoys not the confidence of the security services provided by the Tig@@ ray .
many feared that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia had such an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , according to analysts , apparently by the government , they were apparently stolen by the government . &quot;
&quot; during the following Raz@@ icia , many protest@@ ers were killed , even if it were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts deri@@ ded Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , as well as the new P@@ end@@ anger , as well as its measur@@ able progress in poverty control . &quot;
but apparently this is not the intention of intensi@@ fication of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month &apos;s protest@@ ers in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ic city , by Tig@@ ray run business and hatred toward the Tig@@ ray is increasingly used in the social media . &quot;
analysts say that protests in the United States and other Western allies bring into an independent position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ during over the neighboring Somalia , even if they recently announced that she has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want to crum@@ ble its ally in a already volatile area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin free migration . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his asser@@ tion Obama called ISIS was &quot; Sar@@ kas@@ mus &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last contro@@ versy on Friday that his campaign claims that his multi @-@ repeated claim , President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder of the terrorist group of Islamic State . &quot; &quot;
this clari@@ fication fell on new questions about the Presidential candidate of the Presidential candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans if he was able to communicate and understand@@ able with the American public .
&quot; it also brings his fel@@ low@@ soldier , who stri@@ ve to take him during an event@@ ful phase of protection , to explain in the pec@@ uli@@ ar position , which he could not have meant . &quot;
&quot; after he had made the suggest@@ ion at a campaign event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump on Wednesday had rest@@ rained and insi@@ sted on interviews that he really did not intend to signi@@ fy the President and Mrs. Clinton . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning , Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day , Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation completely seriously . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to help the statement something weak@@ ened by remin@@ ded him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the republi@@ can Presidential candidate does not want to know about it . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of cr@@ iti@@ que came down to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tries to draw the focus of its campaign because of falling conversion to economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held speech@@ es to the economic situation in Michigan this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump was trying to return to this subject again . &quot;
on Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals will lead to higher taxes and that he was boring by their speech .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he drew strong criticism for himself when he said , the Russians should chop the Russians about Clinton , but explained later &quot; &quot; Of course , I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the lingu@@ istic limits to politics and then return to ru@@ ders .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken from his fans , as they arrive , and then , if necessary , &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who watches the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his testimony , so they can be interpreted in various ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of sharp@@ ening the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has adopted an additional sound , since its revers@@ ed values have continued to go back . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , published on Friday , showed a lead with a large lead in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ in @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying to ap@@ point out for its pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he is accused of mis@@ understanding his critics or mis@@ understanding his hum@@ our . &quot;
&quot; but while he is strengthened in focus of attention in the last months of its presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps j@@ okes have brought his loyal ri@@ h@@ ites into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how prov@@ ok@@ ant might be his statements . &quot;
&quot; Rudolph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps prominent inter@@ cess@@ ors , gave himself great effort to defend candidates today in a CNN interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I think what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments , &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he was questioned about Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s correc@@ t@@ ness , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense , that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it back@@ bone , completely false and therefore it was because he drew the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstre@@ am rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to argue that the government served as Foreign Minister , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister , ISIS is allowed to spread out the situation in the Middle East aggressive . &quot;
&quot; before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump was continuing his attacks on the media and threw them before , on each of his words and vo@@ iced against him . &quot;
&quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; poor , mis@@ erable , &quot; TV experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t do it ! &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats sp@@ ik@@ ed about Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s exc@@ use as only a further proof that he is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; once more about the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point comes back &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a fo@@ aming café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which was no Wi @-@ Fi but for 15 years good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , prices from the Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ in front was pushed down by the prices of his Bed@@ ford Avenue . &quot;
&quot; the shop of So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , the Ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 , sold soap in the form of Cup@@ cakes . &quot;
indigenous people as last loss in a genetically modified city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is changing , but I can &apos;t believe that C@@ IS is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is a soap business . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is changing , it is also new inv@@ entive . &quot;
&quot; a restored Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new cafes . &quot;
&quot; he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 , and remained there until the end . &quot;
&quot; as a customer offered to provide money for a new branch office , it was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ guez , 36 , kept much . &quot;
Ver@@ b used the same distributor for Bag@@ els bought the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old Ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment .
he led new ingredients .
on the menu sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ ages like cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é onions .
there are natural bowls .
&quot; the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ guez said that he not@@ ices a st@@ aff@@ ed current to old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also pushed through prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after she had pulled to Green@@ point , she would take the way . &quot;
&quot; after the Ver@@ b had closed , they had a while in the middle of the coffee , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that there was a coffee and on the culture in the Ver@@ b , which was pleasing to me , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee again , even if they ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea with a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea , who is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long@@ standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
&quot; he went there before work , and ordered innocent always . &quot;
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss clock watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and take new ingredients into the menu .
&quot; today Ros@@ enthal gets his usual order , but sometimes it changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez said he did not have a groove about that the soap store has taken the old business space .
&quot; in fact , the owner of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie to make a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold bre@@ wed coffee of the cafe as ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go to their offer , &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ guez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish citizens Green@@ points have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish , and Rodri@@ guez said that he had to make them soon so that his new neighbors will feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has additional advantages .
a local ju@@ t@@ bar wants to fill the cold bre@@ wed coffee into bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café is expanding into a neighbouring building .
&quot; for many customers , a new version is enough to get their old favor@@ ites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed by the ground when the café completed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said the operator of the Lok@@ as and the best coffee felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell the smell , &quot; he said . &quot;
the primitive food of the economic crisis in &quot; a abundant meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his ascent to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took off his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as an host@@ ess , President Roosevelt was a Fai@@ ble for refined Del@@ ic@@ at@@ essen at Fifth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland hydrogen tur@@ tle soup . &quot;
&quot; his menu on this day was a little modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato pur@@ ée and as dessert a p@@ ud@@ ding p@@ ud@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with people , &quot; &quot; said Jane Z@@ iegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; There was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both of food histori@@ ans .
&quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; was about the Chinese kitchen in the USA , while Z@@ iegel@@ man told her life in a residential building at the Lower East Side of food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , s@@ ör@@ gy I@@ mb@@ iss in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the IP@@ crash 1929 . &quot;
&quot; brick , 54 , ordered a Frisch@@ linge , with@@ drew olive trees while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with potato pur@@ ée and vegetable . &quot;
&quot; when the reporter ordered Hack@@ ers , this pair was fitting for a discussion about the food in the era of the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; Z@@ iegel@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; there were pean@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread . &quot;
they were made up of an ingredient and some cheap that the ingredient is stretched .
imagine so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner .
CO@@ e sm@@ iled .
&quot; it has to have laid down in the stomach like lead , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; during the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women co@@ aches for male Fel@@ low and it was freshly baked past@@ ures for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; the Americans , who , during the first World War , were sent to star@@ ving Europeans . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; draws the way to which the country went with it , not to be the Schl@@ ar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot;
&quot; it was a time in the food for the Americans , a central , split theme was , &quot; al@@ lied Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new bud@@ get@@ ed food was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food like bre@@ ads and ch@@ att@@ acking have been re@@ charged as &quot; wonderful way , food waste , re@@ alizing , because ba@@ it could hide un@@ appe@@ ti@@ zing ingredients under a creative sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by low @-@ cost dried fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the focal point of the American kitchen , became a rare luxury for years . &quot;
&quot; unique mix@@ tures were tried , as a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutriti@@ ous satisfaction of satisfaction before taste or even healthy food was understood . &quot;
&quot; during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , Z@@ iegel@@ man prepared a dish from this ep@@ och , baked onions with pean@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it wasn &apos;t a favorite addition to the lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Z@@ iegel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pean@@ ut butter and baked onions are not fit to each other .
it was typical for many of the household items .
&quot; as never before or ever , household appliances - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the country &apos;s eating habits . &quot;
&quot; conf@@ using recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household sp@@ ol@@ iti@@ ves &quot; and the challenge , P@@ amp@@ e as cre@@ mi@@ ge sp@@ aghetti with carrots in delicious meals to be justified . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al , is a celebration of historic treat . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the reports on the response from the government are star@@ ving to star@@ vation citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ food @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple Io@@ wa farms in his kitchen , he sp@@ ei@@ sts like the million@@ th heavy man of the world to which he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cucum@@ ber sauce , &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
he ate in a almost gilded dining room and wore a tu@@ x .
he was a great success .
&quot; President Roosevelt had perhaps committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to stat@@ ute a stamp with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , announ@@ cing a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Ms. Roosevelt said that the White House brought the boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , to deal with food , was rejected when the country came back on the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , Z@@ iegel@@ man said , as well as science was employed on food . &quot;
&quot; in writing , the couple gave to the writing of the book the essential habits of brick @-@ in @-@ law to be better understood - for example , how they could not throw food . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
Z@@ iegel@@ man remembered : &quot; they actually made people sick . &quot;
there was the wind exploited .
&quot; after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they moved with co@@ e a dessert , which they had prepared at home : the Pfl@@ au@@ m@@ end@@ ert , the President Roosevelt at noon . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; said Z@@ iegel@@ man and added that it was a common trick to miss a nice name . &quot;
&quot; there was no proposed cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
each di@@ spar@@ ingly di@@ pped a spoon into the tough , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad . &quot;
CO@@ E got three times a surcharge .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
the hero killed at bombs : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he set his own life to help others : Khaled Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khaled Omar devoted his life to the people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save lives of life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself has died for a facade @-@ attack against the Assad regime .
&quot; Omar was a member of &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group that saved the lives according to picture @-@ newspaper almost 60,000 people . &quot;
29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers put their own life on the game to move people from dist@@ orted houses and to make their first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civilian sho@@ ots that shows him on a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a house from the ruins of a house was around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians to the lumin@@ ous symbol in the grave of the war .
&quot; but as heroes , he never saw himself , said according to the picture : &quot; for me , this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die , save lives , I think that God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; just before Omar &apos;s attack herself fell victim to the attack , he talked about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have thrown four facade bombs above the Alzheimer &apos;s district , one was filled with chlor@@ ophyll . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing . &quot;
&quot; we now remove the po@@ ison@@ ous remn@@ ants of the bomb , so that not children play with it , &quot; quoted the picture his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Green@@ land@@ hai : the oldest cycl@@ one is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie usually come to the surface only in winter .
this ha@@ i was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board ship S@@ anna .
&quot; he was born in 16@@ 24 , and flo@@ ats with a 1 km / h in the North Atlantic - until today . &quot;
Greenland &apos;s get up with 150 years of young offspring .
&quot; on the bottom of the North Atlantic , Greenland is located on average at 1,@@ 220 meters far in an hour . &quot;
&quot; only when it comes to it , the five @-@ metre animal acceler@@ ates at a sat@@ te 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Rob@@ be . &quot;
&quot; this lifestyle , however , seems to be a bul@@ let concept for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen , from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report on the journal &quot; Science &quot; in any case of a Greenland , which could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; commented on Alexander Sch@@ eme from the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock , this lif@@ esp@@ an , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the Evol@@ ution@@ ary biolog@@ ist suspected that Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie become rocky . &quot;
only failed the evidence .
&quot; Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie are difficult to observe , finally they live mainly in the Ice Sea off the thin populated coast of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they are water @-@ temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface usually in the winter . &quot;
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie .
their time @-@ bends left them when they took six animals with a broad@@ caster in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
&quot; nevertheless , these shar@@ ks make this shar@@ ks still : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another one had swallowed up a young king@@ fis@@ her . &quot;
&quot; maybe they hunt , sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice cream and are looking for cad@@ ets , which are tor@@ ily from higher water layers . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , during the biggest 502 @-@ centi@@ meter . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of animals , they analyzed the lens core of the shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; the eye lens is born before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which contained in the proteins , will not be renewed later . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
&quot; their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s , when atomic tests attempts to to@@ w larger quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; at 220 centi@@ meters in length , the lens core contained a low excess of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapon , it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday at its investigation in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; in its lens core , all larger Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks had a normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts due to cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 @-@ centi@@ metre @-@ long Green@@ land@@ hai showed a age of 335 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 502 centi@@ meters could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
now the researchers were able to arrange an old age .
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centi@@ meters probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and at the age of 156 , Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks with the multip@@ lication has become at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
this is likely to be the world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live particularly in icy waters is no coincidence .
&quot; the old record holder , a 211 year old Grön@@ land@@ w@@ al , put on the neck of a 120 @-@ year old har@@ po@@ on top , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to low temperatures often , the organism of living animals live in as@@ yn@@ x . &quot;
so they mature then - and lows slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in cold water , animals are often very large . &quot;
&quot; the volume is growing much faster than its surface , through which the animal does heat heat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much bigger than at one gram of elephant . &quot;
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; thus , a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on it , as possible as many descendants , &quot; explains the evol@@ ution@@ ary biolog@@ ist shaft . &quot;
&quot; a very big beast , however , should invest more in a long life . &quot;
building site in double pack
&quot; with topics around the building , the municipal council dealt with focus on the most recent session . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the panel accepted the release of Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the marketing of recent housing can be started . &quot;
&quot; after the plot and security issues are clari@@ fied and the application could be put on survey@@ ing , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; road road &quot; and &quot; &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; &quot; area ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - section section 1 ) are interested in the way to interested parties . &quot;
&quot; the Municipal Council is convinced that the blo@@ wer in the rural and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau , young families , and rü@@ e elderly are alike . &quot;
&quot; as it was said , building consent began to report from now in the City Hall , on the awar@@ ding of the plots is expected to be advised in its September session . &quot;
&quot; to further inquiries to the res@@ ett@@ lement of further business farms , together with the creation of job creation , the council decided that the municipal plan decided not to change in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; in the Unter@@ tim@@ ec@@ n area , there is already a proven commercial area around two plots towards state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benef@@ ited from Bre@@ xit
&quot; the city at Main has correspon@@ ded with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg as well as the best opportunities to attract jobs and companies from London . &quot;
&quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit from the Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the Compet@@ ence of Financial Markets and Real Estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether money stores continue from London from financial transactions in the entire EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , it is enough to have the approval in the UK . &quot;
they just use large US banks .
&quot; several banks have already announced , to leave jobs . &quot;
&quot; the lob@@ b@@ ying Association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance , &quot; expects a 10000 new job in the Main for five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , united responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks of the euro zone , as well as further important authorities as European insurance view E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) took their headquarters , but this is less important for the financial sector less than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the bank@@ note is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; in Luxembourg , a large fund business , but as well as Dublin did worse in the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the great airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach . &quot;
also the city with slightly available commercial real estate .
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Seine , the ten@@ ders for first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as fewer crimin@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the corporate consulting Mer@@ cer rise the city in place 7 , Luxemburg on No.@@ 19 , Dublin at No. 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even though quality of life might be a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; with its strong position as a financial centre for the European domestic market , Frankfurt could attract other banks and investors , &quot; the I@@ W has to be successful . &quot;
&quot; London , however , will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite the Bre@@ xit vote . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , in accordance with the numbers of Landesbank Hel@@ aba , in London , roughly 14@@ 4000 people worked in the banking sector , in Frankfurt , it was 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead receives legal costs of the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. National Security decided that Gilead will be entitled to the re@@ funds of legal costs which have taken from the Hep@@ at@@ its C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June Gilead was freed from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , who stood in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster @-@ medicines of Sov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ v@@ oni of Gilead , after a US judge issued a pattern of mis@@ conduct on Mer@@ cks , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other un@@ ethical actions . &quot;
&quot; at the survey of the law@@ suit on Thursday , U.S. National Police declared Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman , that Gilead is entitled to charge the costs incur@@ red during the defence of the F@@ alles . &quot;
Mer@@ ck tries to connect the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications which can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck was involved in each other and co @-@ def@@ endants and ownership to laboratory work , such as Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vi@@ r , the active ingredient in the drug of Gilead . &quot;
&quot; by the US , troops say that they have re@@ conquered full control of Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; supported by the USA , the complete control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after having left the last IS fighters in the city , said a speaker of the group on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) , after the extract of the remaining group of fighters that have dug within the city , currently the city . &quot;
&quot; they have liberated over 2,000 civilian individuals who were held ho@@ stage by fighters as host@@ ages , by the D@@ KS held by the D@@ KS Military Council Reuters . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we are going to work with &quot; , &quot; he told Reuters . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , Clinton earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % of the Federal Constitutional Court &quot;
&quot; Hillary Clinton published their tax declaration for 2015 , which resulted in the Presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective Bundes@@ tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton donated US $ 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to Clinton Foundation ; former president Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ emer ; the former Foreign Minister gave an income of USD 3 million from Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster to their book on their office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ ton &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ president , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton , his tax declar@@ ations of the last ten years . &quot;
you paid an effective tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hillary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ins continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; by Clin@@ ton Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ hel@@ fer@@ in Jennifer Pal@@ mer in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a sharp contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hi@@ des behind false identity and back in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; it is usual for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declar@@ ations , although they are not obliged by the law . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers argu@@ ed as a reason for his ref@@ us@@ al to tax the tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign in Ian &apos;s on Twitter , regarding the publication of the Presidential candidate in the Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en said , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Advisor to CNN that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the control tests are not completed . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , including the Republi@@ can Presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already abandoned his ref@@ us@@ al issues related to assets , his donations for charity organisations , his business divisions and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
&quot; Clinton already over@@ threw a video on the Internet on Friday and released a video on the Internet on Friday , in which the high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump will publish his tax statement . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , she said the subject of a speech on the economy in Michigan . &quot;
he ref@@ uses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in the past decades and to publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot; she said about the crowd .
&quot; POL@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that Tr@@ ump has not been paid for two years or only very little taxes , and an economic journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax ev@@ asion and tax advis@@ ors that could still be the case . &quot;
Federal Government has become a theme in the election campaign .
&quot; Clinton also supports a regulation , which is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ets that will make sure that people earn more than USD 1 million , paying a tax rate of at least 30 % . &quot;
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during a campaign for Hillary Clinton in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for buff@@ ets , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ ek@@ on@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters here , Tr@@ ump on a meeting in order to exchange their tax declar@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ets said he was subjected to a control test of the IRS , and tr@@ ump have &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; before the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; in the year 2007 , he has released tax returns to the year 2007 . &quot;
&quot; the Clin@@ s , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , we paid an effective tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective tax rate of approximately 40@@ ,5 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the financial statements of the Clinton &apos;s fiscal year showed that this is only USD 100 of their income as a salary , unlike the majority of all Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main schol@@ ars was a cost @-@ effective In@@ dex@@ fund , in which Clin@@ ics Divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings of USD 10@@ 9,000 . &quot;

&quot; con@@ doms with chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ work lo@@ ung@@ ers encourage Tanz@@ anian elephant safety &quot;
&quot; natural shel@@ ters in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox species to keep eleph@@ ants from it , in people inhabited settlements - they throw themselves the con@@ doms of them that are filled with chi@@ li@@ pu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; the method has proved effective as effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which intensi@@ fied the idea earlier years by intensi@@ fying volunteers in the North of Tanzania by exp@@ orting a non@@ violent square method to protect their houses and har@@ vest@@ ing without suffering animals . &quot;
previously many speakers have used to defend themselves .
&quot; Friday , global warming is dedicated to animal protection . &quot;
&quot; ever since we have developed the tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in these municipalities with much more confidence that they cannot damage the eleph@@ ants from their fields without losing the elephant , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Damian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles into a horn .
&quot; if he is not stran@@ gled , a so @-@ called &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der mixed with Earth is packed together with a fire@@ work lo@@ ids in a con@@ dom , whose end up to the ignition only turns turns . &quot;
&quot; when it lighted off , the con@@ dom is placed with a buttons and spra@@ ying fine dust to chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der into the air . &quot;
&quot; as a rule , a hint is usually made to hunt the eleph@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; a last possibility represents a wor@@ fer that sho@@ ots a gold blow in the air and caused a lu@@ te , light explosion . &quot;

Jewish director defe@@ ats Berlin hotel because Israeli pre@@ fix was to be removed after &quot; Arab . &quot; - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots has unle@@ ashed a media watch after he betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not have any Israeli pre@@ fix , since it would have requested Arabic guests according to an employee . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust Docum@@ entation &quot; Sho@@ a , &quot; wrote his anger in the Kemp@@ in@@ sky Bristol Hotel in Berlin by expl@@ aining an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann was trying to find Israel on the list of the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed between countries which can be accessed directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , is possible that Israel eliminated and was deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers an opportunity to select Israel beyond its own call center . &quot;
&quot; after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel recep@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; the answer , which he received there , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel noted that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
&quot; the reason that stood behind , dissolved in the director even more fur@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre@@ fix is deleted , &quot; the employees of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; big dis@@ grace &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied and troubled about this event .
that is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
the fact that this is written in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater dis@@ grace .
no explanation is needed .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident triggered a fairly large response to the Internet , when people called it a scandal . &quot;
some under@@ lined the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have been given to the alleged di@@ or@@ age of Arab guests .
&quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful , &quot; &quot; it was said in another post that it was pointed out that the hotel is situated on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly proved all the accus@@ ations of themselves , and called the incident &quot; Ver@@ see &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; by Lanz@@ mann , reports the mirror . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; Israel did not include in the high @-@ ranking list , &quot; quoted the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
it adds that the country code is now added .
police sets tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Gum@@ mig@@ esch@@ ke against protest@@ ing Brazilian students
students arrive on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police when they gathered to demonstrate against the reform of the government for public education system .
the police put tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and rub@@ bers against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began , as a police officer attempted to extract the students , which led the police , rubber @-@ fin and tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as police . &quot;
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
&quot; according to the proposals for the Governor of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the participants have seen gra@@ ff@@ it@@ its against the preliminary President Michel T@@ emer &apos;s walls .
&quot; the recent protests took place some days after demonstr@@ ators went into the streets to support the sus@@ pen@@ ed president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , which had been postpon@@ ed by a vote by the Senate &apos;s vote . &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade between Moscow and Teheran , grew by 7@@ 0.9 percent , according to the Russian ambassador to Iran . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in the Russian company grew strong on shops in the country , divided the ambassador . &quot;
&quot; Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to get access to the market . &quot;
&quot; of course , the further trade is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot;
&quot; he noted that the trade rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 , and $ 8@@ 56 million . &quot;
&quot; in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in particular , and tot@@ alled $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran climbed by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; commercial swing was achieved by deliveries of machines , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year .
&quot; last year , the Russian Federation represented some 35,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel agent , to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries that concerns the tourist numbers in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record number of Iranian tourists will be broken in Russia from last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d to receive the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;
witnesses searched for : beverage market survived in forest oil
a pre@@ dat@@ er fall is practic@@ ed on Thursday night on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ der Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under gu@@ ing of a fire@@ arm , they demanded three dark @-@ wearing people who susp@@ ects their faces , followed by the staff of the beverage market , initially at walking and then probably with a silver @-@ coloured VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money was captured , the police doesn &apos;t share . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rators should have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1,@@ 70 meters , so relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
&quot; the perpet@@ rators must be sc@@ anned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Way , and from opposite to the parking house with the silver coloured car , possibly in the direction B 256 ( sleep ring ring ) . &quot;
who made the observations on the tat@@ too ( at 7.@@ 45 o &apos;clock ) that are in connection with the pre@@ dat@@ or should be urgent in the police .

in the quiet Frei@@ zei@@ thei@@ m Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ idle was the life @-@ joyful group during the first school week .
several full day trips stood on the program .
&quot; for one , it went to Britt@@ ten with the visit of the string . &quot;
&quot; to the other according to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special nursery school in the world famous monastery . &quot;
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : Pil@@ gri@@ ds to mercy to mercy
the minist@@ rants from the past@@ oral care unit Ey@@ der@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the road on a four @-@ day Pil@@ gri@@ mage of Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together four stages are carried out .
&quot; in order to over@@ bridges the period until the next Rom@@ ance journey of all ministers in two years , the Ober@@ minist@@ erial round St. Anna has decided to prepare and implementation of a multi @-@ day fung@@ us emig@@ ration . &quot;
&quot; various pilgrimage goals was verified and was finally decided for the Bish@@ ops of Freiburg , where the Holy Year of Charity was given a special pilgrimage to commem@@ orate the Holy Year of Charity at the Frei@@ burger Münster , Germany , on the occasion of the Holy Year . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is made of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and T@@ ables are on the way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , Rev. Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , he blessed the pilgrimage and shared the pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b , he was driven by train to the Vill@@ ingen starting point , where a Mu@@ es@@ man On@@ es is standing , and so the pilgrimage was held from Münster . &quot;
&quot; the single day tours were framed in the morning and evening , depending on a brief imp@@ etus with different prayers , songs and lyrics . &quot;
&quot; but on the way , the Min@@ is made to Feld@@ cruci@@ fy , chap@@ els or churches , together again , together to sing together a song from a separate pilgrims program together . &quot;
&quot; for the nights , each par@@ enth@@ eses of the local parish were available . &quot;
&quot; on the Et@@ app@@ rais@@ al , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller for a tasty and high dinner and breakfast . &quot;
on the second day they went on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to G@@ üt@@ enbach .
&quot; tags follows the stage to St. Peter , who was the most exhau@@ sting way , but at the high school level , some 500 metres of altitude had to come down and recovered thereafter . &quot;
the served reward was a dinner at the bath in the evening .
&quot; after the morning , the fourth day of pilgrims in the impos@@ ing monastery church of St. Peter went to the final stage to Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; intenti@@ onally reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is met in the late afternoon at the Frei@@ burger Münster , and advanced the gates of mercy . &quot;
&quot; with a small imp@@ etus , God was thanks to God . &quot;
&quot; at the evening mass in Münster , the Min@@ is was welcomed by Ko@@ operator Markus O@@ bert . &quot;
&quot; after the divine service , pilgrims could visit the vest@@ ry and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was still time for the break @-@ up metropolis .
in the afternoon there went by train back to Hor@@ b .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spiritu@@ ality and a strong community experience were min@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; Scot@@ sman Call@@ um S@@ kin@@ ner stor@@ ming home , as Br@@ ite gold for cycling &quot;
&quot; Scotland Call@@ um S@@ kin@@ ner ra@@ ste last night in the men &apos;s team Sprint at the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio , when the British team defended the title of London 2012 . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor , who had made his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y . he made the legend as he stor@@ med for his home to visit a victory from the favour@@ ites of New Zealand . &quot;
&quot; England claimed a sho@@ cking victory over four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of the six Olympi@@ ag@@ old@@ medals . &quot;
&quot; they repeated the trick , after she took place in March at the train World Championships in London despite the return of Ho@@ ys , just a modest sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as execution .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap to close K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton tried .
&quot; S@@ kin@@ ner was the man where they remained , when they saw potential in the mo@@ ck , which now un@@ folds . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who won four years ago with Ho@@ y Win@@ ner - and S@@ kin@@ ner prevailed over the qualification round , but in the Stand@@ ar@@ round the New Zealand came in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the Du@@ el with gold .
&quot; round trip back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and S@@ kin@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a strategy change made a large part of the transformation , when exec@@ uting a higher course to slow it down and to make it Kenn@@ y and especially S@@ kin@@ ner to keep the temp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y saw from his position as a BBC expert , S@@ kin@@ ner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they came to the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old S@@ kin@@ ner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m only here to do my best and make me a name .
we set up an Olympic police in the final round and defeated the world champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the 2012 triumph at the site Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Behin@@ d that he fell down to the railway after a weak start . &quot;
he moved this statement later and there was no objec@@ tion of England rival .
for such a exagger@@ ated victory there was no problem for this time .
Hin@@ des said : &quot; it feels like the whole GB flags on the grand@@ stand as London .
we joined the team in the last three months .
&quot; we have been so bad for so many World tit@@ els so bad , that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation who won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if that is a barometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days at the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the shape of Kenn@@ y , it is possible in the field of possibility that he repe@@ ats a victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; that would be exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( apparently a holy date for British sports ; on the day , Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster ) were born at the same day - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
the cage of Ho@@ y is equal .
&quot; Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int , which starts today and will go over three days . &quot;
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
&quot; it feels too lon@@ ely , to win alone . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; If he won two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only med@@ alli@@ sts of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ ve Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ bs qualified himself with the fastest power in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race . &quot;
they came to 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
&quot; the world record , which won in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held on the second day of the competition , at which Wig@@ gins will be focused on security . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , he had disputed himself with admir@@ ing before the qualification , when the officials call him to measure his body size . &quot;
&quot; in the appropriate women &apos;s competition , the tomorrow continued and ended , av@@ anc@@ ated Laura Des@@ p@@ ite , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in the world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the UK team is leaving its strong train team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a ch@@ ar to medals .
&quot; after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , expectations were driven for Rio . &quot;
&quot; it played Dr@@ amas in the background , so the resignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April was in the midst of Sex@@ ism and M@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ fen , as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , when one sees the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite then , as the legendary reputation of GB@@ S , which has reached the perfect moment its peak is repeated . &quot;
&quot; future of melt from Portland due to elev@@ ating the energy agreement , &quot;
&quot; the future of aluminium mel@@ ts from Portland in Victoria , as well as hundreds of jobs from workers - are on the game , as the system operator will termin@@ ate the energy contract and thus order all delivery contracts , as the supplier of energy companies will declare . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to the operation of the plant . &quot;
one for 20 years of fixed sub@@ sid@@ y runs in November .
&quot; up to 2000 work@@ stations in the Al@@ coa facility in Portland , Germany . &quot;
&quot; not less than 2000 work@@ stations -@@ direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it could come to domin@@ ation , as the melt consumes around 10 per cent of the total electricity generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry melt that led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year . &quot;
the melt of Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and ris@@ ky a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulations on the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium mel@@ ts with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ Am Valley , divided that three additional owners will termin@@ ate their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the facility is in the majority possession of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p will hold smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland , which means another physical demand for electricity through the melt &quot; &quot; divided the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continues to say that the &quot; &quot; securing stores &quot; , &quot; which will be in force from November 2016 onwards . &quot;
&quot; the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period , so they will end in 2017 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the business year will contribute to the revenue &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
all potential impact on the money on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong dates for wholesale electricity prices .
&quot; AG@@ L divided the value of contracts already in its yearly ab@@ us@@ al amount of $ 187 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a termination &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Al@@ coa said that the decision to book contracts that the &quot; ability of Alco@@ hol ... the melting of the melting or ensure the power supply to the melting &quot; do not affect .
&quot; the U.S. company said that it had completed a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have entered into force from November this year , even if there is still an explanation , why it is re@@ signed from the contract . &quot;
analysts were war@@ n due to the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle .
&quot; in reference to the statements of the analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland uses around 600 mega@@ watts of electricity annually . &quot;
both systems should disappear from the market would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; energy market &#93; .
&quot; and for us as a generator , it would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just one Kar@@ das@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the sept@@ et issue of the Vog@@ ue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner C@@ lans Kris is based on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the U.S. Vog@@ ue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the latest news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , I brought me to the view of this co@@ vers to weeping , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot;
the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an &apos;s like ? ) : forget the whole Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ ony@@ i and the presence of all the most popular Show@@ bi@@ z @-@ On@@ cles and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) : they all have a surprise party planned .
&quot; this creates virtually every birthday party in the area , &quot; You thought that we had forgotten you ? &quot; &quot; with hon@@ esty of a drawing centre at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning , but Kris had to be able to participate in this public@@ ity . &quot;
with regard to the September issue of the Vog@@ ue with safety a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans started .
&quot; K@@ end@@ alls great sister Kim likes her to be beaten with what the Vog@@ ue Cover ( her and her husband Kan@@ ye West were seen on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for themselves . &quot;
the Sept@@ ember@@ issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vog@@ ue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that is rather resem@@ bles a fashion magazine rather than a fashion magazine , the output has a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista products from the 8@@ 32 pages of the Bear@@ er 615 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the revel@@ ing of his Co@@ ver@@ stars is eag@@ erly expected that in the last two years the journal was made to le@@ ak@@ age before the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover were Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , there were clearly more &quot; celebr@@ ities , the model &quot; as &quot; models , the celebr@@ ities &quot; are on the cover . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , Oscar @-@ Prize lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or @-@ Mark@@ enb@@ ot@@ ee Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour . &quot;
&quot; but even in the low chance that Ms. J@@ enner - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; break model &quot; of its generation - under the former category , it is in a good company . &quot;
these celebr@@ ities are not related to famous people or reality stars or you@@ ths from today who know how to find a good Snap@@ chat video ( even though it applies to J@@ enner ) .
they are really talented women who draw themselves in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of their career . &quot;
naturally J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success anyone .
&quot; with their reality @-@ TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers had always ten@@ se something ten@@ se in the fashion world . &quot;
&quot; in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephanie Sey@@ m@@ our J@@ enner and their colleagues called &quot; &quot; the Mist@@ akes of the eye &quot; . &quot; &quot;
these feelings rel@@ ays high when the news came out with the release J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue Cover .
but at the mis@@ ery it seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the sept@@ et issue of the Vog@@ ue .
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense of the word , it is a super@@ model . &quot;
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
&quot; it makes advertising for your base , by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der . &quot;
you and all her sisters sell pictures from their respective Pay@@ wall Apps .
she sells from her made images of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine LO@@ VE .

&quot; more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s most likely need to be rejected by the community centre each year , while the industry accounts for the impact of further medium cuts on over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Queensland , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for odd Del@@ og@@ ations and the similar , have been referred to free legal advice and legal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already booked out@@ dated , are prepared for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; starting in June , next year , we will be able to lose further 30 percent of their federal agents . &quot;
the Director of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of municipal centers revealed that thousands of people were dismissed every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation could only be worse by the government &apos;s decision .
&quot; Queens@@ bury Common centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means thousands of people from important services you need to be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who left violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and op@@ pres@@ sive debt , families who have been dischar@@ ged by divi@@ den@@ ies - all these people have problems righ@@ tful way that they can &apos;t get the help you need . &quot;
&quot; as of June 2017 , the Federal Government will reduce the funds by 30 percent , which means that thousands of hel@@ pers need to be forced out of Queensland with their legal problems without any assistance . &quot;
&quot; we call for the General Prosecutor and the Federal Minister of the Federal Minister and Sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to raise these middle distances immediately , so the people can get the help you need for legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government filled its promise to raise funds for legal action on the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now at the time to view the needs of community centres and their customer communities , as well as the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k invested in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign indicted after employees supposedly went weapon
&quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign has been indicted for alleged in@@ activity after being informed that their Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ manager for North Carolina had been on a staff in February , while they were travelling by a Jeep in February . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in a bill of indictment , which was submitted on Wednesday at the State Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software program for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ordin@@ i gave an opportunity to have waited for months , that the matter would be internally regulated before he re@@ alizes that &quot; this would not happen . &quot;
&quot; the campaign manager , Earl Philip , &quot; moved a pist@@ ol , put his right hands on the withdrawal , and r@@ amm@@ ed the course in Vinc@@ ente Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; gave B@@ ordin@@ i in his charge . &quot;
&quot; after having received himself with the local and regional struggle management , B@@ ordin@@ i noted that at least four other people had done the same experience with Philli@@ p , he was charged with the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to host damage , &quot; there was B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the indictment took only two days after the Republi@@ can Presidential candidate dis@@ b@@ ted a ri@@ ot , when he should take a crowd of lives in North Carolina , that the &quot; second Am@@ end@@ ment people &quot; &quot; should take action if his ri@@ val@@ in Hillary Clinton should be elected and judges . &quot;

Berlin / Schwerin : survey before countries of countries : SPD and CDU
&quot; during the upcoming elections in the federal states Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , significant losses for the governing party of the SPD and the CDU . &quot;
this revealed representative p@@ olls of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could reg@@ ain in the north , this is not possible according to the survey value in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have had good chances to continue their head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD collapsed from 3@@ 5.6 percent to 24 percent five years ago . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party had only slightly ahead of the CDU that could rise to 23 per cent . &quot;
the third place is fought between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left vis to 19 per cent ( previously 18.@@ 4 per cent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country . &quot;
&quot; despite a slight losses of 6 per cent ( before 8.7 percent ) , the Gre@@ ens are rising again in the s@@ wis@@ s country day . &quot;
&quot; with 3 percent , N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the country &apos;s country . &quot;
&quot; according to the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ uties , the SPD responsible for the survey was only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CDU was only 18 percent after 22.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; however , they are still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left , with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the House of Represent@@ atives .
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope to return , the pirates would like to miss out in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
E @-@ Mail and Internet in Tim@@ lu@@ pe : Nokia Communic@@ ator stood on the market 20 years ago .
the successor today domin@@ ate the world - his manufacturers experienced a disaster .
the unit weighs almost half kilograms and was more than four times as difficult as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was th@@ icker and larger , it was therefore not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite strange . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in storage at the beginning was eight Meg@@ abytes , which would be enough for about two sel@@ fers with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ abytes .
&quot; the Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator was exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros , lovers of devices can still buy on the Internet , but they come from the Stone Age of the internet . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone producer had announced the product a few months earlier on the computer trade fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as &quot; office in the West @-@ bottle format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received a lot : SMS and emails were sent and received , also by fax , the communic@@ ator was to be reached . &quot;
&quot; even the access to web pages was possible by HTML browser , if too slow . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and a electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone was similar to a laptop . &quot;
then a little keyboard and a black and white screen found .
&quot; quite proud , the price was : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euros . &quot;
the average sales price of smartphones in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could ways in August 1996 that communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
everything since then is different .
the smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
&quot; the cell map of Finn@@ s experienced a unprecedented disaster , finally sold to Microsoft , and is handled . &quot;
&quot; today , the market domin@@ ates suppliers , which came all much later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; still and everywhere , this is today for very many people everyday life . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; some 1.4 billion devices have been sold , on Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units . &quot;
global sales with the devices will be around 400 billion euros .
&quot; to this end , the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunic@@ ations concerts are coming . &quot;
&quot; around the smartphone , a whole industry has been developed . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough on the mass market was first released in early 2007 , at that time , Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced on Mac @-@ World &apos;s introduction to the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communications , easy to use by touch screen . &quot;
&quot; the triumph@@ al train of Apple began , today the iPhone is the most important product of the corporation . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the watch . &quot;
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
now we have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after its invention .
&quot; on average , every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we all have to learn the smartphone even time , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina bul@@ let , in the Siemens executive board for staff . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and Heathrow
&quot; Heathrow will not only be in our local municipalities and throughout London , but throughout the country renewal and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; for me this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow , just as it was in 2012 in London , when we had a big effort to ensure that all our nations and regions prof@@ ited from games . &quot;
the Olympics brought great benefits for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and this will be possible again by creating new possibilities for the local and companies near Heathrow .
&quot; for our local communities , we will have 10,000 new teachers , create 40,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the air environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead to us in London 2012 , there will be those who think that the challenge of the enlargement of the enlar@@ ges is great . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and we will bl@@ am@@ aze us at the world stage .
the two were wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with Heathrow .
&quot; there are always obstacles to over@@ coming , but Heathrow answers every question . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , Heathrow is for many and not for individual infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , creating £ 211 billion in growth growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment for both the airport as well as in whole GB . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in Heathrow , which has been implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure program in time and budget , from the T5 , which was built five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 which was built in the midst of the two frequ@@ ented Lauf@@ ste@@ es in the world . &quot;
now they are ready to deliver a third run@@ way which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of Heathrow will also be one .
&quot; it is time that we expand this Olympic spirit and expand to Heathrow and create our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment , which can be proud of England . &quot;

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz @-@ and mouse &quot; &quot; concerning display block &quot;
&quot; according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to handle advertis@@ ements blocking , a &quot; Kat@@ z@@ - and mouse game &quot; play , according to one of the software manufacturers . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook , Ad@@ block Plus would block a blo@@ gger on his desktop side , in which it hur@@ ried that users could upgrade their filters in the program to block once more advertising on social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared with that his desktop @-@ page would change the coding regarding his advertis@@ ements to identify the display of advertis@@ ements that is part of the site advertising to complain . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to get the new codes .
&quot; in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ forth @-@ struggle between the an@@ zei@@ ting open source community and the h@@ unters have already been underway since the invention of advertis@@ ements &quot; &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has settled in the fight for social media in the struggle , is a strong indi@@ ct@@ ance to become how to become an ar@@ ous@@ al display lock@@ ers for the industry . &quot;
&quot; according to a study carried out by Pa@@ sp@@ air in the world , according to a study carried out by Pa@@ m@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people use display items ; almost four times as much as 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users active users who access Facebook on their mobile end devices , Hand@@ y@@ advert@@ ise makes 84 percent of advertising results . &quot;
&quot; in addition to mobile ad block@@ ers , the company has no effect on fac@@ ebooks mobile app for social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared one speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient big share of income , so Facebook appears to be worth a step as worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared with that it would be &quot; &quot; ad pre@@ ference tool &quot; to have more control over them being targeted advertis@@ ements . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook decided that Ad@@ blocks would have wor@@ r@@ ying new filters because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users do not represent a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , shared one speaker of Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a silent means , why we have focused on the Develop@@ er tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences instead , to lay more control into the hands of the people . &quot;
woman with susp@@ icious suicide on Swiss free@@ way
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
&quot; the police call witnesses , after a woman took over the early morning hours on Thursday at a susp@@ icious car of several vehicles on a highway . &quot;
the incident occurred at the A1 near Morges in the canton of Wa@@ adt shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; in a act of desp@@ air &quot; on the streets and were hit by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss age at the age of 49 , which was over by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she died still on site .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some are still not identified yet , the police , those as well as every witnesses of the incident , said to report . &quot;
&quot; an investigation process was opened , what a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation divided G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to wait if one of the driver will be displayed . &quot;
was a crash avo@@ id@@ able ?
&quot; that is something that the prosecutor must decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver will not be pulled to responsibility .
&quot; in each of the two cases - a person in the dark on the highway ran - it was decided that motor@@ ists would not assume that pede@@ stri@@ ans run in the middle of the night on the highway , as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a polic@@ eman had acquitted the charges after having passed a man and killed a night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne , in August 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk , and was un@@ conscious of the road , taking the judgment . &quot;
&quot; the court noted that the polic@@ eman had answered on an emergency call -- on a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road was an &quot; completely extraordinary and un@@ pre@@ dict@@ able situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
&quot; everyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges , should report at the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot;
NASA Klim@@ am@@ o@@ dell : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
&quot; according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably inhab@@ itable . &quot;
&quot; at Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies , NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorith@@ ms , similar to those of climate research . &quot;
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once had been observed in similar conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously noted that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , drow@@ ned atmosphere , and nevertheless slowly turned on . &quot;
the model illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably proved more dry places than de Earth , but once had enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from faster ev@@ ap@@ oration . &quot;
&quot; the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun , which was 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow revolution of Venus exp@@ on@@ ated its day side of the Sun for almost two months , &quot; G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io explained in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this is war@@ med the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds that affects the surface of a large part of the solar heat . &quot;
&quot; the result are average temperatures , which are a few degrees cooler than that of the Earth today . &quot;
&quot; the model brought forth a story of Venus , which resem@@ bles evolution that was suspected earlier by Plan@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; although they probably inhab@@ itable , Venus had been exposed to a lot of heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billion years . &quot;
their oceans ev@@ ap@@ orated and their water vap@@ or was burned down by the ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as her hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere was left to carbon dioxide with a fatal greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know them today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy coming back as trainer of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy coming back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a slow co @-@ determination of the team &apos;s decision making .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately search for a new coach . &quot;
&quot; in the last three years I have met my duties as chief trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determin@@ at@@ eness , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy expressed in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; over the summer of this summer , I thought a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth to give it more depth and bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations has to be perfectly matched to the organisation . &quot;
he must also have a shared deal with decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not fulfilled .
&quot; Sak@@ ic who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank him for his contributions for the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick has informed me this decision today , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we all appreciate what he did for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy has been awarded the Best Trainer of the League during his debut season 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of Jack Adams awards .
&quot; he led the association to 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed in each of the last two years . &quot;

nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers take talks again on , put strike &quot;
&quot; the labour struggles concerning the re@@ mun@@ eration for North Sea labor@@ ers are exposed , while all the parties are set for a new talk round at the table , said negoti@@ ator . &quot;
strikes against the Wood Field Service Wood Group have been carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea that are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; Wood Group , as well as the un@@ ites and en@@ mt trade unions can confirm that we are united to re @-@ start the winding process of current battle , &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot;
&quot; we will hold some full day sessions in the coming weeks , starting the beginning of the next year to restart the problems . &quot;
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year Wood Group has cut the rates of its contra@@ ctors in the North Sea by around 9 percent , due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s ratings follows a 10 percent decline in on@@ shore contra@@ ctors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company needed the necessary room to come across the market down@@ turn .
&quot; Shell has released and plans for its part of thousands of people and plans to im@@ pose its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ us@@ dial telephone with the British energy company BG Group ration@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are due to the lower crude oil prices under pressure , a economic situation that intensi@@ fied by the British in June to aband@@ on the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish member of the Parliament Dave Anderson met at the beginning of this week with workers &quot; leaders , to discuss one of the greatest labour @-@ disp@@ utes , which have been held since a generation in the North Sea . &quot;
&quot; North Sea is important for regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need a business that works for many and not only for few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion in total spending will be expected for new projects in the North Sea in comparison to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the star@@ ches of the Ple@@ y@@ ades
&quot; the latest mission with the Kepler Wel@@ dream teles@@ cope has helped by astronom@@ ers , the most complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars of the constellation of the Ple@@ y@@ ades . &quot;
&quot; the new data help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars are rotating at different rates , as well as in which context the rot@@ ational periods are standing with the planet . &quot;
&quot; we hope that we learn through the comparison of our results with other constellation , more about the relationship between the mass of a star@@ ry , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star@@ ches of the Ple@@ y@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light@@ years away from the earth .
&quot; many stars appeared in this constellation , which began around 125 million years ago , reach the adult . &quot;
they now turn the fastest .
&quot; to top ro@@ aming rates , these gri@@ pping stars p@@ ushing great quantities of stars . &quot;
&quot; since these winds are travelling by the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is al@@ igned , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Kepler measures the rotation rate of any star by taking the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ zable star fle@@ cks -- like sun@@ spots -- det@@ ects .
&quot; the latest catalog of rotary rates indicates that there are more massive stars slower than a lower massive star . &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars of dancers , with greater stars slower pist@@ ach@@ ettes more than smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of Ple@@ y@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors may be ten@@ ding to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors may be ten@@ ding to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot;
&quot; as the constellation of the Ple@@ y@@ ades is so close , it serves as the ideal cosmetic laboratory to compare primary qualities such as rotary rates . &quot;
&quot; the star@@ ches of the Ple@@ y@@ ades provides an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot;
&quot; there is still a lot ahead of us what we like to know more about how , when and why stars down their rot@@ ations , and so to speak to their &quot; dance shoes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rotary rates of the Ple@@ y@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball star occurs from

&quot; after his emotional withdrawal announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will carry the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game participants of the major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ guez was elected the most valuable player of the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , his signature was 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 . &quot;
&quot; by the end of the contra@@ diction on December 31 , 2017 , he served as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary . &quot;
&quot; as a player , Rodri@@ guez paid a long time with performance . &quot;
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle navy ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he made the Yan@@ ke@@ es a few mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame members , H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays show only two other bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics similar . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be absorbed yet in the glory hall of the bas@@ eb@@ alls . &quot;
because so successfully Rodri@@ guez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - on the field was so controversial his appearance outside the place .
&quot; in 2009 , the Super@@ star at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; was released , between 2001 and 2003 , the ster@@ oids was prohibited . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was imprisoned in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis scandal by the end of 2014 for 211 games . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez is deemed to have been a major susp@@ ect for years over an anti @-@ aging clinic in Süd @-@ Florida .
&quot; after a legal dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters . &quot;
&quot; the league could even have done a pleasure for 2014 , because I have played 20 years without a break , Rodri@@ guez said at that time . &quot;
even his deportation days are not no@@ is@@ eless .
during many bas@@ eball legends in their last play the big stage had to get Rodri@@ guez sitting frequently on the bank .

&quot; before the seventh competition , the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ es became known for the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter steep@@ le obstacles in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested positive and excluded - immediately before the start of the World Athletics Championships these messages come to the accident . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de was discovered last Sunday , that is used as a m@@ asked agent for d@@ oping . &quot;
&quot; on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butter@@ fly , only 0.@@ 09 seconds missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en would have had to attend the prec@@ urs@@ ing over 50 m Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
Ch@@ en has applied the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
&quot; the National Association take the matter &quot; very serious and demands from Ch@@ en full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a communication : &quot; we will continue working with the International Sports Tribunal for CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , no longer the IOC , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio , the message moved over the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old thus went to the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; be innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be food supplements , &quot; the light is explained . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it should act in the banned substance to act the EP@@ O blood d@@ oping agent EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa was suspended provision@@ ally , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should also be positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ sow immediately entered with criticism of the athl@@ ete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not move the right words , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We Bulg@@ arians stand under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot;
&quot; thus , about all wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fter from the chronic d@@ op@@ ing@@ ed nation must not participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z had a positive impact on the an@@ ole ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on . &quot;
&quot; both den@@ ies the in@@ gest@@ ion , however , both may not start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; prior to the start of the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa is another hard blow for the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the IA@@ AF world association had the complete Russian team up to an exception because of systematic D@@ op@@ ings , also the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming pool , in addition , the earlier contracts in China had su@@ cked for violent cl@@ ashes between the athletes . &quot;
so the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympi@@ as@@ ie@@ ger Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle I will be handed over , &quot; &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in French radio . &quot;
sun was also at the heart of a meditation with the Australi@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ orton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for D@@ oping che@@ aters , &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , sun was positively tested at the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ ac@@ din in 2014 , but had to sit only a dre@@ im@@ on@@ ati@@ ge lock . &quot;
data kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de presses h@@ ack@@ ers her ran@@ s@@ om
programm@@ ers of ext@@ ortion @-@ Malware engage in targeted companies - and are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey of the malware defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes under 540 companies in North America , the UK and Germany , 40 percent of surveyed companies were at least once , partly several victims of an attack with press@@ ator software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies had already yiel@@ ding a Ran@@ som@@ ing ext@@ ortion . &quot;
40 per cent of the victims paid willing to use the charges required by perpet@@ rated systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their compres@@ sors software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attacks in corporate network attacks .
&quot; if successful , they are successful there , the potential ran@@ s@@ om is significantly higher than for private use . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware software , &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ cy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to con@@ don@@ ate advertising . &quot;
then the perpet@@ rators will be discovered for itself .
&quot; first of all , private use was the goal but the change to company att@@ acking was sc@@ ary quickly during the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once upon the computer of a victim , it is searching for un@@ long changes files like Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as to archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ ts the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustainable .
&quot; afterwards , the software presents the demands of ext@@ ortion . &quot;
&quot; to get the final turn@@ key code to the files , the victims must have money - mostly in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin - transfer . &quot;
&quot; but where private use is the personal photo database on the game , it is related to companies about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is closed . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage falls off when a ran@@ som@@ ing strikes . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the affected German firms registered sales losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had even had to interru@@ pt the business activity , in case of a fall of people in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals already were victims of attacks , whose patients can be threatened by loss of cancer . &quot;
&quot; we always say the victims : do not pay , you support only the problem , &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies have to pay their data . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the F @-@ Secure security researchers investigated the user interfaces and contact with the press@@ ors and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are indeed trying to build a kind of customer service to increase more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their victims per chat , as they can pay per Bit@@ coin , freely accessible support websites , or de@@ cryp@@ t for example files . &quot;
&quot; and will private people be saved after payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to pay hard @-@ negoti@@ ate and pay five digits to rep@@ ay their data . &quot;
&quot; in view of potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky win@@ nings from the Ran@@ som@@ ware ext@@ ortion , h@@ ack@@ ers will always share professional and share the work , explains safety experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ nie@@ wski from the Antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware roughly within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is likely that there are three or four people . &quot;
the programm@@ ers sell their damage software then in the form of a software construction to the actual ext@@ ortion .
&quot; the existing malware kits were created by making processes , advice and additional tools for one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; the scope of delivery includes a adap@@ table , allowing smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot;
the press@@ ors then search for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
&quot; so you log in one of the forums on the ground , buy the set of a det@@ ective and to install another software to install the software as possible . &quot;
payment is done per in@@ able calcul@@ ator .
&quot; typically , the crimin@@ als have the spread with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 per cent of companies responsible for the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey rely on Ran@@ som@@ y@@ ware by file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpet@@ rators already pursue new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone has no sufficient threat to successful path@@ way more , the perpet@@ rators instead of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ cy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; with this , the compensation of damage depending on the type of data is even higher than before . &quot;
&quot; also , the perpet@@ rators might be able to take new goals in the Internet of things to the grain . &quot;
&quot; at the Hack@@ er@@ Conference , def@@ aul@@ ted to demonstrate safety researchers , such as they were able to get an associated with the internet associated thermo@@ stat . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of winter , the activation of a der@@ art blocked heating so many victims could be quite a ran@@ s@@ om . &quot;
if the perpet@@ rators will then block a whole factory in the future instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a subject in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday du@@ sty .
&quot; in the little HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coupé and even the vers@@ atility of a min@@ iv@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; sounds quite reas@@ onably loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , has actually proved extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V seems rather small , passengers have a lot of space both in the first series and in the rear . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well @-@ processed and are comfortable , only the cockpit top falls down there . &quot;
versatile as comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V storage space .
&quot; it is not just a trunk of 4@@ 53 l , which is provided with a folded back@@ drop of 10@@ 26 l , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical , as it sounds : the seat areas of the rear bench let rise up like cinema arm@@ chairs and offer a storage room that is up to the ceiling of 1,@@ 24 m high . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be loaded well , but the charging height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot in 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide range of speed areas .
&quot; however , he is likely to set up a bit qui@@ eter . &quot;
the everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is another motor@@ isation : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not being offered .
the handling is balanced and a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering is likely to be a bit more direct .
the equipment can be tested in the tested top version &quot; Executive &quot; no wishes to open .
&quot; the City Emer@@ gency assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the coll@@ ision system and trace assistance systems belongs to the security systems . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , the coll@@ ision irrit@@ ated sometimes because he has rated many obstacles as &quot; coming @-@ coming objects &quot; at the rank . &quot;
the teles@@ cope works very reliable .
and the intelligent speed regul@@ ators re@@ acts on the traffic sign recognition and thr@@ ott@@ le when necessary the speed .
&quot; the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch screen , Nav@@ i , App Integration and More . &quot;
&quot; two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI @-@ jack lie below the arm@@ rest , and are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to reach . &quot;
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top diesel engines are fine .
&quot; who doesn &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 20,000 Euros , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
&quot; with HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday suit@@ ability . &quot;
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on air passenger bridge
a airline is not responsible for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
&quot; a liability may be conc@@ ei@@ vable only with dangers that are typical for air traffic , argu@@ ed the Upper Austria Regional Court ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had broken up with the fall of a knee .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life , so the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no damage to the man .
disease case : when paid by the promot@@ er
&quot; after their trip , vac@@ ation@@ ers get only money back after their trip , when the cause of the disease is desper@@ ate free in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; this is only the case , if more than ten per cent of guests inv@@ ests the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the negoti@@ ating case , a family was severely affected by diarr@@ hea and vomiting in the second day . &quot;
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their disease led the vac@@ ation@@ ers back to a defective cl@@ ay@@ ment that supposedly poll@@ inated the sea@@ water .
&quot; the family was the view , the trip was lacking - and compl@@ ained against the promot@@ er . &quot;
&quot; before the court , the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the se@@ wage plant was in fact defective . &quot;
but the promot@@ er learned only shortly before the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to go out until then that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; so he did not viol@@ ate his information , so the judgment . &quot;
especially imp@@ ur@@ ities were found in the samples of the water .
the disease of several hotel guests - bl@@ ur@@ red by infection among each other - belong to the general risk of life .
&quot; of 6@@ 91 guests , only 38 were ill . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said after the violence against refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July many people have worried about further attacks .
the state had to be sc@@ aled and decided at the same time .
&quot; certainly , our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hatred and split . &quot;
this triumph will not allow the terrorists .
&quot; when offen@@ ders had to leave the country faster , but increase the safety and strength of the population for the refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve the implementation of proposals until the German Parliament election by 2017 .
&quot; he also announced another person@@ alised rein@@ forcement of security forces , as well as in medium four @-@ digit magn@@ itude over several years . &quot;
sympath@@ y advertising for terrorism to be re@@ comp@@ uted again under punishment .
&quot; video surveillance should be improved , the ce@@ ase@@ fire is so regulated , especially the purchase of weapons in the Internet is worth . &quot;
the last far discussed silence light for physicians should remain in words after de Mai@@ zi@@ ères .
&quot; however , in dialogue with the doctors , he wants to search for solutions how the endanger@@ ing citizens could be reduced , he said with a look at the psychological cre@@ denti@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; to counter@@ act radic@@ alization of refugees , the minister maintains a better social support . &quot;
teachers have to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mat@@ ised people .
&quot; for the persecution of crimin@@ als in the special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning to investig@@ ator investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD leader Gabriel said , &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything which contributes to the security . &quot;
it is important that the Minister for the Interior announced clearly against shareholders .
&quot; this was a bro@@ ods for the sni@@ fter in the CDU / CS@@ U , Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union to a Bur@@ ka ban and the abol@@ ition of double citizenship previously .
a general prohibition of complet@@ eness he has been constitu@@ tionally un@@ problem@@ atic for constitu@@ tionally un@@ problem@@ atic .
&quot; you can &apos;t offer everything you re@@ jects , and I cut the wearing of the Bur@@ ka . &quot;
they could speak about rules about in traffic or for witnesses .
green @-@ Che@@ fin Simone Peter threw the minister to sim@@ ulate new anti @-@ terror packages and ability to sim@@ ulate action .
Left Party Leader Bernd Rie@@ x@@ inger said : &quot; fleet Pro@@ ver@@ bs and a tigh@@ tening of the right to the right to bring people in this country no more safety . &quot;
better traffic flow on the Autobahn
there is a regular basis on the revers@@ al road - here is a picture of November .
but this should change : the de@@ fle@@ ction is to be extended .
this is good news for all of the car drivers who continue in professional traffic on the ambient road every night in the jam there when they drive on the highway A@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
&quot; the road construction is extended on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer street and the exit Wes@@ eler street , the right lane to 700 metres . &quot;
motor@@ ists then drive right from the hammer on the right .
&quot; the great advantage : the traffic divi@@ des early on , whereby the total of which is improved on the multiple section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
the idea of the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
&quot; the drive train on the zu@@ br@@ inger is nervous , especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock . &quot;
&quot; week@@ days goes back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ ping track , and sometimes also beyond . &quot;
the reason is the N@@ adel@@ ö@@ hr on B 51 shortly before the Wes@@ eler street .
from here traffic only takes only one lane on the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built in front of a good three @-@ quarter years .
the reason : static calculations have shown that the bridge has no longer necessary load capacity to take up the heavy duty of heavy duty .
&quot; how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and that is associated with the connected con@@ gest@@ ion , the state service can &apos;t say . &quot;
&quot; however , to expect at age : because the bridge has an official rest period up to 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal de@@ fle@@ ur , the country operation consci@@ ously sought the traffic weaker time in school holidays because with disabilities . &quot;
the traffic will be carried out on Tuesday and wed@@ nes@@ days on Wednesday .
inter@@ cultural travel : schools for schools
the international class of Wald@@ schule visited the theater &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the Club Nim@@ a &apos;s and the boy is planning a music project now .
&quot; the Club Nim@@ a &apos;s enables young people with mig@@ rant and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster , Germany . &quot;
the &quot; class International &quot; of the Wald@@ haus &quot; Wald@@ haus has a presentation of winning the award @-@ winning unit &quot; The invisible house &quot; of the young theatre in Münster .
&quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Trip &quot; &quot; by the Club Nim@@ a &apos;s &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; , &quot; 19 students between eleven and 15 years . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association has set up the cultural integration of young people with mig@@ rat@@ ory and refugee camps to the goal of visiting schools with welcome classes , within the framework of this project cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; most of the adolescents in the class are between September 2015 and March 2016 among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and say little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographi@@ es , the s@@ zen@@ ish images and video animations , it would have been possible to follow the course of action such as the press release of the Young The@@ aters Münster . &quot;
&quot; Nim@@ a &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg , founded by Dr Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg , and the Young Theater will work in the upcoming season as part of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December the young people with and without flu@@ ent and mig@@ rant @-@ background are expected to receive training courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
&quot; offerings for children and families in the@@ atri@@ cal drama and the@@ atri@@ cal language placement , are planned . &quot;
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
&quot; given the increased refugee figures , the association reck@@ oned with many classes , who want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of star@@ ches : hope on weather repair
&quot; the weather has made the star d@@ olls @-@ gu@@ ck@@ ers in the south @-@ west Germany in the night to Friday a stri@@ ve by the bill , but there is still hope . &quot;
&quot; the night was bad because of clouds and rain that were bad for watching the heavens show , the chairman of the Stern@@ warte Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we will see many stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the shooting stars are Per@@ sians , which include the fastest ob@@ d@@ olls with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; they have their names , because they are apparently coming from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , which is in the northeast . &quot;
relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evening , one gets around for ever , at night you &apos;re awake for hours , in the morning there is no more to think of sleep . &quot;
this is all other than relaxing .
&quot; anyway , one of these problems is in good society : according to the Robert Koch Institute , roughly one quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent do not find their sleep frequent or permanent than not relaxing . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep problems ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there may be various causes based on them , emphas@@ izes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ ar , Executive Board member of the German Society for Sens@@ ors and Sle@@ ep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; but what is understand@@ able , however , is the in@@ som@@ nie , so an entry and sleep distur@@ bed . &quot;
&quot; just trying to sleep so many people as an uns@@ at@@ is@@ factory or in@@ adequate , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , board member of the German House@@ hold association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot;
what Does Sle@@ ep Dis@@ orders ?
the causes of sleep problems are complex .
&quot; are organic , psychological or behavi@@ oral factors behind it , but also medication . &quot;
not rarely is the sleeping expression of another condition .
&quot; very early awakening is often frequent in depression , &quot; says We@@ ar . &quot;
and it can be that different factors are singing .
&quot; for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc may be bad , all two up to three hours and starts bl@@ ur@@ red on all day problems and to worry about everyday problems and to worry , there is no one . &quot;
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I sleep with sleep disorders ?
&quot; who does not sleep well over a month of at least three nights a week , should be good , should go to the doctor , advis@@ es We@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; the impair@@ ment may look different : one can be beaten , tired , un@@ interru@@ pt , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , mood changes or physical complaints such as stomach or head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; in order to relie@@ ve the sleep disorder , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include behavi@@ oral changes , cogn@@ itive behavi@@ oral therapy or medications - classic sleep @-@ tablets just in exceptional case and not just for two weeks - in@@ qu@@ ire . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , he hardly emphas@@ ized Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the inter@@ disciplinary sleep centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , you should turn to sleep problems first at the home@@ ologist , advis@@ es We@@ ar . &quot;
the problem can clari@@ fy if the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who was going to sleep in sleep , and what happens ? &quot;
&quot; for example , in a sleeping laboratory , he is an example of snor@@ ing with breathing with breathing , at diseases , or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a sleep@@ y interference . &quot;
&quot; for the investigation , it is not necessary to prepare . &quot;
one should spend the day normal .
&quot; please do not make any lunch sleep , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; after the c@@ abling , one goes into bed at his normal time . &quot;
&quot; beside the electro@@ des in the body , one is wearing a nose s@@ ungl@@ asses , chest strap and an ant@@ enn@@ as on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera stands on the ceiling to sleep . &quot;
how can the problems get involved in the handle ?
&quot; there are quite a lot of pitches , which can be set for a better sleep . &quot;
&quot; We@@ ar counts on : regular sleep and standing times , not too long in bed , on the day do not sleep , do not watch TV on the clock - then you start to count immediately , and that is absolutely not eligible . &quot;
what does the jungle camp with lack of medals in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler expresses itself by Facebook to the dis@@ appointing edge of the DS@@ V @-@ Team &apos;s Olympic team .
&quot; in December 2014 , he had brought gold for the first time in Doha , making his first world record at the same time . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V athl@@ ete Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has turned the protective ex @-@ team @-@ mates in front of his criticism . &quot;
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € bonus and a jungle heads of 150,000 € no one should be surprised by lack of medals , the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the convey@@ ing system in the swimming pool is bad , the d@@ oping controls are very good . &quot;
&quot; with this , we can not compete with countries that promote a lot and even run in D@@ oping &apos;s topic , or even run it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are to be adjusted here , &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; he wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler would have to be announced nine months prior to his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Deutschland ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
exactly that way you should keep it with countries .
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to control a certain time before the World Cup / OS of independent controllers , the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A can not take part , &quot; calls for the election ham@@ burger , who now operates a ice di@@ ele . &quot;
airport : gang of luggage arrested
&quot; professional Die@@ be at Airport Düsseldorf , Germany &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , the arrest of two women and two men were working at the age of 50 to 61 . &quot;
the susp@@ ect had committed a gang of several ton@@ ers and baggage @-@ pil@@ es .
&quot; on 21.@@ 30 a.m. , civil servants recognized a gang of bonds at the airport Düsseldorf Airport , which was known for polic@@ emen from last theft . &quot;
&quot; two women and two men have committed suicide in the mid @-@ July of this year , and were gener@@ alized , working and very professional . &quot;
&quot; the specialists in the crime Com@@ miss@@ ariat 34 can prove the th@@ ie@@ ves , who had travelled for off@@ ences of offen@@ ders to Germany , four actions . &quot;
&quot; in total , they took over 15,000 euros in total . &quot;
&quot; in the first glance , the Rig@@ a@@ er Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in works on the first glance , but the police does not count towards the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; walk down the street from east to west , one comes to playing places , refresh@@ ed nursery and a bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
on the facade of a gray house someone has &quot; ug@@ ly &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; opposite a Li@@ dl , which is to be demolished soon , it is already built : by 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new apartments . &quot;
&quot; article about these &quot; trendy districts &quot; , &quot; as the responsible estate company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in calls , however , are illustrated in the last weeks with com@@ end cars . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents vac@@ ancy , on the ground floor are still spaces occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin inside en@@ cer , the police had been pronounced against the project as &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for police officers and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; on 22 June the rooms were cleared out on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , with 300 police officers , according to official statements , according to 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , locked out parts of the road and held visitors to enter the house with number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , renovated construction workers in order of unknown home@@ owners the rooms . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the evacu@@ ation was illegal , and one day later , police and construction workers departed from sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the street looks peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk before the houses in the sun , other enter@@ tain@@ ed in late late . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the house projects , elementary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens are in the immediate vicinity . &quot;
&quot; left Viol@@ ence is not the main care of many residents : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kiev since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who are here three children , are mainly gener@@ alized by police force . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the hood , they divide the concern for increasing ten@@ ds and cent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
it doesn &apos;t sound after a Kie@@ z who wanted to make a majority of police protection against v@@ and@@ als on the left .
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin Inn@@ u@@ en@@ ator and the police are up between houses and their neighbours , obviously not exists . &quot;
&quot; Friedrich@@ sha@@ in at the east of Berlin actually was a traditional labour @-@ quarter , which is also in comparison to the rest of the city a lower average income and high poverty risk . &quot;
&quot; in addition , house @-@ related projects and the native residential projects belong to the Kie@@ z : in 1990 many houses were occupied in the former German Democratic Republic , including almost the entire mainstre@@ am street near the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been held under a large police force in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district in recent years has become increasingly becoming the mag@@ nets for tourists and election liner from around the world : the inhabitants of the GDR times and former home occupied their Kie@@ z . &quot;
&quot; this has also noticeable in the r@@ ents , which has increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes it on designed discs or freshly painted fac@@ ades that were subjected to colour beut@@ ler .
&quot; this year , no other street was mentioned as often together with the words &quot; &quot; left autonomous violence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a reason for that not all neighbor as a problem , could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as body viol@@ ating is estimated almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the greatest part of the crimes are damaged , the ten@@ ds to meet the new@@ builds and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in a rental house beside the controversial 94 , cannot be given by un@@ certainty . &quot;
&quot; as regards non@@ violence , it is wei@@ ght@@ ful : people in the 94 are their neighbours , who don &apos;t have been determined . &quot;
even the famous burning cars give it directly to the Rig@@ s right no longer .
&quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal record , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps another , lives together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is aware of the Rig@@ a@@ er Street - and remained .
&quot; that is why it was so important that the residents would withdraw their road : from the police , politics and the media that are suddenly stressed the interpretation of the district in July . &quot;
&quot; however , in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer the road will continue to take away : through history of history , the old residents will push the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , the property housing , which are not interesting for many here - live here rather people who are not so well maintained , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction , I absolutely not gu@@ ed . &quot;
but what should one do if someone has never been listening ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration among all sides , also by police and residents . &quot;
&quot; K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for belonging , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z . &quot;
&quot; who passes away should be aware of this - just like someone who passes in a pub @-@ quarter , can complain that bad over noise can complain . &quot;
&quot; only presented with pre@@ text names , therefore , have asked to be called with their right name &quot;
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee meeting
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the response partners in integration and organisation .
&quot; in addition , it is a social worker . &quot;
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee convention for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
social ped@@ agog@@ ical team assi@@ sts the team in administration to Ach@@ im Gro@@ h@@ berger .
&quot; it sees itself as a response partner for all players : refugees , working group for refugees , administration , authorities , and anyone else . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine Customer from the working group indicates that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now being thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now , who has a problem above all . &quot;
so few - less mo@@ cking as much rather than rather than the number of serious responsibilities were targeted - meant when the administration wanted to write the place .
&quot; we were looking for an administrative building with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an ei@@ ving wool mil@@ dew . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not their central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le writes . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is an organization , work with people on site and behind the scenes , as well as network comfort . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been in the process for around six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent spot on three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le Ehr@@ ing and Weekly actors supports . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organis@@ ational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
new containers are soon available in the Was@@ en@@ straße
&quot; since some time , the problem has been recognized for the connection of the connection , which has been recognized . &quot;
municipal authorities are responsible for the connection .
you must accommodate refugees in their own or rented apartments .
&quot; the costs for the building , rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities itself . &quot;
the responsibility of the county seat is located on the Commun@@ e and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects but not every owner wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been designed for some time than very difficult .
de facto inv@@ ents the administration no private apartments .
&quot; it does not work so far , so you have reli@@ ed on private apartments so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the apartments must be ti@@ led , as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers will be placed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine Customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le are lon@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed stay , you are practition@@ ers , training courses , one @-@ euro jobs and aid assign@@ ments for refugees and migrants who have to be frozen or furnished . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine State . &quot;
&quot; many work in building yard or help car@@ ving , do @-@ profit @-@ profit and very neat , such as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reported . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community is to be a positive external effect .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but it does not only mean work .
&quot; the day need a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and Customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a random sense .
&quot; so you need offers , such as sport , contacts with loc@@ als and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
so there is also administration and honorary positions .
&quot; it is central , that the refugees get the feeling they were allowed in Germany and welcome . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; you need to explain the refugees that it will take time to make sense , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who sometime develop the feeling he could not work in Ur@@ bach , could not work and be un@@ profitable , he will never be able to integrate . &quot;
the significant majority is motivated .
&quot; problem cases also exists , however , say customer hon@@ estly , &quot; people where nothing goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and the customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all that is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do the two have been afraid of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client very clearly , &quot; what lack of na@@ ive might call . &quot; a residual risk can , but would not exclu@@ de them . &quot;
&quot; however , the hel@@ pers are sensitive . &quot;
these inci@@ dents may be subject to the refugees .
they are afraid that the attacks have them completely in ob@@ itu@@ res .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; so , main and honorary positions must be kept in the region , and in the region . &quot;
&quot; in the background , they have always in the background that soon a new thrust of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach . &quot;
does Germany need a upper limit ?
&quot; this question is clear to answer , shy , politics . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is un@@ fair to place them hel@@ pers . &quot;
&quot; we haven &apos;t arrived in Ur@@ bach , where we want to go , &quot; &quot; Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le says . &quot;
no new refugees that would relax .
&quot; Reg@@ ine client also makes clear that the Ur@@ b@@ acher also worked out , too , to integrate the existing humans . &quot;
&quot; these are about 100 people , mostly young men . &quot;
&quot; however , if people are in need to help them , both women are one . &quot;
&quot; political world situation is so complicated , there is no easy answers . &quot;

the f@@ ences went without success .
&quot; eventually , the unknown in fact was close to the apartment and their escape . &quot;
