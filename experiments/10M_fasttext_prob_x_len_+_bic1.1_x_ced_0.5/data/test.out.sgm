<seg id="2">"investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement TTP, both Clinton and Trump."</seg>

<seg id="4">"the differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, more philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the, about the role of the state."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Trump wants to keep the doubts in doubt, and warns that the state can damage the economy - with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to climb the economy to death, and to death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"by contrast, it would be quite different, asserting trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will return to reguliar massively, and he is strong for a reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton said to him," The state has certain tasks to open, he has opened the disadvantaged opportunities, and needs money for it. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"that's why taxes were raised to the rich," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="12">Stakeholders are both very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the needs to be invested in the press, say Trump and Clinton almost wortfully."</seg>
<seg id="14">The Democratic Candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are rejected by the state-critical Teodoro wing of the Republicans.</seg>

<seg id="17">Clearances are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal power plants and continue to drive coal targets in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil promotion is also possible to be possible in previously protected areas to terminate the Paris Climate Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"by contrast, Clinton wants to extend the renewable energies with their investment programme:" a country will create the super power of the clean energies and create millions of jobs. "" "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only in infrastructure - also with international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the tranazifish trade agreements, would not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both the USA will not want to isolate the international trade - but just protecting American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should then be paid better then, too."</seg>
<seg id="26">The present minimum wage of £7.25 be a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what trump is to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be, then he says he must not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months probably is likely to develop the tax policy of both camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on one side is Trump, who wants to pay the economy and citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics hold on him, so that the budget deficit would only get bigger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton who want to ask at least from the rich man wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of external sides"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give the hands and an official end of the eight months of war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterplayer in the gold-plated auditorium of St. Petersburg Palastes in reception, I cannot defend myself the reconciliation that Ankara wants most reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was a blow, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin smiled smile was narrowed and he shocked hard for his restrained conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">"on the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke about his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report about five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only be able to return to their old level before the crisis, but even better."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had happened so would never be something worst."</seg>
<seg id="11">"to me, his enthusiasm was obvious to indicate the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's beaming, sustainable boldness showed that the state of state of Russia had nothing to forget."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his entry: the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow from reaction to the time was wutentbrandy.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin divided and accused Ankara to fallen into the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the result was even bigger, since it was celebrated by a strange boyfriend."</seg>
<seg id="17">The vetrist rebuilding will be difficult when not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in months, the state controlled media carried out a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at once, it seemed like the Turks would bear the blame for everything."</seg>
<seg id="21">"at the serious test, the accusations of senior officials had benefited from illegal oil dealers in territories of Syria, which will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He argued this because of this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting was only taking place because Putin received the decision of Erdogan that he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a sort of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the advantages of a ceasefire lie clearly on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is needed primarily every friends who he can get lost after last month at a failed coup d'etat.</seg>
<seg id="28">"again, terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him."</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights, each year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, travel agents and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They are counting on a late seasonal attraction in the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week predicted the State television cheap fruit and vegetables, once the Turkish farm imports are allowed again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formulated it like this:" tourists there long, tomatoes here long. "</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West because of its reaction to the attempted power of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the persistent Groll on the Council of Accession of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the piping on it is to go out of cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">Russian state of state in Ankara won a bonus for a bonus that he demanded the attempted coup d "état for the elected State Organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">"for Moscow, this is well-esteemed for Moscow a self-sitting fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit meeting in this glorious palace at the seaside allowed it to Russia and Turkey, one as it once described me an analyst" "Alliance of outsides" ": two countries who dispossessed themselves away from the West and are badly treated."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nonetheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still large differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave himself the role as peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support mutual pages."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be revealing, that after almost three hours, both presidents go to the press conference, they said that they didn't even comprehend the subject."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the president of Turkey vermied it on a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no unique consensus about which a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster, as NATO member Turkey abrupt the Russian battle jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state will talk at least once again."</seg>

<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>

<seg id="23">"as it comes out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">"previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin became ex-member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Bundessibility Service (FSB), the KGB, IVANOV was appointed to his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin came to power, he called IVANOV as one of five people whom he trusted most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was assumed that IVANOV might have been President of Russia's second term in Russia, as a third term of Putin had to put Putin against the Constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this item was taken by another, leading ally Putin's allies, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>

<seg id="2">A British tour underlined his Immune System and Würgereflex for serious testing - taking place some of the most dirty and ecarrests places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk denied his course on a Euro-scarf, a railing on a piccadilly Circus, a washing head of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system under proof."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in front of each object, he used an Luminometer in order to show and show us what he will let."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "some surprising results of the light was released."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought that the rinsing pot of a train toilet is used, which has already been used by thousands of others, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright said with doctors and medical experts on promoting intestinal bacteria, as well as its own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"luckily, nothing left what he leaked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr Wright became known to test the resistance of his intestines by going through the world, and did eat strange and wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public railways to train stations to rinsing ramps of toilets, the task was definitely going to be the immune system definitely under one sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he told us:" as a child, I was relatively inworried about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and sludge water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was just a case in his reputation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the only thing he refused, was a dirty public toilet in Russia."</seg>
<seg id="14">Its promoter showed a luminometres of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the Luminometer is freshly washed-washed hands less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to snails after their Luminometric count came over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands one of less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "who shows the bacterihood in different places like the bathroom"</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film, he says," This is the worst thing I smoked in a toilet. "</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not going on here because it is insolitary here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producers of dairy products Valio. "</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company offers Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the encouragement of intestinal bacteria and immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories of Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we wanted to offer something new to the consumer. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"something that is fascinating, and simultaneously the benefits of Probiotics explains."</seg>
<seg id="25">We conducted crazy Brainstormings that ended that we said "Let us call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">Do you claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of just talk about the products, we wanted to place them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the directing of the film, added:" let me have lost my respect for Ian, if he would have relied some of the things that I have instructed him, as the disgusting Russian toilet which is shown in the movie. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things where it was easier to bring Ian to swallow them and others, with which this was pretty difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats to film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by the survey conducted in 2015, 84 percent of all respondents were associated with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent, that they may use at least occasionally products containing added lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="2">Seltsames Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the natives get nothing of the summer campaign - and the vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood them.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in 2021, the Sunday election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Swiss Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"so far as far as it does not exist: summer holidays, heat and day-war struggle - that's what you do."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the locals, who are to be convinced by the electoral fighting ones, are on holiday."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most vacationers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so may not choose the country's Day."</seg>
<seg id="8">"to this end, practical problems arise: in the holiday there are helpers which hang out posters, balloons inflating, flyers, and at the end of the vote, only fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until 4 September 2016, the electoral and final day of the day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern needs to be over close to the people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot stage, if you can say that at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU Coalition, must be afraid of office."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly in polls of the CDU."</seg>
<seg id="13">"as exciting, as strongly Neuling AfD cuts and what remains at the end of the low season."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 Prime Minister, has an almost unobtrusive election campaign, one sees its big posters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels across the country, roses roses and plauds a little with the people, like it had already been his legendary former predecessor Harald Ringstorff."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, pastering has gotten cold feet, and Chancellor Angela Merkel blaming the blame on the bloom of AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"their refugee policy, you" We create this "have accelerated the rise of populists and what is thought to cost him now."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU with its top candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced as it is, if you make a wrong time at the right place for election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited twice the German Chancellor Angela Merkel to major events; Merkel the Bundestag is in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburger and Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"since it was probably the majority of other federal states, Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently at NDR."</seg>
<seg id="22">But it too bad no man from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise the Northeastern CDU largely renounces the usual election campaign in market areas and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"that, Kokert, plays only a" minor role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Union also noted that in the country you need the basis, that it must be very strict, again to find a wire to the people."</seg>
<seg id="26">"you are just like the left, the SPD, the Green: in the times of the country hardly exist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the Council of the CDU selcomers Kokert to his fellowsoldier is also self-larvingly:" they must go there where there are wearities, where people are: Dorffeste, Golden Weddings, every birthday party must be used. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"because much in the game stands, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in the polls, S & D Group recently added 22 percent of the CDU (25) of the CDU (19) and just just before the AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">"at the election of 2011, the SPD gained clearly with 35.6 percent of the CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the green, small party with seven percent in the polls, can be done the leap into the country's day."</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue of holiday emergency and lay their election campaign on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"at the online election campaign," he calls the president of Claudia Müller. "</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise green election shockers go to local stimulants under the vacations.</seg>

<seg id="9">"since the building site moved to the south on Monday and also the lock of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was abolished and thus the connection to Rottenburg has become relaxed, the traffic situation within the place is relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="10">"now, citizens can now move from Ofterdingen from the B 27 on both sides."</seg>
<seg id="11">The traffic through the place seems to be back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were partly significant symptoms," says the vice president of the general manager of Florian King. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the residents of Bachonstraße, Steinkachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weigerrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many sleepers sought and rather than the sign."</seg>

<seg id="17">There are already two to three per minute littered.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest-speed was on the road with 77 hour kilometers in the tempo-30 zone.</seg>

<seg id="20">"for the business people at the B 27, it is only a small solace that is now open to customers from Rottenburg."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the cards, business professionals don't like to look."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, that the B 27 redevelopment of them has led to them for sales in revenues, everyone is asking you to see."</seg>

<seg id="36">"instead, President Jörg Schmidt, on a request by Göhner, is whether there would be a financial compensation, with reference to the benefits of the situation at the B 27. now she has to put the disadvantages of the benefits offered by the restoration."</seg>

<seg id="15">The reputation after more video surveillance and staff for security agencies are also not surprising.</seg>

<seg id="21">"refugees that are fetched specifically to the country, should notify their smartphone and make Social Media accounts for a security check before."</seg>
<seg id="22">"at Dulce for past asylum seekers, he wants to face some more worse than so far - such as those who commit crimes or their papers consciously throw away their identity."</seg>
<seg id="23">"a lot of it is politically, legally holy."</seg>
<seg id="24">Manches works even unequipores and lets questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with some points - in the inequality treatment of Gedulfed for example - the question arises: what does it mean to do with safety and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, say de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, it is not possible to address the attacks of Ansbach and Würzburg refugees."</seg>
<seg id="28">Many people were worried about security in view of the high refugee camps.</seg>
<seg id="29">"and things, who are deeply involved in men, did not let them cling in election campaign."</seg>

<seg id="37">"only a gardener controversy over the equipment of the federal police, then on a safety-political ideas collection of some labour-interior ministers, in which the resortchefs also demand a Burka prohibition and a return from double citizenship."</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière is tired also here to reconcile tones.</seg>

<seg id="40">We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.</seg>

<seg id="3">"before going to the comment, in order to oversaw him under the pseudonym non-aging defect-aged men with rinsane insults, this statement depends on current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the revival of records are not attributable to a boom in millennials, who want to welcome the unity of physical objects, but to the Midlife-nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased a record are all the forecast for the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely harvesting group."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by hobbyers - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers keep their feelings rather to spend (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results agree on YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on television, I would follow the camera while in the midst of a busy road in Soho, a modest hoist suit, before I keep standing, my hands hold and something determinant like:" so, let's throw a little look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let's throw a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart of SoHos is slow to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the building where once an independent seller, there is still a handful fantastic record specialist."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the camera memory to turn the camera for the next part, in which I stand up to various men in such shops and try to appreciate their age and mind by observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I of Sister Ray (Data Number: two young women, three men mean age) into Reckless Records (Data Number: eight men middle age, one woman, probably around the 20) sequence, is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already guess," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4.000 records."</seg>
<seg id="17">"this record plates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I'm not followed by him), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: it is now able to buy records that he could not afford to buy stuff, which he sold when he was young and pledged."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late 1960s, early 70s, which appeared, when I was 11 or 12. things, when I was probably a little too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"it is true that those who buy records are rather introverted and would like to spend a time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my aster.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Wez, 25 who works with Sister Ray, believe that many customers that he meets the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also notices a new wave of people who have influenced by the media, people who have heard about comeback and to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"of the conversations that I have led, people usually have been credited to their collection in 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom to the record of a certain age of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a shop such as phonica to realize that record shops offers a soothing community of equiners.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers accepted the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">Some plate fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw the stability of confidential record sleeves as well as happy itgenhings.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or property of material possessions than any kind of comfort," says Wez. "</seg>
<seg id="32">This is with me as collectors and I think it is so many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal with.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social worker!" "a staff from a plate stack."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month, have not heard them yet."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the poll found out that 41% have a turntable that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, don't have turntables."</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned while I by a stack of Bossa Nova Comracer bläter.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (Data Number: three men mean age), has noticed a" trophy "of the Revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just arrived here and said," I have no turntables, but I would like to buy a radio record that I can put them into the shelf, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a great percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productive, less musicians."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a turntable."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not elderly, which come only slowly."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has dedicated the sound plate almost a whole floor, has an underlining audience when I clean."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teagejure and women aged middle ages."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above shops - Wild Beasts neuester synthesizer- and Exhauled Pop instead of experimental jazz dryans from speakers - is it good to see such diversities of the customer.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks especially lonely, but brand psychic traumas are badly detectable, if one stands next for about 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, runs around for some minutes in the business and considers the variation of the plates for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">You do rather need a mannester bumblebee as a big buy.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it doesn't deserve much, so collecting records no real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it's easy to listen to music from a computer or any way, but the beauty of records is..." "they drives with a loved sigh."</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record owners: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I admit the licence, I watch the jeans hotelpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who move himself for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a Crosley turntable."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of novels, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody looks like it - perhaps because they are only decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to put them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that every attraction for these items can mean more money for the industry and to send some customers to the depths SoHos for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, even the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my reresearches revealed that the results of YouGov vote, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record owners exist in reality, record shops and Onlineforen."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the bumblebees by turnaround in the Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they master the rigid view of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator who rises over the shoulders of nothing bitter-aged men."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7-er rugby came in the final on Thursday evening to a rusty stop at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were struck with a result of 43-7 in the Deax Stadium in Rio."</seg>

<seg id="9">"eight years ago, she lost with Ryan every game in Adelaide Sevens."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Ursel Kipp has already accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teaching staff she took the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sing in an elderly choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"sing me - emotional and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, joyful and a total of living, says she."</seg>
<seg id="5">"at the same time, she does something good for her health and spirit."</seg>
<seg id="6">"for Singen is like a great hobby for seniors, Erhard Hackler says of the German senior League."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most senior citizens sing in the choir and share the joy of music, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">Through the regular meeting you can connect social contacts and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">"for frequently, social and family structures often dissolve, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "to discuss and organise themselves to the others, and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of se."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the positive sense, Hackler believes."</seg>
<seg id="12">"because, senior citizens train a deep and controlled breathing."</seg>
<seg id="13">"he who calls his lungs regularly, also not so fast in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even though it comes to get the sound of the voice at age, singing is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"for older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the German labor community of the senior citizens."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations, the joint singing was worth a much higher job, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and leisure, explains them."</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observed that singing or hearing of songs are often wakes up with older people many memories often associated with positive feelings of their youth time.</seg>
<seg id="18">"through Liedtexte and particularly melodies, people themselves demise themselves for long-lying events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"when singing the head, a special achievement is required, Lenz explained."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, focusing on their own voice and to focus on a specified rhythm, and to watch the other haters - this is a major cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"just older people living alone, do not only practise themselves on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition, which one finds through the singing in chorus, Hackler writes."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem is also growing by singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show yourself: if I do long for something, I will get better and alert about me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start with singing, there's enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"who wants to try a new hobby, should not hesitate - even if he believes not to have little talent."</seg>
<seg id="28">"they are not singing alone - with 50 sinful people, who sounds there if there is a tone beside it?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"in search of the appropriate offer, seniors are different options, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"someone sings among the acquaintances in an elderly, one can easily connect."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews over choirs in the surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="32">"who would like to sing in a church choir, can turn directly to the church or the church."</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior citizens can also be found via the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"anyone who has no access to the Internet, can ask the family, friends or neighbours with the help of the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="35">"those who want to sing too, should be connected to a choir, advises Hackler."</seg>

<seg id="4">"it is, as the Olympic torch itself would be a burning rod, who will protect from the bracelets for the swimmers on the trimmer."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can not listen to the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's waiting long in the coffeshop, without using Simone Biles, Katie Lecovery or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there are Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women of women with dimples, would have been fully submitted to this known name that would be sent to Prime Time, when he would be a swimmers, Turner or even Freal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fighting for gold in the Olympic trampolines."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame is not illuminated every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partly in the shadow, sports that are not generally accepted: air guns, archery, badminton, taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swimming and may reign too long.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I have modest arguments on my specific favorites, then let me get attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampolines have already been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was the last 16 years that many people knew that I didn't know that there is a Olympic portable at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">That could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes to match, it never won a medal in the trampoline jump and had an athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round."</seg>

<seg id="17">"for Dong Dong, Dong Dong, China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal in London this year."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline jumping has a certain outer fish, partly because it sounds for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschool as those that sounds for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I'm not an expert, but only a happy enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never to end - but also the grazie of the gym and diving that combines two sports that are essentially united.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" trampoline "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means something like" jumping board. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"jumping winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and must have a number of falling movements (turning, real and salad) before they land at the feet."</seg>

<seg id="24">"two-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallists hoped in their quest for gold, faster, up and down, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes go back, down and down on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall, but also in the television transmission another higher target: the world or the Olympic-ords."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the targeted Streets is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to stir even a viewer's tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I even feel when watching this games as a somewhat tired.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a atropause.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampolinspringer is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A downward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she pruned, seemingly heavier like an astronaut, goes to the top, then down again, then effortlessly."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a competition, of course not without difficulty but during the practice there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves enter into the distance, only the tolerumerical, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protest in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">"protesters, who demand political changes in Ethiopia, struggled in violent resistance."</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that they were killed by protests during clashes with police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Ethiopia has just been working together?</seg>
<seg id="6">"over the last ten years, it was one of the most stable in Africa, a solid consortium of Western Europe with a fast-growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in the past few months, protests against the government struggled against the country, reaching out more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed down the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The response of the government was unmerciful according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses said that policemen were shot unarmed demonstrators and killed armed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation videos on protests, which are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security professionals are fighting with sticks, while they were forced to make a hand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The chief of the UN authority for human rights demands an ongoing investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to cooperate with this country and will even become more difficult," "Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group."</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated from the west.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror over the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, especially in Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expanded in considerable tempo.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new Pendanger train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">"roads are generally quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was everything else as an example for democracy - human rights organisations have continued the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, whereby dissidents were effective for silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile, or put into prison, or cast into the desert of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and don't have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopian."</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous problems that cover everything from the land use to worms in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a widespread election last year, the ruling party and its allies gain the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, stresses along the border with Eritrea; a battle for this zacky, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front, or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who were more or less forced to share the turbulence and could be armed."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of debiting after years ago are exploding in the surface under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smart phones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, since cheap smartphones were increasingly more frequent and improved by Internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government does access to Facebook and Twitter what they are in regular intervals, especially at protests, so many people can still communicate via Internet proxies, which hide it, wherever they stop."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians said they were gathered to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two biggest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since Äons prospered the Amharas, who come from Aeolian mainly Christian highlands, in politics and economy, while they are the Oromos, of which many Muslims are living and live in flat areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are going to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominant unfair by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military service in the trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death in an unpolluted disease in the year 2012, 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was considered tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly amused to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and special contractors to edit opponents and to make them harmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is lacking in this fundamental skill," Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen from relatively unattended reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopian Mountains, comes from Hailemariam from the South."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he enjoys not the confidence of the security services provided by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many feared that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia had such an uproar in 2005, after thousands of elections protested, according to analysts, apparently by the government, they were apparently stolen by the government."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following Razicia, many protesters were killed, even if it were less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts derided Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, as well as the new Pendanger, as well as its measurable progress in poverty control."</seg>
<seg id="53">But apparently this is not the intention of intensification of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month's protesters in Gondar, an amharic city, by Tigray run business and hatred toward the Tigray is increasingly used in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that protests in the United States and other Western allies bring into an independent position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenduring over the neighboring Somalia, even if they recently announced that she has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he doesn't want to crumble its ally in a already volatile area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin free migration."</seg>

<seg id="3">This clarification fell on new questions about the Presidential candidate of the Presidential candidate of the Republicans if he was able to communicate and understandable with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings his fellowsoldier, who strive to take him during an eventful phase of protection, to explain in the peculiar position, which he could not have meant."</seg>
<seg id="5">"after he had made the suggestion at a campaign event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump on Wednesday had restrained and insisted on interviews that he really did not intend to signify the President and Mrs. Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning, Mr. Trump told Mr. Trump, he was simply sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the tweet was contrary to the previous day, Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the accusation completely seriously."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative Radiomator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help the statement something weakened by reminded him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the republican Presidential candidate does not want to know about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the last storm of critique came down to Mr. Trump, while he tries to draw the focus of its campaign because of falling conversion to economic situation."</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches to the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">"on Friday, Mr. Trump was trying to return to this subject again."</seg>
<seg id="12">On Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals will lead to higher taxes and that he was boring by their speech.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he drew strong criticism for himself when he said, the Russians should chop the Russians about Clinton, but explained later" "Of course, I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic limits to politics and then return to ruders.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken from his fans, as they arrive, and then, if necessary," "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who watches the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his testimony, so they can be interpreted in various ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of sharpening the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted an additional sound, since its reversed values have continued to go back."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, published on Friday, showed a lead with a large lead in the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-in-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump is generally trying to appoint out for its provocative statements, he is accused of misunderstanding his critics or misunderstanding his humour."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he is strengthened in focus of attention in the last months of its presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps jokes have brought his loyal rihites into the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provokant might be his statements."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps prominent intercessors, gave himself great effort to defend candidates today in a CNN interview from Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I think what he says are legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was questioned about Mr. Trumps's correctness, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense, that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it backbone, completely false and therefore it was because he drew the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream republicans try to argue that the government served as Foreign Minister, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister, ISIS is allowed to spread out the situation in the Middle East aggressive."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump was continuing his attacks on the media and threw them before, on each of his words and voiced against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he defied the" poor, miserable, "TV experts who try to understand him and said," "You can't do it!" "</seg>

<seg id="9">"their latest collaboration," A decent meal, "which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>

<seg id="11">"brick, 54, ordered a Frischlinge, withdrew olive trees while Coe, 57, Truthahn with potato purée and vegetable."</seg>
<seg id="12">"when the reporter ordered Hackers, this pair was fitting for a discussion about the food in the era of the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," Ziegelman said. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"there were peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were made up of an ingredient and some cheap that the ingredient is stretched.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">COe smiled.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it has to have laid down in the stomach like lead," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="19">"during the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-you-Can-Eat buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"teams of women coaches for male Fellow and it was freshly baked pastures for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Americans, who, during the first World War, were sent to starving Europeans." a Square Meal "draws the way to which the country went with it, not to be the Schlaraffenland."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time in the food for the Americans, a central, split theme was," allied Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new budgeted food was just as tense: mysterious food like breads and chattacking have been recharged as" wonderful way, food waste, realizing, because bait could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creative sauce. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by low-cost dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the focal point of the American kitchen, became a rare luxury for years."</seg>
<seg id="26">"unique mixtures were tried, as a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction of satisfaction before taste or even healthy food was understood."</seg>
<seg id="27">"during their research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it wasn't a favorite addition to the lunch," says Coe. "</seg>

<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions are not fit to each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the household items.</seg>
<seg id="32">"as never before or ever, household appliances - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the country's eating habits."</seg>
<seg id="33">"confusing recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become" household spolitives "and the challenge, Pampe as cremige spaghetti with carrots in delicious meals to be justified."</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal, is a celebration of historic treat."</seg>
<seg id="35">"in particular, the reports on the response from the government are starving to starvation citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover Lass-me-cake-food-attitude."</seg>
<seg id="36">"while he publicly praised the simple Iowa farms in his kitchen, he speists like the millionth heavy man of the world to which he has become."</seg>

<seg id="38">He ate in a almost gilded dining room and wore a tux.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was a great success.</seg>
<seg id="40">"President Roosevelt had perhaps committed the same mistake, if not his wife Eleanor would have asked him to statute a stamp with his stomach."</seg>
<seg id="41">"as described in the book, announcing a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Ms. Roosevelt said that the White House brought the boring food in Washington, but also one of the most controversial."</seg>
<seg id="42">"many of the species from the era of Great Depression, to deal with food, was rejected when the country came back on the legs."</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenlandhai: the oldest cyclone is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenlandhaie usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This hai was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">"he was born in 1624, and floats with a 1 km / h in the North Atlantic - until today."</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland's get up with 150 years of young offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"on the bottom of the North Atlantic, Greenland is located on average at 1,220 meters far in an hour."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it comes to it, the five-metre animal accelerates at a satte 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Robbe."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this lifestyle, however, seems to be a bullet concept for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen, from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report on the journal" Science "in any case of a Greenland, which could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented on Alexander Scheme from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock, this lifespan, which means a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in fact, the Evolutionary biologist suspected that Greenland-haie become rocky."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only failed the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenlandhaie are difficult to observe, finally they live mainly in the Ice Sea off the thin populated coast of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they are water-temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface usually in the winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland-haie.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their time-bends left them when they took six animals with a broadcaster in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, these sharks make this sharks still: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another one had swallowed up a young kingfisher."</seg>
<seg id="19">"maybe they hunt, sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice cream and are looking for cadets, which are torily from higher water layers."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland-haie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 cm long, during the biggest 502-centimeter."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of animals, they analyzed the lens core of the sharks with the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the eye lens is born before the birth of the sharks, which contained in the proteins, will not be renewed later."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">"their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when atomic tests attempts to tow larger quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"at 220 centimeters in length, the lens core contained a low excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapon, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday at its investigation in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in its lens core, all larger Greenland-sharks had a normal carbon-14 amounts due to cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493-centimetre-long Greenlandhai showed a age of 335 years, while the record-shark with 502 centimeters could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to arrange an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and at the age of 156, Greenland's sharks with the multiplication has become at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is likely to be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live particularly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the old record holder, a 211 year old Grönlandwal, put on the neck of a 120-year old harpoon top, was caught in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to low temperatures often, the organism of living animals live in asynx."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature then - and lows slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in cold water, animals are often very large."</seg>
<seg id="38">"the volume is growing much faster than its surface, through which the animal does heat heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">"therefore, the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much bigger than at one gram of elephant."</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"thus, a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on it, as possible as many descendants," explains the evolutionary biologist shaft. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"a very big beast, however, should invest more in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably inhabitable."</seg>
<seg id="3">"at Goddard Institute for Space Studies, NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms, similar to those of climate research."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere once had been observed in similar conditions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously noted that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, drowned atmosphere, and nevertheless slowly turned on."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably proved more dry places than de Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protected from faster evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the early Venus also benefited from a sun, which was 30 percent."</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow revolution of Venus exponated its day side of the Sun for almost two months," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this is warmed the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds that affects the surface of a large part of the solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the result are average temperatures, which are a few degrees cooler than that of the Earth today."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the model brought forth a story of Venus, which resembles evolution that was suspected earlier by Planets."</seg>
<seg id="14">"although they probably inhabitable, Venus had been exposed to a lot of heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned down by the ultraviolet light.</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers of extortion-Malware engage in targeted companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey of the malware defense specialists Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies were at least once, partly several victims of an attack with pressator software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 percent of companies had already yielding a Ransoming extortion."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims paid willing to use the charges required by perpetrated systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their compressors software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to attacks in corporate network attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"if successful, they are successful there, the potential ransom is significantly higher than for private use."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware software," says Malwarebytes-chief Marcin Kleccynski in conversation with the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the Malwareprograms were still designed to condonate advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators will be discovered for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">"first of all, private use was the goal but the change to company attacking was scary quickly during the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once upon the computer of a victim, it is searching for unlong changes files like Word-, Excel- or database files as well as to archives of images and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the Ransomware and deletes the originals sustainable.</seg>
<seg id="14">"afterwards, the software presents the demands of extortion."</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the final turnkey code to the files, the victims must have money - mostly in the form of Cryptocurrency Bitcoin - transfer."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where private use is the personal photo database on the game, it is related to companies about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is closed."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage falls off when a ransoming strikes."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the affected German firms registered sales losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent had even had to interrupt the business activity, in case of a fall of people in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals already were victims of attacks, whose patients can be threatened by loss of cancer."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say the victims: do not pay, you support only the problem," says Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of companies have to pay their data."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the F-Secure security researchers investigated the user interfaces and contact with the pressors and come to the result: the perpetrators are indeed trying to build a kind of customer service to increase more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their victims per chat, as they can pay per Bitcoin, freely accessible support websites, or decrypt for example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and will private people be saved after payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to pay hard-negotiate and pay five digits to repay their data."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in view of potentially high and relatively risky winnings from the Ransomware extortion, hackers will always share professional and share the work, explains safety experts Chester Wisniewski from the Antivirus provider SOPHOS:" a single person can write a ransomware roughly within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is likely that there are three or four people."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their damage software then in the form of a software construction to the actual extortion.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the existing malware kits were created by making processes, advice and additional tools for one-time, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery includes a adaptable, allowing smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The pressors then search for further hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">"so you log in one of the forums on the ground, buy the set of a detective and to install another software to install the software as possible."</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is done per inable calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"typically, the criminals have the spread with the spread," explains Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 per cent of companies responsible for the Malwarebytes survey rely on Ransomyware by file-back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators already pursue new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone has no sufficient threat to successful pathway more, the perpetrators instead of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," explains Malwarebytes-chief Marcin Kleccynski. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"with this, the compensation of damage depending on the type of data is even higher than before."</seg>
<seg id="42">"also, the perpetrators might be able to take new goals in the Internet of things to the grain."</seg>
<seg id="43">"at the HackerConference, defaulted to demonstrate safety researchers, such as they were able to get an associated with the internet associated thermostat."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in the middle of winter, the activation of a derart blocked heating so many victims could be quite a ransom."</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators will then block a whole factory in the future instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also be a subject in Industry 4.0. "</seg>

<seg id="15">"for example, who has a herniated disc may be bad, all two up to three hours and starts blurred on all day problems and to worry about everyday problems and to worry, there is no one."</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I sleep with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">"who does not sleep well over a month of at least three nights a week, should be good, should go to the doctor, advises Wear."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment may look different: one can be beaten, tired, uninterrupt, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, mood changes or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches."</seg>

<seg id="25">"who was going to sleep in sleep, and what happens?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for example, in a sleeping laboratory, he is an example of snoring with breathing with breathing, at diseases, or if you don't find the cause of a sleepy interference."</seg>
<seg id="27">"for the investigation, it is not necessary to prepare."</seg>
<seg id="28">One should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"please do not make any lunch sleep," says Fietze. "</seg>

<seg id="40">So there is also administration and honorary positions.</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central, that the refugees get the feeling they were allowed in Germany and welcome."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"you need to explain the refugees that it will take time to make sense, for example with language courses."</seg>

<seg id="47">All that is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do the two have been afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine client very clearly, "what lack of naive might call." a residual risk can, but would not exclude them. "</seg>
<seg id="50">"however, the helpers are sensitive."</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents may be subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They are afraid that the attacks have them completely in obitures.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"so, main and honorary positions must be kept in the region, and in the region."</seg>
<seg id="56">"in the background, they have always in the background that soon a new thrust of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach."</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">"this question is clear to answer, shy, politics."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to place them helpers."</seg>
<seg id="60">"we haven't arrived in Urbach, where we want to go," "Annika Deuschle says."</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees that would relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">"Regine client also makes clear that the Urbacher also worked out, too, to integrate the existing humans."</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are about 100 people, mostly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"however, if people are in need to help them, both women are one."</seg>
<seg id="65">"political world situation is so complicated, there is no easy answers."</seg>
