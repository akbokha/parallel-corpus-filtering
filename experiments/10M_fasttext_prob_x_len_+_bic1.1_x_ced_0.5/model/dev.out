Obama receives Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not so friendly .
&quot; the two wanted to implement the international agreement and on Tehran , dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ ated measures in the Middle East speak . &quot;
&quot; with the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been w@@ ager for many years .
&quot; Washington has critic@@ ised Israel &apos;s constant capital expenditure , and Netanyahu has back@@ wards the will of peace in the peace process . &quot;
&quot; by Obama the deal struck by Obama on the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two continued wor@@ sen@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in March , Netanyahu , the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in front of the US Congress , had given a cont@@ enti@@ ous speech as Aff@@ ti@@ r@@ ont to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken by Obama , a meeting had denied this with regard to the upcoming election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in a emergency call , Professor to have shot his friend . &quot;
&quot; in a emergency call Professor Sh@@ annon Sullivan , with a slightly cont@@ enti@@ ous voice of the police , said that he had shot his friend and that his servants had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; lamb had been very important to emphas@@ ize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house the officials found the dead bodies given by Amy Pr@@ un@@ iss and a handwritten note that was on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I could go back , I loved Amy and she is the only woman that ever loved me . &quot; this was signed according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication to that lamb , who traveled in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , where he was able to set up 300 miles to the school grounds , where he was shot and killed at the door with his office , E@@ than Schmidt . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ gn@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that all our staff members have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
&quot; for example , he said that lamb had the disast@@ rous recall after this . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took the life , when the police attacked him . &quot;
&quot; a day after shooting at the university , the students and lec@@ turers resort to hide behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to obtain a picture of what Lamb is motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the explore at the two ends of the state , like what students and employees who knew him , helped to make a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
&quot; students said that they are looking forward to his teaching . &quot;
&quot; the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ un@@ iss died , he said he had no story of violence or criminal record . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself mentioned a book written in a written book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he gave up his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both trained in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teaching staff includes 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some incl@@ ines to problem@@ atic behavi@@ ours .
&quot; a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ aver , who had picked lamb , said that he seemed too excited and nervous , &quot; as if anything was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he had told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for a assessment of health reasons , saying that he has just been able to have any health problem . &quot;
this year he was only holding two online courses .
&quot; latest changes in the University &apos;s employment policy outlined what the promotion , for the lamb had worked so hard for the lamb had no guarantee for an automatic route to an establishment as Assistant Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know about a conflict between lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s conception . &quot;
&quot; these are questions , which can &apos;t answer the Lamb anymore . &quot;
&quot; after the flight from the campus , the police later place Lam@@ bs Trail , when he returned to Mississippi of Arkan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , one slew a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back yard of a home approximately one mile south of its home @-@ house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was going to run in the entry .
&quot; it was not clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said they knew he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; Genesis began his work at the university , which 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and underwent ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he made his doctorate in ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long @-@ lived friends of Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la Hair@@ ston said , she was 15 and he was 20 when they met some friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy , who tried some years to teach her guitar game . &quot;
&quot; at that time , he was the s@@ warm of women . &quot;
&quot; all girls melted away when he was there , &quot; said hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Bran@@ don . &quot;
&quot; jum@@ pers and Pr@@ un@@ iss were together , at present , some time . &quot;
&quot; in the emergency call , &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there were no certificates of a marriage . &quot;
had a dog named Light@@ ning who was living with them in the Back@@ stein @-@ House that ad@@ joining a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police told that the dog was in order .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ un@@ iss , Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; it was totally destroyed by the bottom , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolute best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met lamb , but because of his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that lamb were interested in music and playing blues . &quot;
lamb met Pr@@ zi@@ iss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail found two years ago in a summer fair .
later they played together the one or other gig .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writing , singing their own music . &quot;
Pr@@ ab@@ uses was a nurse that worked for different companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender and sometimes entertainment Coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ cle@@ p Room , a weak illuminated bar near G@@ auti@@ er , said that he saw lamb and Pr@@ un@@ iss Night in the night of 5th September for the last time , after lamb had ended his guitar and harmon@@ ic@@ ism finished before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no signs that anything was wrong .
&quot; he just said a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were sitting on the premises and they were jo@@ king .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ ester .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , headed the first semester program and speci@@ alizes in American citizens living and colonial history , &quot; said Don Allan Mitchell , a English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas and was president of his Brotherhood and the Student &apos;s Committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta @-@ campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening . including lecturer , employees , students and members of the community on a candle @-@ commem@@ oration . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ mid@@ ts wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt participated too at the vig@@ il , while the Univers@@ al@@ or &quot; B@@ right Morning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot; &quot;
the lessons are resumed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland and Mississippi .
&quot; Associated Press Manager Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story was corrected to reflect that the police had shot his emergency , after he had shot to Schmidt , and that lamb had shot in his emergency call Pr@@ ab@@ iss already known as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever been married . &quot;

Michael J. Fox is thinking about his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
she was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat at the theater to the Roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat is next to me , and it became clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for the upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film starts , and it comes to me in mind that I am a sim@@ ulated sem@@ ap@@ points and an arm length of it , with the prin@@ cess of Wales at a date . &quot;

&quot; it really is for me , &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; wrong the biggest time @-@ travel film ever filmed . &quot;

UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; ban Ki @-@ moon says , &quot; &quot; His respon@@ ding to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; for almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only be wor@@ sen for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN boss re@@ jects all parties including the shared UN security Council , unite to unite and encourage mutual negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent member states of the Council , USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France , on the outskirts of the General Assembly meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he regre@@ t@@ ted that subsequent alter@@ ations in the Council and the regional powers can make this situation in@@ sol@@ vable within the Syrian people and the regional powers .
&quot; ban has called for the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity when managing the crisis in Syria , demonstr@@ ating a nuclear deal with Iran at the time of achieving a nuclear deal . &quot;
8 Cir@@ cum@@ c@@ aries mean that Corpor@@ ations Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some people tried to brand him as a flop .
some people did it as a joke .
and some of them waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how many rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to pull with Donald Tr@@ ump from the top speeds under the p@@ olls , it hasn &apos;t worked out ( still ) . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven pointed p@@ olls , Donald Tr@@ ump showed lead in two @-@ digit range and some begin to ask ones@@ elf for the chances of presenting the nomin@@ ation of the real estate business . &quot;
&quot; of course , it &apos;s too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the republi@@ can nomin@@ ation .
experts acknowledge that Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was given to the rising tide of Herman Cain at that time in 2011 and none of them won a state in the nomin@@ ation process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
&quot; but outside side groups like Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super P@@ AC and the conservative business group Club for Growth attributed Tr@@ um@@ ps , which now begin to drop their dollar in order to drop him down . &quot;
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary stage :
tr@@ um@@ ps popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ ature in mid @-@ June , a pol@@ l of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University revealed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate business Mog@@ ul . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
in the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
&quot; now six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view from Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures keep in the early States .
&quot; a fifth week , a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Io@@ wa announced that 60 percent of the Republi@@ can have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump . &quot;
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P voters GO@@ P would be happy to be successful as candidates .
&quot; in a CNN / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they would either be &quot; thr@@ illed &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two out of 10 , they would be &quot; sc@@ and@@ alized &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son produces about the same enthusiasm of as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent saying they were &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) . &quot;
the next in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they would be &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; disp@@ leased , &quot; if everyone Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans sees tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and ins@@ ulting statements , 52 percent of voters think that real estate Mog@@ ul had the right temper@@ ament for an president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number holds in the first preliminary state of the nation , the state of Io@@ wa , where the same 52 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a Commander in Chief , according to the Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to execute his position effectively , and in almost six out of 10 will say that his temper@@ ament is not in the White House p@@ asse , so ABC / post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; when they place their care@@ ers , republi@@ can elec@@ ts Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P @-@ nomin@@ ation , they say after a pol@@ l of CNN / OR@@ C from the past week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
&quot; that is a change since the time , when four out of July their money put money to Je@@ b Bush . &quot;
complete dis@@ closure : GO@@ P voters had not the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this time in the final cycle , four out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nomin@@ ation , just 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it shows that a large variety of GO@@ P voters are turning the Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign as pl@@ au@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gather around another candidate , Tr@@ ump happened almost everybody . &quot;
&quot; some experts refer to that the frag@@ ile field probably contributes to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , whereas the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed across more than a dozen of other candidates . &quot;
but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September showed that a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates re@@ iter@@ ates the multi @-@ media support .
&quot; he made 1 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , ahead of Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally ahead of margin Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Chris Christie . &quot;
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who hits him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ at @-@ head race .
a Scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ Fans says she had formed her mind .
a new pol@@ l of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters that support Tr@@ ump will say they strongly affir@@ med their voices .
&quot; of course , much has happened to change that , and no one can really say , never to change the mind . &quot;
46 percent said they leave the door open to altern@@ ate with other candidates .
&quot; yet Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competition in the out@@ si@@ der of the other out@@ si@@ ders , neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but elec@@ tors who say they have formed their opinion , are twice as often for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they were to agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration . &quot;
&quot; ever since , Donald Tr@@ ump has since called &quot; R@@ ape &quot; in his election campaign , the Immig@@ ration and Angel@@ s in the public dis@@ course was elected in 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump @-@ Hisp@@ ano @-@ Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can party and will damage the revival efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / post survey of Monday , six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with tr@@ ump in questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as immigration remains in the spot@@ light , Donald Tr@@ ump shall also seem to do so . &quot;
the fru@@ stration for the government climbed to new high@@ s .
&quot; in the meantime , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son now cat@@ ches the support of Republi@@ can elec@@ tors , mainly through its out@@ si@@ der status . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Monday @-@ German survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ der than anyone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry with Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines register / Bloomberg in Io@@ wa over two weeks ago that three of four Io@@ wa Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans at Congress ; with 54 percent un@@ happy &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ ken@@ weg path there is the most expensive flat @-@ residence - overlooking the North Sea coast .
&quot; in the street , a square meter roof apartment is 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer to objects is naturally limited , meaning that in the study , thus the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which particular layers are one square meter most .
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student country in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; unlike the top residential areas , one of the price comes before such as Pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
&quot; the real estate provider Angel@@ s &amp; Eth@@ ers published a ranking of the most exclusive German sites - with square met@@ ers@@ bies in dizz@@ ying heights . &quot;
&quot; there are several ten@@ ths of Euros ni@@ x - per square meters , well noted . &quot;
but good for those who can afford ...
&quot; Inci@@ dentally , Munich is not an exception here at the top . &quot;
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
a double go@@ al@@ keeper in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ star Thomas Müller simply has a run .
&quot; a successful hit by Thomas Müller , the way to a well earned 3 : 0 at the Viv@@ ak@@ os Pi@@ raeus , was successful . &quot;
a convincing start of the Champions League season .
&quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario go@@ ze have dealt a dream start into the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; on Bayern , Bayern . &quot;
the team of train@@ ers P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola has won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek Record Champion St@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Mul@@ ler double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Divine 1 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth stage in series aims to be the first step towards the final on May 28th , 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to get the grand@@ sco@@ re@@ way to Munich . &quot;
&quot; with his 28 hits in the Champions League , the Bavarian leadership of the Olymp@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ ro@@ bin Roberto , who made a flan@@ k shot fired at the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate that , &quot; the Bavarian Captain Philipp L@@ ame promised in front of the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 , and the Münchner Oktober@@ fest . &quot;
&quot; they showed a concentrated , dedicated idea , without fl@@ ashing . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ raeus had gained his latest six hom@@ eg@@ s in the Royal class , including prestigious clubs as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled here . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria , divided into seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , would not want to be the next sacrifice . &quot;
&quot; they were brave , in their vig@@ orous efforts , but often encouraging works . &quot;
the attacks were led to often by the lower left in Lin@@ ks@@ on Douglas Costa when Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i was rare against the former Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
m@@ iller had no luck left when his flan@@ k came from the right half board in the left upper To@@ re@@ ck .
&quot; during the 6@@ 7th minute , the world champion made the possible 2 : 0 . &quot;
the best occasions in half one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
&quot; first of all , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storms ideology Brown was hit the head ball of Poland by the line ( 26 ) . &quot;
&quot; then with direct turn off , the go@@ al@@ keeper escaped to the knee ( 3@@ 5. ) . &quot;
&quot; even though the Bav@@ arians had a residence , it was able to set up Pi@@ raeus N@@ adel@@ che . &quot;
but Manuel Neu@@ er was a decree on the door@@ ke@@ epers .
&quot; for instance , when he was writing a d@@ ash of ide@@ ye on the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
&quot; before he left Gu@@ ardi@@ ola a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who did it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario go@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the Ka@@ der , was sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup team gave the green light only after the final training , &quot; &quot; Senior Chief Matthias Sam@@ mer said &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; : &quot; if you want to do something other from it , this is quite v@@ icious . &quot;
&quot; also during the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the cast Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , per El@@ f@@ ond Müller made one better . &quot;
it was in the stadium to be rock@@ ed in the stadium .
&quot; after a smaller group of sometimes avoided Bavarian fans in their spect@@ ator , the followers of Pi@@ raeus having prov@@ oked the followers of Pi@@ raeus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and were confron@@ ted with striking supporters . &quot;
at least a Bayern @-@ Fan was being transported from the stadium .
&quot; who moves , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; who pre@@ cht , thus does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - that will result in Potsdam long term study . &quot;
&quot; the good news : if a failure , the risk is becoming fast . &quot;
smoking have a considerably increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this goes out of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nut@@ riti@@ onal Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smoking people , smoking was the risk to pre@@ mat@@ ure@@ ly lose their teeth in order to increase the 2.5 &apos; -@@ 3.6 @-@ way home . &quot;
the researchers observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
&quot; major contribut@@ ors to dental bal@@ ances exist between cav@@ ities and inflammation of the g@@ ums , emphas@@ izes the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for this perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ize the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore entering the amount of dental inflamm@@ ations in smokers .
&quot; to not clari@@ fy , however , the risk of c@@ aries is increased . &quot;
&quot; people who heard with smoking could reduce risk however , however , the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it could however take over ten years until the endanger@@ ing again to the level of non @-@ smoking , the first @-@ author Thomas Dietrich von der English University Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; to convince people to convince humans , to become non @-@ smoking , the Supreme Leader of the DI@@ f@@ E said : &quot; smoke decreased the life time . &quot;
not smoking is good for lung and vessels and leads to our findings also to good dental health until high age .
&quot; in Germany over 20 percent of the population in the age of 65 to 74 years of el@@ essness is affected by insom@@ nia , the DI@@ f@@ E divided . &quot;
earlier studies would already be pointed out that smoking rises the risk for early teeth .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ pin@@ ned the findings .

&quot; there might , for example , disp@@ utes between Chinese companies and the EU governments could also be clari@@ fied . &quot;
the most influential critic of investors ( IS@@ DS ) demanded more than one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
&quot; the traditional hear@@ ers are crit@@ ici@@ zed by opponents as one kind of parall@@ el@@ essness , extending the tax@@ pay@@ ers to the tax@@ pay@@ er , national law , or to ass@@ ert a drop of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in first opinions , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organisations such as Camp@@ act committed the proposals to the European Commission than in@@ adequate . &quot;
the crit@@ ici@@ zed above all was that they do not apply to the trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .

a del@@ ici@@ ary folk by Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens is on stage in Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to it , a fli@@ pchart , mounted on the in@@ timi@@ date Fol@@ ks@@ cian of the picturesque USA @-@ state of Michigan , recorded with felt @-@ tip pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 persons , is nearly taken by Stev@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; he tells of various places he &apos;s always records on the map , which he tells of his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ously and tender songs . &quot;
&quot; where they were created , and how it looks like there , in his homeland . &quot;
&quot; ever , Stev@@ ens has appeared as a wonderful creative Irish . &quot;
&quot; published in 2003 and the third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; brings wise composed songs that can drift in very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but at any time can toler@@ ate the great opul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ our arises , &quot; Michigan &quot; is the first part of a ver@@ woven series : each of the 50 states should be inf@@ lic@@ ted in a row . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , a &quot; seven Sw@@ ans &quot; appeared and positively breaks positive expectations . &quot;
Stev@@ ens calls to Stev@@ ens here .
live suff@@ ice him guitar and ban@@ jo .
&quot; a year later , the musician returns to the series in New York . &quot;
&quot; in 2005 , &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Fr@@ oise &quot; &quot; appears a nationwide celebrated masterpiece in 2005 . &quot;
bor@@ rowing on ideas and st@@ ile fin@@ esse .
the album is entered into the American Bill@@ board Charts and is missing in any year list of the influential music media .
&quot; according to his very productive medicine , Stev@@ ens also encourage themselves on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) , extensive electronic temp@@ t@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; this sixth ordinary studio album is still very large orchest@@ rated , but produced by programmable sequences or Be@@ ats and plays with all effect and rever@@ b . &quot;
&quot; the smaller clubs has already begun long ago , the stage ho@@ ws will be colored here for colorful spec@@ ulation of Neon @-@ head@@ bands , and large fluorescent and multi @-@ fluorescent crowd pul@@ l@@ ete . &quot;
currently touring Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens is part of a five member band through Germany .
&quot; in the dark , Hamburger More ! &quot;
&quot; Theater presents itself primarily for its &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Lo@@ well , &quot; which has been available since March . &quot;
&quot; even though there were almost 2000 guests who were running in their chairs , the clearly more mature , Stev@@ ens goes back to in@@ tim@@ acy and for folk . &quot;
&quot; without creating a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays through the broad @-@ enriched album . &quot;
he hears the audience : &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you could handle the &quot; bottom @-@ bottom plate . &quot;
&quot; only to an en@@ core , Stev@@ ens added a modest , acou@@ stically playing some older songs and ultimately ti@@ pped under tos@@ sing appl@@ ause . &quot;
&quot; Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ man &apos;s debut in the prime minister &apos;s findings , &quot;
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ist &apos;s debut in the prime minister of the Prime Minister is eag@@ erly awaited since its election . &quot;
&quot; the new Labour leader Martin Cor@@ by@@ n should give his debut in the prime minister of the Prime Minister , and create Cameron for the first time . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ lob@@ n is ex@@ iting to ask the first of its six given questions , shortly after noon , but most of his power will probably be tested by the media and the Labour MEP . &quot;
he called for &quot; fewer theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
&quot; he also said that he could ski@@ p some meetings , to leave them colleagues . &quot;
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary exam for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ist &apos;s leadership , because she comes to his appointment as a member of the Ch@@ att@@ endant member and after his speech at the TU@@ C Conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour Party , on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the battle of Britain in silence , prov@@ oked by a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS and focuses on several main pages stories in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ man &apos;s decision to sing not the national an@@ them , has drawn attention to itself &quot;
&quot; a speaker of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; in respec@@ tful silence &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , announced the Labour Party to sing the National An@@ them , &quot; independent of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow @-@ ministers have refused to serve with Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s leading team , and they are called on differences in economics , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party has originally supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the BBC correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences may also be combined within Labour , &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s statements on the European Union and the limitation with earnings . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference for making the Labour Am@@ end@@ ment to remove the whole idea of del@@ eli@@ mit .
&quot; Mr Smith , the shadow of working and pensions , Mr Smith stated that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that the government should only be reduced to a £ 26@@ ,000 limit of £ 26@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron . since he &apos;s T@@ ory boss has passed over the Disp@@ atch @-@ Box in the past decade . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader , which promised a different policies , says that he had &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; ideas for Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister of the Prime Minister is con@@ front@@ ational , and that he will under@@ go both &quot; impact &quot; and the stretch with resistance , and instead has serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Merkel wants to represent the shadow trade minister , if he does not participate - for example if Mr. Cameron is on his way abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation , that other colleagues sometimes grab the word , and that he had addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the university , in order to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he was elected leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he would remove from his policy in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theater &quot; who was often associated with the fac@@ ades of the Prime Minister . but several years later he admitted he was having failed . &quot;
&quot; as they were sent first on TV in 1990 , freight wound was regarded as the most important bar@@ omet@@ re of the judgement and his position under his parliamentary group , even though critics have argu@@ ed that they have become a caric@@ ature and require a far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

Po@@ unds increased by accelerated approval growth in the United Kingdom
the pound has been spr@@ inkl@@ ed after data which raises an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel with the F@@ T@@ SE 100 the F@@ T@@ SE 100 was enhanced by the St@@ ot@@ s@@ Target SA@@ BM@@ iller .
&quot; between May and July , the result , excluding bonuses in the United Kingdom grew 2.9 % over the same period of the same period last year . &quot;
this percentage had been the fastest and produced ass@@ ess@@ ments at the time of interest .
the pound was climbed by more than 1 % from the dollar to $ 1.@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the Euro to 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
&quot; the F@@ T@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after the takeover offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; one transaction would combine the two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring stamps how well , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry stocks were encouraging by the competition guidelines for luxury goods by 0.9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures suggest all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - growth again .
&quot; Go@@ en@@ core shares rose 5 % , after the mining of mining said that it took $ 2.5 billion by a stock to be a part of its strategy of debt . &quot;
&quot; the shares of the packaging and paper company MON@@ DI have been the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decrease , after Gold@@ man Sachs has put its assessment for the &quot; &quot; company rating &quot; . &quot; &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % after the company had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.6 million for the first half year .
&quot; the boss of J@@ D Sports means that higher wages can end@@ anger expansion . &quot;
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Co@@ w@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers .
&quot; but it is unlikely that these merchants will be the same labour costs in his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs . &quot;

it is currently Mon@@ sie@@ ur Bie@@ ber in Berlin .
and Generation U@@ 17 is shooting through .

not bad .

Peg@@ i@@ da poster is a view of the potato @-@ ön@@ er idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
it is both - and the Pot@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay of the Ol@@ die @-@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay in the potato class .
&quot; based on the award &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; on a poster by the Peg@@ i@@ da movement , Al@@ h@@ ay caught potato and meat together on a sk@@ e@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes , instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he had seen inci@@ dentally in television . &quot;
&quot; it has since turned to a grill sk@@ e@@ wer , who is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is multi@@ cult for the stomach , &quot; Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
the idea has now begun to enter in Munich at the Patent Office .
&quot; since she has been protected as a utility room , she has recently been protected as a utility . &quot;
&quot; how much flesh and how much potatoes does the sk@@ e@@ wer , Al@@ h@@ ay will not want to dis@@ close . &quot;
&quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; it tastes even better &quot; , &quot; he finds . &quot;
&quot; even with its customers , the culinary international understanding is good . &quot;
Met@@ ra will kick off soil dig@@ iti@@ vity campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - In@@ fest@@ ation
met@@ a tries to protect the IG@@ A branches off a Al@@ di rally in South Australia and Western Australia .
whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers Met@@ re has launched a soil degra@@ dation campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a 700 million al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of next year , Met@@ in and IG@@ A @-@ supermarkets rein@@ force its relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand IG@@ A by mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing about the social media as well as events such as Adelaide . &quot;
&quot; IG@@ A dealers and suppliers leap on board , with brands such as ice @-@ maker fen@@ ders from D@@ H@@ borough , distributed in IG@@ A @-@ stores , and shop@@ pers that sell the approved tickets for the South Australian Football League in league . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that met@@ a cash flows further details on its defense strategy on September 29 , when the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers execute food , alcohol and devices , to its annual investors strategy day . &quot;
&quot; it is much in the game , since South Australia and Western Australia generate almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A @-@ shop businesses and higher profit mar@@ gins of the Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the Eastern States . &quot;
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial , and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia , compared to about 14 percent in Eastern Australia . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts as Morgan Stanley believe that Al@@ di is taking off for about five percent of the food market in these two states and will take on all existing actors but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published in this week , the Analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stanley is estimated that $ 360 million revenue per year and met@@ a credit could lose 250 million dollars by the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the assumption is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will stores 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year , generating a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market . &quot;
&quot; the loss in the food and grocery store and in the quantities at Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed costs could cost Met@@ cash roughly $ 13 million in profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , met@@ cash lost market shares in the Eastern States , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey of Roy Morgan had found that IG@@ A @-@ buys are the most likely . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stanley is buying sales in the food and market growth of 3.8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2017 , and its market share will reduce by 14 percent in 2015 to 10.4 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week the leading fund managers Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , in a business meeting in Melbourne , that will probably be able to disappear in a decade . Met@@ cash dis@@ appears . &quot;
Met@@ ra refused to respond to the Mr Dou@@ glass commentary .
but it is assumed that a board member has recorded in contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; IG@@ As market share has decreased from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and food retailers report around 1,200 Swiss francs , has been reflected in the debt reduction in terms of pressure and mar@@ gins since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers rep@@ elled and investing more than $ 150 million in order to improve sales prices with Col@@ es and Wool@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products any week , and IG@@ A retailers in improving their shops through faster and better choice of private label foods . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price changes and load remedi@@ ation programs are getting started and hopes that major dealers will return to a winning growth in 2017 over the first time in four years . &quot;
&quot; Than@@ zi Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of the Australian tennis League , Steve He@@ aly &quot;
Than@@ zi Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is deser@@ ved more praise as criticism for his behavior .
&quot; Than@@ zi &apos;s co@@ ch@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; coll@@ ater@@ ally damages &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick , Kyr@@ gy@@ os and deser@@ ved after the view of the President of the Australian tennis belt Steve He@@ aly will rather praise as criticism for his own behavior . &quot;
&quot; co@@ ch@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os that always den@@ oted as &quot; Special KS , &quot; came into the lim@@ el@@ ight by the in@@ famous C@@ yr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying match in Cincinnati , co@@ ch@@ ak@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison has had to be separated by the arbit@@ er . &quot; &quot; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was recently seen how he hit a tennis ra@@ cket which he had crashed into a new US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , co@@ ch@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth on the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ finals against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing I am in touch with me is the fact that after my opinion , Than@@ zi was a little bit in the dispute , &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he has broken up a ra@@ cket when he lost because of a grid in the US Open , but he is not the first player to be broken up with himself and I know Than@@ zi is good enough to know that he is not proud of that . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has kept extremely well in the US Open , even under rather the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances of Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around him and I think he was a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits in the team and so on , he is practic@@ ed with the other players , he &apos;s worked hard , he &apos;s good in shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he ear@@ ns it to be judged in his own service . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly did not support the decision that C@@ yr@@ gi@@ os won &apos;t take into account , that begins on Friday and describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right choice for everyone , but he secu@@ res the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term firm to return to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is entirely focused on the competition and not all around the contro@@ versy surrounding &#91; &apos; Kyr@@ gy@@ os &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; and I think Nick has done very quickly the ascent , which people like Feder@@ er and Murray pointed out . it desc@@ ends in the eyes of the public , and he &apos;s trying to help him , but we try to think him that it &apos;s best for the team and it is best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declared emergency , closes the border , continues refugees &quot;
&quot; Hungary declared the emergency state and war signed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held out all that attempted to get illeg@@ ally in the country , trying to stop the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
chaos followed on the border when hundreds of migrants re@@ acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted to Serbian civil servants .
&quot; the people who had fled before violence , set for an unknown period in a road ro@@ am on the road between the two control points of the countries , and built tents , and settled there . &quot;
but fru@@ strations were climbed .
&quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ vering over them , the migrants &apos; government posts the border ! &quot; and cried out the ins@@ ults towards the Hungarian ri@@ ot police . &quot;
some restrictions in protest food and water back .
Serbia &apos;s Serbia practic@@ ed it would be &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants coming from Hungary would arrive more and more from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; in the coming days of discussions with Brussels and other countries , I@@ vic@@ a Dac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot;
&quot; the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border ended a day after the 28 @-@ nations sub@@ block at a meeting in Brussels , not a common immigration policy could not agree . &quot;
&quot; the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the above Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally , next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would that the EU states would take further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday at a special summit in the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not bet its hopes for an early action of Brussels and its neighbours . &quot;
&quot; authorities rec@@ alled in two southern regions in two southern regions where authorities blocked powers on managing the crisis so that they could accelerate roads and asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to stated that his country also plan to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after it has ended up a fence on the Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News Cor@@ respon@@ dent : Charlie T &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates remain in the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a considerable bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and finally became an entry point to the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted on insi@@ sts that most of the incoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and non @-@ war refugees that will be eligible for protection - a view that strongly lies in contra@@ diction to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , turn the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall Za@@ us , who would build the government along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws apply even higher adhes@@ ion to human traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; based on the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared a state of emergency , &quot; said governmental speaker Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs Rep@@ orters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must not yet agree on the use of the military , which is expected for next week but rep@@ orters from Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ safety adviser to Or@@ ban , said that authorities learn about 45 people attemp@@ ting to cross the border , 15 others have already entered deeper into the country . &quot;

election 2016 : Hillary Clinton semi @-@ hal@@ ved at the national survey by Ber@@ nie S@@ anders
&quot; Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit advantage in the democratic race around the nomin@@ ation at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders into the bottom of the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent previously ) , while S@@ anders had a second place , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced himself to win the presidential candidate for the presidential campaign , backed by 15 percent of democratic voters . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the pre @-@ elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined to support them as candidates . &quot;
but Clin@@ ics supporters are more resistant than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS news survey Clinton lost groups in a series of demo@@ graphic groups , while S@@ anders had some win@@ nings . &quot;
&quot; Clinton doesn &apos;t hold a big advantage with women and temper@@ ate , but these jumps has reduced . &quot;
&quot; their support for the men is pl@@ ung@@ ed down , and S@@ anders are only decl@@ ining with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; at the end of 50 , the &quot; &quot; Pos@@ itive Advantage &quot; &quot; for the 50 @-@ year @-@ old voters ti@@ led , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height . &quot;
but Clinton has a big advantage over the older voters .
&quot; in the past month , Clinton had a double @-@ digit advantage in the Liber@@ als , but it now has a 5 @-@ point head start in this group . &quot;
&quot; around half of the voters were in the country so far , telling them that they &apos;d be supported by enthusiasm when it was nominated by the party . &quot;
one quarter would support them with some web sites and only support another 15 percent would only support them because they are the can@@ did@@ acy .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps it &apos;s not surprising that Clin@@ ton &apos;s current Supp@@ orters are especially enth@@ r@@ alled by her .
the views are strongly mixed by the ones who don &apos;t support Clinton - only about one quarter it would enth@@ use it enthusi@@ ast@@ ically .
&quot; while 48 percent of democratic voters say that they will support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less republi@@ can voters as well as Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clin@@ t Supp@@ lies in an open question , why they want it is the most common question that it is the right experience ( 16 per cent ) , followed by the opinion that it is time that a woman president is president ( 13 per cent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Clinton &apos;s supporters , the connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned . &quot;
approval of dealing with the problems and the voters are being rec@@ alled .
&quot; as the vice @-@ president put an potential for the presidential term in the scales , 57 percent of democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; when democratic voters are asked for the elections , who for the party would be their second choice , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
more than half of Clinton &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would have their second choice far off their s@@ anders .
&quot; however , Bi@@ den did not decide to shift the nomin@@ ation of Democrats in advance of S@@ anders , of 20 points with Bi@@ den in competitions on 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; among the five @-@ five percent of democratic voters , Clinton flew as a can@@ did@@ acy with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure has sunk from 78 per cent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second during this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; election &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , in the question of what is more important for candidates , the Democratic voters call questions on the voters . &quot;
&quot; similarly to last month , no single democr@@ at@@ ised candidate or potential candidate for this voters ti@@ mid a presidential candidate for the un@@ acceptable . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic candidate , or potential candidates take good results in some important tra@@ its of the election in voters . &quot;
&quot; Bill , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den are tru@@ ely tru@@ ely and tru@@ st@@ worthy and tru@@ st@@ worthy with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; with the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best with hon@@ esty while Clin@@ ics is the power . &quot;
&quot; thirty per cent of democratic voters think that Clinton is honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many say the more than S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have the opinion of him . &quot;
&quot; they also have democratic voters , in general , Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; with all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as an answer to Hillary Clinton &apos;s personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term in office as Foreign Minister , most of the Democratic voters are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinion does not have influenced overall . &quot;
but it is another story in the American public .
&quot; half of Americans now is dis@@ satisfied with its explanation , while only about one @-@ third is happy . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ versy had no impact on their general opinions , even though 36 percent said that their opinion of her is badly wor@@ sen@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; there are mostly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 that are saying that their views from Clinton are worse . &quot;
&quot; even though Clinton is considered to be honest men &apos;s voters as honest and trusted , this is still a problem for them under registered voters . only 32 percent see them as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 % of those entitled to vote are not for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time there are 55 percent of those entitled to vote as well as not hon@@ estly and un@@ tru@@ st@@ worthy .
&quot; Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good marks in the lead . &quot;
&quot; six of the six @-@ tested aspir@@ ation records Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best among them . &quot;
&quot; a majority sees others rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son , many do not think of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters during the preliminary election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son passed back on the country closer to Donald Tr@@ ump on the country .
Ben Car@@ son is located at the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; at the time of both candidates , half of voters fell victim to a new pol@@ l in the new pol@@ l , and others fell dramatically . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters continued to keep ongoing tr@@ ump in large numbers . support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted by Fox News debate in the past month to be 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son launched 6 % to 23 % during the same period .
the survey revealed that Car@@ son continues to get well in demo@@ graphic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump among republi@@ can voters .
&quot; the rest of the field , except for Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio - Governor John Kas@@ ich , is beaten by Wis@@ con@@ sins Governor Scott Walker , who died at the bottom , by 10 % support this last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Florida Governor Je@@ b Bush , former Governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are with 6 % on the third place . &quot;
the error mar@@ ge in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , demonstrates that Car@@ son increases in the p@@ olls in 19 % support for rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind Tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot;
the most recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post shows Tr@@ ump clearly above Car@@ son .
&quot; with a look at one in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some side curtains for former neuro@@ surgeon even after Car@@ son decided to question the Tr@@ um@@ ps faith in question . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump added last Saturday during a campaigns show in Io@@ wa . &quot;
pleasant swimming @-@ temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is now up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even when peak values are measured only in the distance , one trip to the Mediterranean is enough to take up warm water . &quot;
&quot; a swim in the North or Baltic Sea , with a more maximum of 17 degrees , will be a rather short pleasure . &quot;
&quot; not far into the sea . no more than 18 degrees Celsius , the water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea in this week , shares the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , bathing temperatures can continue to rise to the Mediterranean . in the east , it reaches up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , it is 25 degrees in the top , down in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt arrives at 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood combined with the death of an Bar@@ uch college ne@@ ophy@@ ring
&quot; almost two years after a student had passed during a sh@@ re@@ ous rit@@ ual of a student association in Po@@ con@@ o mountains , Pennsylvania , he will have submitted M@@ ord@@ an@@ tics for five people . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood now attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory rit@@ ual in September 2013 , and delayed his transfer into the hospital which contributed to his death . &quot;
&quot; officials said that he was loaded with connected eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeated , while trying to join a frozen field on a frozen field . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell down un@@ conscious . &quot;
members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the call number 911 after Den@@ g had been strengthened and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital so the police .
&quot; however , they had time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing to put his symptoms of goo@@ gle and Andy Men@@ g to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to take counsel , &quot; said pol@@ ishing Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , members of the utensils began to hide and established the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood in principle over the &quot; Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; Sh@@ eri@@ ff Wagner said . &quot;
&quot; he couldn &apos;t revi@@ ve again , and he died in the morning at his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after a aut@@ op@@ ilot report , Den@@ g was repeated with silent power of injuries to the head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies since 1970 every year by the ban@@ anas , &quot; says Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer for the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and its members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
&quot; a County Grand Jury of Monroe received an indictment due to murder of murder , for the first five members . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are accused of crime attacks and formation of a criminal organisation . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to take responsible for the involved persons only , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ officially - this will be a message , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood and the national Brotherhood have contradi@@ cted its affili@@ ation to the local group .
&quot; that will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest , &quot;
&quot; a threat comes , and the house will return to the Wan@@ ke , will get back for bonds , and the economy will slip into a recession . &quot;
we know that .
&quot; what we don &apos;t know , how long will it take , and how long it will stop . &quot;
&quot; in particular , history for the economy offers only small guidance for the economy . &quot;
&quot; a recession produced within just 11 months , after the first interest rate of interest and lasted 86 months . &quot;
&quot; the aggressi@@ veness of the Federal Reserve is often , if not always , a factor in such as the economy and financial investments react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives from the U.S. Central Bank therefore stressed that investors should not concentrate on how it begins to increase the interest rates , but rather , for the period , which is required for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , market participants could conclude that the whole excitement was probably excessive due to a Zin@@ al threat . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will be in@@ ref@@ uted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op in Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest to normal high heights , but still on low level to cast a seis@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effects . &quot;
here is a look at historical trends @-@ based look at how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the advantage of interest expense allows for a while volatile . &quot;
&quot; once the increase hit , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency to increase total income from 12 to 24 months after the initial increase , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German bank analysts in a recent study to what happens to zinc u@@ th@@ og@@ ations of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more precisely , the market is mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent in the upward trend , almost flat in the 250 days after that ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , with an average return on the previous six months according to a current analysis that published by Bob D@@ oll , boss complex strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares will occur on the Incre@@ ase cycle later , and returns to reduce the yield of the shares . &quot;
&quot; rec@@ ession@@ ary are a matter of economic power , but Zin@@ man threats they often promote . &quot;
&quot; in current case , the F@@ ed is confron@@ ted with some conditions which could not existed before and speed up a recession . &quot;
&quot; extremely remarkable is that the gross domestic product is in the vicinity of its lowest point , with a interest rate of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , on the number of 118 r@@ als , the nominal GDP has only been below 4.5 percent since 1950 . &quot;
&quot; even though the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few that this will last and expect only 1.5 percent to expect the third quarter . &quot;
&quot; ver@@ interest in a so frag@@ ile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; whether it is different this time &quot; , &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants have made this year on a zinc hei@@ t of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the session of the Federal Open Market Committee this week working on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could be an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trade gives only an average probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all the increases cycles from 1950 to this day have taken place in a super @-@ cycle with increasing moment@@ um in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ ession@@ aire were put very quickly after the start of recovery in the sha@@ dows , according to the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is clearly long @-@ term recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months and this has been previously 74 months .
&quot; the solid income was also volatile , because the market has an interest rate , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than for shares if they change their strategic course .
&quot; for bonds , returns the road in the direction as soon as the first increase / drop is done in the cycle . &quot;
at the end of the performance cycle the bond yields are immediately exp@@ elled and said the Deutsche Bank .
&quot; the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in the interest rates will result , that the rise of length@@ ens is closer to longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atter of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ rate bonds often results in such a climate even better yields , although &quot; we still are c@@ auti@@ ous to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come An@@ al@@ yst@@ in during a analysis . &quot;
&quot; interesting is that Jones , believes the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some evidence that the market has adapted to the view of stri@@ cter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the short term interest has increased , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , len@@ ten@@ se have expanded and increased vol@@ atility - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed intensi@@ fies its strategy . &quot;
&quot; throughout the large and whole , companies bringing in the larger part of their business activities in the United States are prof@@ iting , if interest rates are rising and local products will be attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational corporations with high debts will be worse , as an increasing dollar posted its products on the global market and also the financing of their debts . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares will likely to have a positive impact on the customer &apos;s initial interest rate , &quot; Gold@@ man Sachs analysts in a report submitted to the customer . &quot;
&quot; companies with strong balance sheet today were exceeded by 5 percentage points after all of the weak interest in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot;
companies with high capital yields and low vol@@ atility in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a huge problem .
&quot; companies with a high percentage of flexible interest will lose the most , Gold@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; outside the pure stock , consumers are also benef@@ iting from increasing revenues . &quot;
&quot; savings could see gains by higher yields , even if experts of different opinion are , how quickly this will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Euro MP Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
the con@@ serv@@ atives Member of the Parliament crit@@ ici@@ zing the broad@@ caster because of its &apos; stup@@ idity &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is increasingly being able to differenti@@ ate of commercial ri@@ vals .
he was also targeted at the BBC Music Awards and said that she was only The Br@@ its
European Parliament collector Dam@@ ien Collins opposed the program The Voice to and said that this is not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; conver@@ ts to Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading parliamentary committee and increases new pressure on the transmitter , to prove that he does something that does not do the priv@@ ate@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ serv@@ atives , Andrew B@@ ingham , also said to the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public broad@@ caster radio station &quot; susp@@ ects &quot; and increasingly be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; dam@@ s &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
he was also targeted at the BBC Music Awards that started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you are trying to do something different - these are two spontan@@ e@@ ously known examples , in which you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said . &quot;
&quot; BBC @-@ General Director rejected the accus@@ ations and argu@@ ed that the BBC Radio 3 goes well before his commercial compet@@ itor , when it comes to live music and education . &quot;
what I learn from Radio 3 I &apos;ll learn about classic music no somewhere else .
and there &apos;s a commitment to live music and music doing it really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the engagement of radio 3 , new music and new works on order , I think it &apos;s really important to me , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argue that he had to work hard to engage in the audience , as it did in the past , because the British informed less about classical music . &quot;
&quot; however , radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , while at the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sport for this under fire , the commercial ri@@ vals had fallen into their feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory @-@ MP Dam@@ ien Collins , The Voice to - the musical talent show at BBC , which was bought by Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of € 22 million . &quot;
&quot; see why this program is often discussed , since it is not original and not especially distinctive ? &quot;
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced on a special BBC @-@ way .
&quot; he added , he wants the company to find a hit from our house @-@ house stable , &quot; when it starts the next time an entertainment series . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to include the order of further rows of The Voice in the future or to spend money of the applicant for other maintenance formats . &quot;
Internet sales increased in August at the slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for this
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest result since the start of records in 2000 . &quot;
online sales increased 3 years ago through the use of cell@@ phones to purchase
experts believe that the Black Friday bra@@ ked the Issues in November
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping has been dr@@ illed , and many of the Great Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have transformed into Gei@@ ster@@ Cities . &quot;
&quot; experts say that there are now signs that online sales are stag@@ n@@ ating , after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the start of records in 2000 , with only five percent increase on the previous year . &quot;
experts say that there are signs that online sales stag@@ n@@ ating after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back in 2000 , this has always been developed , &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales complex . &quot;
&quot; he explained that the online sales were getting stronger than a buyer , prior to three years ago , with their cell@@ phones . &quot;
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments such as home on the sofa .
&quot; but now we comm@@ utes themselves , and we may see that the growth is reduced . &quot;
the Black Friday phenomenon that was imported from America is cited as a reason for arriving users .
&quot; experts believe that buyers will take their purchases in this event , which will take place last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers had their computer to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealer websites cuts off . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , where the buyer intenti@@ onally set aside for bar@@ gains , purch@@ aser of them to take off shopping . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium finds out that 5 £ spend a little more than £ 1 online .
&quot; in some products such as television and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of those purchases successfully completed via web @-@ shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than one quarter of people clothing and shoes online rather than selling fashion labels in the inner city ma@@ ids . &quot;

&quot; an Arabic version of the decree pro@@ mul@@ gated by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the news agency in English does not refer to this detail , however , said that the leadership of the Company &apos;s journeys are prohibited . &quot;

Mrs. Lau@@ ry said she wants to spend more women in B &amp; Q shops as eight out of ten buying decisions in the store are taken by women .
&quot; at the moment , men weigh the men . &quot;
&quot; she said it was necessary to exhibit the growing demo@@ graphic trends that are more female , more female single @-@ households that are under@@ going significant renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs. Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we must move this stronger towards a balance .
basically half of our customers in women account for 80 percent of the decisions concerning the sale of articles by women .
women play a great role in making process .
&quot; Mrs. Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of a British in the F@@ T@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also adopted her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women including his management board and financial affairs .
Mrs. Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - this is an important topic here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board . &quot;
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and the turnover after the group rejected costs for the closing of the shops .
&quot; due to the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches . &quot;
function of a@@ I / D@@ et because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the regional court Kl@@ agen@@ furt on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian volleyball player a@@ I / D@@ et had to be responsible for un@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and destruction .
the def@@ endants pleaded not guilty .
one of them was also charged with authority .
&quot; on this alleg@@ ation , he was final in May . &quot;
the current process has been postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the def@@ endant had cryst@@ alli@@ zed out , that the def@@ endants were from the United States in 2006 to 2011 of funds , which they were able to di@@ funding for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the amount has been handled by about 400,000 euros . &quot;
the sports officials are also charged with financial acts .
&quot; the fact that Micha@@ ela San@@ in , Judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in , retired from this fact . &quot;
it should be covered at a later date .
&quot; the defence to the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity was , in no time , a wealth of assets was established . &quot;
&quot; the sports officials had only dep@@ ended roy@@ alties and the sports club , for which they had been working from 1982 to 2011 and invested some time and money from the liabilities - the Passi@@ va was around 600.000 EUR in the year 2001 ( roughly EUR 4@@ 4,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we were faced with the situation : do we lead the club further or block it ? , &quot; one of the def@@ endants , in the bread @-@ professi@@ ons of the financial department . &quot;
&quot; with his colleague and co @-@ def@@ endants , he decided to take on this task . &quot;
with all the risks .
&quot; we fin@@ ed cash out of our life insurance policies as security at the bank , &quot; he said during the donation . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , no debt can be made . &quot;
fore@@ sees - with such financial success - the payout of the allowance demand was approved until 1991 .
&quot; therefore , I only have to pay a part of the allowance demand until the year 2003 , when an increase in the account has been paid out . &quot;
in this way l@@ ump @-@ and @-@ and @-@ detail work seemed to explain the former representative of the former homeless .
&quot; the accounts and spar@@ ks administered the two def@@ endants , said the second accused . &quot;
why the dis@@ bur@@ sement of the Association were not in detail so the judge asked .
&quot; the association did not interested in detail for financial advice , important would have been only the debt of debt so the answer . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , a case of officials began a function with authority , the amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; those were back@@ trace , the def@@ endants received . &quot;
the bank account ran on the name of the second def@@ endants and was not known to the association .
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; did the judge want to know . &quot;
the Be@@ qu@@ ad didn &apos;t answer any questions so long .
&quot; then he thought , he believed that this was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have had anything of that money that the public prosecutor represented the room . &quot;
the co @-@ accused was informed and justi@@ fying the function@@ ary .
this assignment has been form@@ ulated as &quot; compensation for damages . &quot;
why pol@@ ation itu@@ tion ? they wanted to know the judge and the public prosecutor .
&quot; the first accused would not agree that he did not agree with this formulation , since the association was never an damage . &quot;
&quot; what shall I do when the lawyer says , &quot; You are all of you from the tail@@ or . &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a law@@ suit ? &quot; he asked .
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary said that he has never entered a p@@ enny content , he calcul@@ ates only o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; he asked the association worth up to € 1,000 per month . however , the actual effort was much higher however , he added . &quot;
exact documents for the early years could not demonstrate the def@@ endants .
&quot; these were , according to an inspection , where all that had been judged correctly , were no longer kept laid , declared them . &quot;
kilometres had also the second accused .
&quot; all accommodation facilities are made in cash , with which he has to drive from his residence to the Bank to Blei@@ b@@ burg , in his statement . &quot;
the trial will continue on 23 September with the interro@@ gation of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard reaches more 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to the current number of personnel active for three years , the computer terri@@ ese is thus expanding further jobs by the company . &quot;
the sub@@ missions for the U.S. support Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) have no end .
&quot; within its restructuring , the U.S. Technology Group is planning to cut the run@@ off of 25.000 to 30.000 jobs in its company group . &quot;
&quot; thereby , the cost of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) will be saved , the company divided on Tuesday . &quot;
the step will lead to a special load of some 2.7 billion dollars that will fall off the fourth quarter .
&quot; the run@@ off of 5@@ 5.000 jobs have been running since three years , still not completed . &quot;
&quot; today , HP had some 30@@ 2,000 employees at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ share represents 2.3 per cent . &quot;
&quot; it is then divided into a new society with printers from the California Palo Alto , based on a new society : thus , the computer and printing business shall be bund@@ led together with computer servers and data for companies as well as other services . &quot;
both companies are expected to be listed on the stock exchange .
&quot; once again dis@@ appointing PC sales and a weaker consumer demand , according to its services , the second largest PC producer according to Lenovo latest . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter of July , sales of PC and print dropped by 11.5 % . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
&quot; thus , the proceeds went back in 15 of the 16 quarters . &quot;
HP respon@@ ds to the impact of folding and massive positions on the change in the sector .
&quot; the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has recently re@@ acted it enthusi@@ ast@@ ically , to buy smart phones and tablets rather than conventional computers and do more and more business online . &quot;
&quot; Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans will see a total of around 5@@ 5,000 jobs . &quot;
conflict : majority supporting the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , a direct involvement of German soldiers on combat host@@ ilities in Iraq would rather be increased : 54 percent said on the other hand , 35 percent showed to vote . &quot;
&quot; other countries are air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent are positive . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , 24 percent are involved in the conflict . &quot;

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : Serbian Viol@@ ence on the Serbian Border
&quot; on the Serbian border , R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , and water cann@@ ons led the Hungarian police to defend several hundred people outside the country . &quot;
Eur@@ one@@ al correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has experienced major shift in the border control point .
he told us by phone :
a group of refugees cut through the border .
&quot; after this , an line line had formed itself and behind the police officers he was ready to create a water cann@@ on . &quot;
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees cr@@ ammed with stones , sticks and plastic bottles according to their officials . &quot;
the officers were initially set un@@ interrupted by per@@ mint spray .
&quot; after that , the police used tr@@ än@@ ties . &quot;
much tr@@ än@@ ties was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
the group was thus dis@@ b@@ anded .
the refugees have now re@@ treated some time now .
a pregnant and obviously for@@ ce@@ ful woman was taken away from the zone .
&quot; children who had met the tear gas , cried out . &quot;
&quot; other refugees sto@@ oped in , and suffered under short@@ ness of breath . &quot;
the press pre@@ ys of the Serbian police had suffered serious injuries by the use of lac@@ ri@@ cott@@ a and pep@@ per@@ mint .
time of decision on interest rates for US bank@@ note bank
&quot; the world is observed , if the US bank@@ note bank took place on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday to meet the important decision whether for the first time ever since nearly a decade the interest is raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by 80 econom@@ ists who were interro@@ gated by Reuters , that a little more than half , the last week of view thought that the F@@ ed will do this , now consider that the F@@ ed will remain for a little longer and the interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 per cent will hold . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s a historical event because it has been seven years ago , since the F@@ ed has earned interest on NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank could leave the zero range and for@@ ging a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Head of staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good performance ratio , trillion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the lower mos@@ sy view of global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; you have warned the markets , to raise it up to an increase , but the signs indicate that the opportunities against such a move are good . &quot;
the decision to be announced at 8@@ pm GMT on Thursday
det@@ ective the death of the Delta State University
&quot; after shooting and killing of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he was on his team on the day and killed , Sh@@ annon Sullivan wrote a note that he could not do &quot; &quot; the first murder and wanted to &quot; &quot; he could not do it , &quot; gave the authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; G@@ auti@@ er , the police in G@@ auti@@ er , says that lamb , lecturer in ge@@ ography and social scientific education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning . &quot;
&quot; and he said that he had shot at someone , and one put to death . &quot;
&quot; jum@@ pers said the staff of the emergency department , so that police officers must send police officers to his home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I fired my wife yesterday evening &quot; and also said that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house but nobody will distur@@ b &quot; , &quot; but probably excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the cry for his name , and he did not give him . &quot;
lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police entered the scene they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ab@@ iss , 41 , and a handwritten note from lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , I wanted you to go back . &quot;
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me .
&quot; after writing the note , a jum@@ per ran 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he gave E@@ than Schmidt , a Professor of History , killing before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police cons@@ ul@@ led him . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know about a conflict between lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s conception . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the lamb had believed that Pr@@ at@@ iss also had a relationship with Schmidt , saying authorities on Tuesday , there was no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ un@@ iss was written by Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who testified that she was married for seven years as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but stayed friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ ab@@ iss had one daughter , the 19 is , and she was &quot; destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ ish@@ iss had her daughter &quot; absolute best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ ab@@ iss worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les , that was identified as a close friend from the Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ ab@@ iss . &quot;
Kno@@ w@@ les said that Pr@@ at@@ iss had a dog named Light@@ ning to have met for about three years with a lamb for about three years .
&quot; she wanted to help others ever , &quot; said Kno@@ w@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police told me , lamb called for a particular point on Monday to say to them , &quot; he was not going to prison . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen brought him to Highway 1 near Green@@ ville to this night in that night , Lamb opened his car to the side and fled on foot , ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; lamb received a PhD in Spring 2015 by Delta State University , such as his biography on the University &apos;s website . &quot;

&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some st@@ res@@ sy years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 , he fought against leuk@@ emia and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partners , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ et , for cancer . &quot;

all this calls for sure his tribute .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group
the Lufthansa is planning a big group structure .
&quot; in a year , the Lufthansa Group also plans to save a half billion euros in a better organization . &quot;
the Group will cost around 1000 executives around the world .
with the pilot structure there are in the new negotiations .
the Lufthansa is building its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the Euro@@ scep@@ tics fee .
&quot; the strategic orientation imp@@ lies an account contribution of some 500 million euros per year from cost and earnings sy@@ ner@@ gies , published the airline on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , there is no more Executive Board for passenger transportation at Lufthansa . &quot;
the Euro@@ scep@@ tics area should be so independent as it is possible .
&quot; in the new Executive Board , head Carsten Spo@@ hr will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in the future . &quot;
&quot; with the re@@ lining , spo@@ hr under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the group will soon want to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and easy@@ jet . &quot;
&quot; to date , the organization of the 120 000 employees was working complex . &quot;
&quot; under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group , the company will operate three quarters of annual sales of € 30 billion . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the case of the pilot , the negotiations on this Thursday will be scheduled to be resumed on this Thursday . &quot;
that divided the union .
the theme of the talks will be the retirement schemes for pilots .
cockpit was &quot; quick@@ est possible results &quot; in a year with a projected record result .
the conflict between the union and the airline carried out a number of strikes in the past few months .
&quot; in addition to the trans@@ itional provision of the pilot , the pilot concept has been &quot; Wings . &quot; &quot;
it is noticeable that the Lufthansa flights in the fight against competitors for the line @-@ up at the Euro@@ swing line .

Luke Shaw in Manchester United may not play on time for double fra@@ cture
&quot; at the Champions League defeat at the PS@@ V Champions League , Luke Shaw is a double fra@@ cture of his right bone . &quot;
&quot; while having left the left defence to weeping and to close it for at least a period of six months , Louis van Ga@@ al will not give up hope that Shaw is able to play again in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a re@@ reck@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ hat Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Shaw broken into the PS@@ V area .
&quot; he was treated for nine minutes at the field , and taken up the oxygen before he was hosp@@ itali@@ zed . &quot;
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg fra@@ cture and is located in the hospital .
tomorrow he moved tomorrow or perhaps one day later he was operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who came with 18 to Manchester United , it is very difficult and then plays fantast@@ ically , and then it happens . &quot;
in the store cabin he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
&quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double fra@@ cture , it takes six months and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy with a red card and the hanging of an el@@ et .
&quot; Nic@@ ola R@@ izz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator judge , did not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al believes that the Italian arbit@@ er had been wrong .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an eleven @-@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very worse attack with both legs .
&quot; twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws account sounded : &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I &apos;ll be stronger again . &quot;
in total : Manchester United has the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat at the PS@@ V
the England def@@ ender has added an additional inc@@ entive for the European championship in France until the coming June .
&quot; Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V coach , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves this kind of injury to the square , all are very sad . &quot;
it &apos;s never the intention of our player to kill an enemy .
&quot; Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break , served as Mexico during the 2014 World Cup during the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that there is a very aw@@ ful injury , that is not good , &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for me , it was not possible to see the moment . &quot;
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball bearing in another direction , so it looked like if he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; speaking with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know what feels like it , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad here . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - following a le@@ oul@@ sion by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows the Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s one thing that all parents would like to learn : if your child loves a book it will not last long until you know it almost instantly .
&quot; unless you &apos;re , you are David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; being asked by a supplier of child care systems , his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax decided in 1971 from Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult election , Cameron wrote in a message on the site of the company Super@@ Camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I liked to read my children , as it seems to have missed an image or a message that we missed so far . &quot;
&quot; all well and well except that the subsequent section , in which Cameron comes , apparently describes the plot of the book , instead a summar@@ ization of the 2012 movie , added , added the new characters and details to enhance the fairly short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the Moor@@ ish city of Th@@ urg@@ y Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a merchandise , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , ful@@ fills the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , filled with her desire to see a real tree , when he died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if that &apos;s not susp@@ icious enough : the text of the Lor@@ ax film , which is displayed on the website of the Lor@@ ax movie , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he certainly grants to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems impro@@ b@@ able that Cameron speaking the plot as little . here li@@ stens a un@@ named young , like the local environment through the gre@@ edy Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , be@@ ati@@ fied beings , &quot; which speaks in the name of trees , &quot; which is devast@@ ated . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR role was deleg@@ ated to a helper that the Lor@@ ax had not read 20 times in a row .
a Do@@ wning Street spokesperson stated that the text probably came by Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s electoral body .
&quot; super@@ camps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ ons , but gave no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was definitely threatened with exclusion from England , but it is still difficult &quot;
&quot; in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you select the Ka@@ der , the England for the Tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test serial defeat does not exist on my map . &quot;
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the Batt@@ ing list , and the spirit of a community is strong ; they will not carry any sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful approach . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een Ali was developed as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size on the test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
in this message : Adam Ly@@ th is leaving from the England Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyse . &quot;
&quot; with its seven tests , there were two good attacks in difficult conditions , and the simple , but hard reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ te@@ amm@@ ers are al@@ igned to results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question@@ mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nomin@@ ation , as - and I said this before - that players are their best cho@@ res . &quot;
&quot; long ago we have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own dest@@ iny . &quot;
&quot; hopefully he &apos;ll find further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance come out . &quot;
&quot; the England coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss comm@@ ended his attitude , even though he did not have such good achievements , and surprised me not ; he is above all a team @-@ man . &quot;
&quot; the question , how much time does a test bu@@ ker receive , to set his character , is difficult . &quot;
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Com@@ pt@@ on nine got nine .
only Com@@ pt@@ on got the chance to play home and down .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that one could rise , was that England was first in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales is coming in , and he is a striking man I guess . &quot;
&quot; he is a X @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ cker , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 236 towards us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must stop at least the same chances as they were before him , but this depends on the team for the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to suggest Mo@@ een next to cook , which would get an extra @-@ spin @-@ bow@@ ler and get four qu@@ icks can be di@@ pped , and I didn &apos;t get anything about it . &quot;
I don &apos;t see why a striking man can &apos;t strike there and this left hand has shown that he is a devil &apos;s devil . cri@@ cket @-@ player is .
&quot; mo@@ een could not get his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he &apos;s no # 3 for them , and there &apos;s no big difference . &quot;
my previous team @-@ mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 reviews on the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred inst@@ ances immediately and did not look back .
&quot; in the Ka@@ der as back @-@ up @-@ sp@@ inner , in my limited way he was very impressed with him as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may probably see his statistics - on average 31 with ar@@ ack@@ et and 35 with the ball - and think that it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inning that raises her hands and the train@@ ers have decided for youth . &quot;
he is going to learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England made a few smart supplements to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ es , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as an advisor for the test play could be a champion . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the most kin@@ dest not@@ ions of the game , having taken a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes with the white ball @-@ phase tour and brings energy and into a powerful use into the setup .
&quot; I always felt he &apos;s tail@@ or @-@ made for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
sometimes new voices can carry fresh wind in the dress cabin even if the messages are in line with what is said before .
&quot; coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes - Is not used at the one @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break from Australia and I for my part have no problem with it . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but co@@ aches and Team@@ leaders not specify the schedule . &quot;
&quot; and you must remember that , just like the players depend on their jobs . &quot;
such decisions are not taken in easy heart .
Bre@@ xit ( Bre@@ xit = withdrawal of EU from the EU ) could gain Zul@@ u from the EU when the economy shi@@ fted into a Fl@@ au@@ te force by 2017
&quot; David Cam@@ er@@ ons made un@@ trimm@@ ed re @-@ negoti@@ ate strategy to hold Britain within the EU , even without the election of the brilliant mind &quot; &quot; Is It Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n for the leader of Labour or TU@@ C , who fought back severely due to Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
the foreigners also have their pregn@@ an@@ cies and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ ate repe@@ ating that some member states , so deeply tra@@ cked in different crises , such as the EU is now and not always from their own debt , Britain &apos;s own created agenda with divided conc@@ essions and distur@@ bing changes that they are mostly not satisfied . &quot;
&quot; in Brighton , TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it to end@@ anger the social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance ministers climb to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photograph of themselves from a famous local monument , with or without local variables , come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it is all about me .
&quot; my European friend who wants to sit outside the UK inside the EU &apos;s Zel@@ ter - &quot; Leave us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and goes through that more and more short @-@ breaking ministers and officials will have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we remain or go . &quot;
&quot; while Germany &apos;s c@@ auti@@ ous Chancellor Angela Merkel is a ally , but she has been in power for 10 years before it looks bad for her , as it did in the exagger@@ ating long endurance like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and cab@@ bage ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande considers his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
he is also a w@@ ading strength .
Poland might soon have a nation@@ alistic right government in Spain .
&quot; it is hard to imagine that they &apos;re going to ri@@ p off one leg , to prevent the Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Brit@@ ons whose energy is better to prevent off from the UK - something that they did not want , because most similar separat@@ ist ten@@ dencies did . &quot;
&quot; therefore some such ministers also plan to plan un@@ helpful notes , throughout the SN@@ P @-@ style , while British speakers in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ xit process , my friend is presum@@ ed . &quot;
the re @-@ trial was a Ple@@ ite &quot; and &quot; Britain has won nothing from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how r@@ ent@@ ric the Fle@@ et Street can be on their costs , and which EU sk@@ ep@@ tics has not been the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press bar@@ ons as they were in 1975 by Tony Ben@@ n inspiring refer@@ end@@ ums in 1975 , but did not support our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; you can recall to Boris Johnson , the odd @-@ euro coin of opportun@@ ists , who has made itself a name than an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; in Brussels @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; with all his dist@@ ill@@ fulness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ car@@ ing c@@ ur@@ ks , telephone @-@ h@@ acking ali@@ ens and the phon@@ eme non @-@ in@@ countries , belonged to most of our major newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bl@@ air thought about it , but realized that if one sits with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one can give better ban@@ anas to di@@ stra@@ ct him rather than going for lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans as Bl@@ air himself when he was opposed to cam@@ er@@ ons refer@@ end@@ ously , for Bl@@ air had rejected the principle of the EU &apos;s Constitution which then turned down by French and Dutch voters that opened it back in 2005 . &quot;
the press has never forgiven him .
&quot; but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ b@@ n , who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps at the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he would not need more time for me - seems to be in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ yk@@ ott but a strategy of 80 @-@ 80 years , a mistake back then and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take last but he must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me but certainly not with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa has left it on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position to Europe - I &apos;ll cut it out - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff @-@ Ten@@ dency and the wil@@ dly skir@@ t of Tor@@ sten Klein @-@ English may probably say yes . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s that which Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n &quot; fought on the radio and on TV this week , as the sc@@ outs of the prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell prov@@ oked a bad idea as black@@ by@@ ist John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ anz@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; remin@@ ded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father fought on TV with a effort to be loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet room without losing too far and losing his cabinet . &quot;
Hil@@ ary &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to stay &quot; under all circumstances , &quot; Benn@@ s expressed himself - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said about what was Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said about what she told J@@ C to his comra@@ des on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n , I think that he even touched me - News @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and especially in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a breeding site of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is correct to give Cameron no free card for Europe , which allows him to keep lab@@ ours support in refer@@ end@@ ums to su@@ pre@@ macy , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins is thinking about that .
&quot; however , Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic am@@ big@@ u@@ ities to the EU membership - in con@@ sensus with its Benn@@ ite ins@@ ist economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion in le@@ ft@@ ist dis@@ sidents , to which the an@@ z@@ is@@ sm@@ us of the little difference is an central principle of dog@@ matic disp@@ utes . &quot;
&quot; as with its am@@ big@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son , fel@@ sen@@ ces convinced that J@@ C will not launch a campaign in the exit - will attempt to try foreign diplom@@ ats , in all , to find a sense for their superior su@@ peri@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; why should Paris or Berlin exc@@ use political capital , they have also lost mis@@ gi@@ ants - to make conc@@ essions to the British if this can be all significant ? &quot;
&quot; the USA are quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction in the T@@ ory government , which was somewhat reminis@@ cent of the previous Monday which was called the British Influ@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise public health UK report on e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; asser@@ tions of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful as smoking from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco factory , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) opened Lanc@@ et by critic@@ ise the public health in the report about e @-@ cigarettes in their report .
he published the &quot; principle report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive examination of proof@@ s . &quot;
but some researchers have provided the lo@@ ad@@ ability of the data and referred to the links between few experts and the tobacco .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month seized the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ ate foundation &quot; in which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
&quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J , and asked whether the claims are &quot; on stone or sand . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Affairs Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Medicine at the University of Liverpool , said , &quot; An basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the detection of their effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expects that the claim of P@@ he , that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less dam@@ aging than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of re@@ wise and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement consists of a single meeting of 12 people who were called to develop a model for multi @-@ criteria decision @-@ making analysis ( multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to demonstrate their opinions on the damages of various nic@@ ot@@ ine @-@ containing products ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a company from the meeting is a company called Euro@@ bonds , whose managing director had previously received by British American Tob@@ acco funds ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also signed the testim@@ oni@@ als of BA@@ T for Public Health in a sustainability report , said they . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared to receive funding from a e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the financing , which he should have obtained according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , add her . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for the selection of the board members are not supplied , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes champion , some of which also add a sector financing to paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco supervision .
the Tob@@ acco will also participate in the meeting .
the research work of the Group &quot; ad@@ mits &quot; evidence that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most of the products &quot; there was Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however there will be no further claims or limitations in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well told the claims of P@@ he that &quot; there have been no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking . &quot;
&quot; pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being with P@@ he said that the claims of BM@@ J was already re@@ acted in advance . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second lifetime smo@@ ker on its ad@@ diction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are low , but we continue to study the long @-@ term impact . &quot;
&quot; P@@ he has the unique obligation on the information provided to the public about what evidence shows and what does not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared with tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 80,000 people die annually in a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking will cost two billion US $ per year . &quot;
&quot; clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking will accomplish our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should quit East@@ En@@ ders , says former head of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chair@@ woman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said , the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would show their right arm , &quot; for Hit @-@ shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the broadcast fee should be used only to make the type of programs , which are not broadcast through other UK channels . &quot;
&quot; he critic@@ ised the BBC for making them public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard controversial time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transm@@ it@@ ters like the BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had tried for six years in his time with Channel 4 without success . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes would be commissioned or send them clearly from non @-@ subsi@@ dised ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus @-@ communications Committee as part of his investigation into the future of BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the radio fee , which I think or not for a good idea , one should at least make his production at least on programs that do not do or put on orders . &quot;
&quot; you send the Voice in a first @-@ class time@@ frame , because they want to achieve a wide support for the future . &quot;
&quot; the idea that nobody would like to show it is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , it &apos;s non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why an ar@@ est control program is financed , which could also be financed without subsidi@@ zation . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a programme , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
I try to see how public @-@ right television should be .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s inno@@ c@@ ence is on the hunt for reviews &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of men who work there and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular programmes in the BBC will give that what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Kin@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather anti @-@ legal programmes &apos; go to the BB@@ C4 , where they can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue that if they are based on their seem@@ ing missions for justi@@ fication of 4 billions of broadcast programmes , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all those ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them into a window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; for the radio station Johnson said the Committee , &quot; I encourage you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system regarding terms of conditions who can get the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course , you &apos;re thinking all we think that you get a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who &apos;s for £ 150 a lot of money , ask me whether that &apos;s true , because they do not consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also announced on Tuesday before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC must check their &quot; &quot; Rei@@ th@@ ian mission &quot; &quot; to educ@@ ate and maintain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little by the BBC production would now officially be categ@@ orized as education - he said that there are 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take part in &quot; inform , inform and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; at the question of the partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC was supposed to do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television will go on in order to make available online available online . &quot;
&apos; Son@@ ogen@@ etics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des alter the direction in which they are radi@@ ated with sound impul@@ ses .
researchers have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by the waves of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the very moment , in which they have listened to high frequencies for the human hearing to be heard . ir@@ radi@@ ated . &quot;
impul@@ ses works through the switching of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on @-@ cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultr@@ asonic tra@@ ps .
more on this topic : reading and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said , the worms revealed the power of a new process called Son@@ ogen@@ etics , to be used in ultr@@ asound to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , reported that the procedure of one day could replace the deep @-@ brain stim@@ ulation , an inv@@ asive process that ab@@ stain@@ ed electric impul@@ ses into the brain of people for treating the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; usually , the prim@@ ers are not respon@@ sive to ultr@@ asound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they were doing it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic aircraft . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , rein@@ force ultr@@ asound waves , that penet@@ rate into the worms . &quot;
&quot; the reinforced ultr@@ asonic tra@@ cts work on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 icon , and can be found in membran@@ es by some of the worms . &quot;
&quot; sound waves have the opening of these icons and activ@@ ating the cells they are assigned , such a Report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultr@@ asound controlled Nem@@ ato@@ des , Hal@@ as@@ ani changed the worms that carry out some of its Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ised TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels . &quot;
&quot; when it turns ultr@@ asound to the changed creature , sound waves are intensi@@ fied by micro@@ bub@@ bles and transferred to worms , where they turn off the changed engines . &quot;
&quot; the process has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with op@@ to@@ gen@@ etics , a ground@@ breaking tool which allows scientists to take neur@@ ons with imp@@ uls of light and turn off . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ is@@ e@@ Genetics might have some advantages over this technology .
&quot; in contrast to light , which needs to be sent down on an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asound tissue can be hin@@ dered and can be sent up into the brain at the top of the brain . &quot;
&quot; we believe that in therapy and a therapeutic virus it is feasi@@ ble , the targeted human neur@@ ons is temporarily p@@ liable for the ultr@@ asound signal in a clinical trial for specific neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ de@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells , insulin @-@ producing cells . &quot;

8 gold rules for living in a student residence
&quot; eleven years ago , I moved to a student residence in a student dormit@@ ory , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral relev@@ ati@@ vism , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile that I listened to - and to the numerous , long @-@ term complaints about others . &quot;
&quot; most of what I have learned , can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules . &quot;
&quot; the entrance in the student residence is from light @-@ winding , up to absolutely frigh@@ tening . &quot;
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to har@@ row : people tell whence com@@ est , whether and where you have taken sab@@ b@@ ital , where you stand in terms of Cor@@ lob@@ n , and why you say &quot; hon@@ estly Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it is just a yeast extract ha@@ haha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - positions and show interest .
&quot; it dis@@ covers the conversation and helps you to find out the people that you may not speak compared to those with whom you would not speak , even if your l@@ ashes were burned with fire and these extingu@@ ishers . &quot;
let people go .
&quot; people of people often turn into drinks recipes , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people wear and decor@@ ate their under@@ wear . &quot;
referring to this : do not forget to start at the university with a relationship
Intro@@ duc@@ ees get a rough handling at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student halls forms a room @-@ to @-@ space smo@@ ker culture , which is kind and soci@@ ally and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
&quot; nothing of the culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want you to go on , but you must go away so I need to go back to the energy that I used for the interaction with you . &quot;
&quot; try to feel when a pe@@ ers is exhausted from soci@@ alizing , and send SMS instead of receiving an SMS . &quot;
ap@@ rop@@ os ank@@ eth : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he looked some things .
friendship close by B@@ aking .
&quot; since you start the university at the high point of the back @-@ mania , the knock at the doors of people to introduce yourself with a plate full of browser , less strange as the welcome of the 1950 @-@ s &apos; welcome in the neighborhood , I have some baked you . so now please smile , if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
homemade treats available is a good way to include girl@@ friend@@ ships .
her ro@@ omm@@ ates feel obliged to enter@@ tain and become associ@@ ating your face with a delicious surprise .
of course this depends whether you are an employed b@@ aker .
&quot; po@@ or@@ ly mixed cl@@ ump with flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping if you anchor dro@@ pping . &quot;
&quot; to steal food , a traditional crime in student residence is home . &quot;
&quot; of course , the j@@ aw of chicken is a theft , but is it instead of a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
check it with the dairy owner .
&quot; the opportunities are good , they say they are to use themselves , even if they cook in the inner . &quot;
&quot; if anyone ste@@ als your stuff is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced than my fellow worker , who added the powder to her milk to pun@@ ish th@@ ie@@ ves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
&quot; you should make any noise , people from sleep , or away from work . &quot;
&quot; it is not just about being a constant person , but that you belong in the true sense of the prover@@ b to mankind in the glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my corridor asked her neighbors if there is something different to them , Drum &amp; Bass make it qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an examination in the morning . &quot;
they re@@ acted to the more deser@@ ts of music .
&quot; when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , they left their neighbours still sleeping two hours before she opened their own music , shut off their door , and came to her three hour test . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future wife would come home to the same student residence in random ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , it would not be ab@@ u@@ pro@@ found@@ ly embar@@ rass@@ ing when you do a fellow worker for your future mate partners , go back and see them every day and perhaps remember@@ ing how they over@@ looked all our common friends ? &quot;
&quot; naturally , the heart is its own ways - but if a hot fellow worker is definitely not your future involvement partner , try to talk at least to your under@@ wear a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment that you notice that someone has its key in a non @-@ sealed room , the limit is between a Ul@@ k and a mo@@ b@@ bing , than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good fight is funny , but it takes only moments , until he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
divide by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never dig@@ est any one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and shampoo .
&quot; shut down your door , and lay out its keys into a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but t@@ acked your owners over the ceiling , no more than twice . &quot;
&quot; terra@@ ced houses for refugees , all @-@ flying , Ger@@ ing thick@@ ener &quot;
the real estate contractor Markus Gil@@ dner reli@@ es on the Middle @-@ Fran@@ cop@@ ic Eck@@ ental terra@@ ced houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need to be living space but as well as the only educ@@ ating mother and the well @-@ deser@@ ved mother . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll show how one can still get cheap and good today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old interview in the interview &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the domestic market .
&quot; owner Markus Gil@@ dner reli@@ es on how quickly bul@@ ky living space can be established : it builds in a project terra@@ ced houses for refugees . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ tors , a lot of refugees are to push for the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : fabulous accommodation in containers or turn@@ around has no sustainability .
because people stay on a big part here .
&quot; in view of the refugee stream , we also need enough living space in the coming decades . &quot;
a very simple and dirty pit @-@ house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a terra@@ ced house needs the least place .
it facil@@ it@@ ates integration .
this is different if people are going to be placed in bar@@ cra@@ cks .
&quot; each of the six homes , which are currently being built in the pilot project , is composed of three units for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees say that it &apos;s peace again , I go back . &quot;
then houses can be converted easily according to their requirements .
how high are the costs ?
&quot; Guil@@ ds : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house is 4@@ 184 euros , without property . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
that is appropriate .
do the building regulations demonstrate their plans ?
Gil@@ deb@@ tors : I &apos;ve made my project correct .
the suff@@ rage has always been very complicated - special construction and slot design .
gr@@ in beauty .
it will still be subject to everyone who manages three houses in a terra@@ ced house .
only in the cities there is enough space .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house ?
Gil@@ dner : there she was accused of creating luxury structures for asylum seek@@ ers .
but definitely not right .
but are you not in@@ curr@@ ing competitors around paid apartments ?
&quot; Gil@@ tors : it &apos;s true : we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but only luxury apartments that can hardly be able to afford . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need living space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees but , as well as the traveling alone , or the well @-@ deser@@ ved mother . &quot;
I &apos;ll show how you can still get cheap and good today .
this is why it is .

&quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage would fit quite good in this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ um@@ ausen and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was done , I just called it . &quot;

Croatia : &quot; we leave refugees by &quot;
&quot; now the border controls were lifted up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; said Minister of Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
inspec@@ tions on the Hungarian border will remain in parallel .
&quot; what is clear , it is clear that everyone who wants an asylum request would be &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of people are in the fore@@ ground .
&quot; but it is clear , however , that there is clear signals , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we don &apos;t accept foreign flow streams , even beyond the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
&quot; before that , the Croatian government had already communic@@ ated , and there were also Slovenia , arriving in the direction of Austria and Germany , and decided under certain conditions for refugees . &quot;
but it was not that the Minister of Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar will not see her .
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors be &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather be an increased surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot;
the border with Croatia is already a strong position as the outside of the Schengen area .
&quot; as the ministry stressed , Slo@@ veni@@ ans will not give its borders for refugees but not abri@@ z . &quot;
&quot; each EU member must fill his obligations , otherwise it cannot function the system , &quot; Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government announced , the first fug@@ iti@@ ves had attempted to sail during the night hours on Tuesday to arrive in Eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to get to the registration . &quot;
in the near corn fields she could interv@@ ene in the near corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ari@@ vo , police station and new refugees ever meet in the Croatian region . &quot;
&quot; it was important for Syrians , Afghanistan , including numerous women and children . &quot;
the Red Cross is also in use too .
&quot; in the coming days , his country will be around 4000 refugees , said Interior Minister , Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; there would also be buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo on the Maced@@ onian Serbian Border , who had brought migrants to the Hungarian border so far to vote Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government of Belgrade , however , disputed that it should be imp@@ aired by people to take certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor want we to do this , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , the first bus arrived in the mor@@ nings with around 50 refugees in the Serbian Border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day another buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; Croatia , Slovenia and Austria &quot;
&quot; the passengers were traveling by Serbia all over the night , when traveling around 500 kilometres away by Serbia . &quot;
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has added , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
thereby it could actually be the predicted shift in the former Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west road .
Croatia : &quot; extensive opportunities to limit control &quot;
&quot; in fact , Croatia Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic also emphas@@ ized that his country was prepared for the case of a powerful in@@ stream of refugees &quot; appropriate plans for possible space situations . &quot;
he called not his details . he pointed out that Croatia became a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot;
we take strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has belonged to this since 2007 , the EU partner since 2007 has consistently been a good report on what concerns the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on this Serbian side , after the Hungarian border crossing , some 300 refugees continue to hold . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , they had spent the last night at the crossing of Hor@@ gos , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
according to Hungarian authorities the two border crossing of the V@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain fully closed .
&quot; whether the remaining fug@@ iti@@ ves continue to travel to the Croatian border , it is still un@@ clear . &quot;
the Serbian Minister Neb@@ o@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ anovic was trying to calm the Wednesday early at a local eye in Hor@@ gos : he will keep the debates about alternative rou@@ ters of refugees after the Hungarian border has now been closed for past .
it would not be much to deal with high refugee camps at present .
&quot; could not only be said if they would continue their journey beyond Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
people for migrants - dangerous - Alternative routes
&quot; however , private Indian workers have already begun to distribute refugees in the refugees on which alternative routes are dra@@ fted by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border area there is still 20 years after the conflict of Croatia , still not found min@@ ef@@ ields . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ ers in the border region was sent .

Fed@@ Ex @-@ results res@@ hu@@ ff@@ led by financial prospects for 2016
&quot; Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appointing results for the final quarter , and the song Gig@@ ant lowered his prize from a year on a whole year because of the weak demand for cargo services , and higher costs in its travel service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that she plans to hire approx . 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 race workers to stay for the holiday period . &quot;
the share fell over 2.5 per cent at the Pre@@ market Trade 45 minutes before the opening ceremony on Wednesday .
&quot; Fed@@ Ex Bene said , making a profit between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10,@@ 90 in the financial year ending in May , 20 cent less than in previous forecast . &quot;
&quot; according to a survey conducted by Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ . &quot;
&quot; the less@@ er view proceeds despite the price increases , which are at an average of 4.9 percent and , on January 4 , and despite a higher additions to ground transport of heavy and large packages that will be collected from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it was nonetheless expecting to increase the result from the previous year due to cost reduction , higher income and due to growth in online deal@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said , &quot; &quot; solid income has been achieved if one sees weaker than expected economic conditions , particularly in production and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for the holiday employment were announced a day later than that of the rival UPS , which plans to hire 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 extra workers , approximately the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex amounted to 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share stood at EUR 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , representing twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research , analysts predicted . &quot;
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six of the st@@ acks were expected to be 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
&quot; over the past few years , Fed@@ Ex took over a decline in the international priority area to place exp@@ orting sales in the company &apos;s express disp@@ atch . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at Fed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; net transportation increased by 29 per cent in the last quarter , but the operating result was flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the express unit recorded higher income due to higher prices , while the result for increased labour costs in the cargo sector sank . &quot;
&quot; the Pre@@ market trading , roughly one hour before the opening , rolling the Fed@@ Ex shares by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they closed an 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11th . &quot;

the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ell@@ as and their colleagues should set the nation &apos;s economic interests to all other things .
the Central Bank has a two @-@ fold order from the Congress : the maxim@@ ization of US employment and prices keep well @-@ maintained .
&quot; but since the great recession , F@@ ed leaders have recognised that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too close to predi@@ ct it . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is start@@ led by the unprecedented interest rate by the near to zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data from the economy show that they grow solid , the latest turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could make these vol@@ atility by the raising of interest to the federal government - and be it just by one quarter point . &quot;
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation in the first place will be the most important thing they watch , said Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , chief economic at the Mak@@ ing firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text , not to increase the interest rate , increased in@@ security will continue to justify the global market enough justi@@ fication , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no con@@ sensus about what the F@@ ed is going to do is uns@@ ure the tax market .
about half the econom@@ ists who recently interviewed by Bloomberg say have predicted a interest rate this week .
&quot; the financial markets , however , expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that indicates a 30 % chance . &quot;
&quot; this points to a decline in the share market , if the F@@ ed raises the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists alle@@ vi@@ ate the blow because they promise that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; Dow Jones &apos;s average scores increased by 21.@@ 28.@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed @-@ policy pursued the set during this week , &quot; said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the pro@@ positions at that time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if it does , it would have to go very far in its declaration in order to calm down the financial markets , so that it was not in panic . &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that a interest rate would calm down the financial markets because it would remove un@@ certainty when the F@@ ed would do .
&quot; one month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points per month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions which would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had already said in the spring and early summer , that in spite of the complaints of Liber@@ als she was expected to expect more economic progress would be expecting an increase of the proposition . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August did slow down , improvement was solid in this year &apos;s labour market . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate down to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and close to the level , which the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown evidence of a recovery .
&quot; and although inflation remained below the 2 % of the Central Bank &apos;s annual target , the F@@ ed Representative said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; economy &quot; can tackle higher interest rates and need them because of the tension in the labour market , &quot; said Ian She@@ pher@@ d@@ son , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the financial markets all over the world had gathered together , after China had upgraded its currency . &quot;
&quot; the Dow Jones achieved average value in May by more than 16 % below its highest , as investors feared that a slow@@ down from the Chinese economy would imp@@ lies global growth . &quot;
&quot; this month , the market has a little bit re@@ covering , the Dow Jones is now around 10 % below the May of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed Representative , market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation , when you should increase the interest . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy would not appear in the last few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. bank@@ note . &quot;
&quot; now , he predi@@ ct that she would be waiting at least one month to get the impact better in the grip . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of un@@ certainty concerning what impacts on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; overall , the health of the global economy is none of the main activities of F@@ ed , so they should not be involved in their decision @-@ making . &quot;
but in the end effect the F@@ ed Monetary System has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous throughout the years .
&quot; the mere poin@@ ter of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could handle its monetary expansion . &quot; turbul@@ ences revol@@ ved around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where the markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ woven , the F@@ ed Representative is expected to closely monitor from the F@@ ed Representative , but also advised by other central banks and experts to get a better understanding for the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the Global Strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , noted that month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ re@@ actions on financial market movements that appear with apparently not connected to the economic fundament@@ alist aspect . &quot;
&quot; L@@ acker , a registered member of the Federal Open Market Committee , set up for an interest rate , quoted decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its conduc@@ t@@ ins by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited effects on growth in the U.S. &quot; , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot;
one year later the F@@ ed representative made these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should only place aspects of financial stability only during a heavy crisis as the market leader in 2008 , Adam S. Pos@@ en said a former member of the Committee on Un@@ ins@@ ulting the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; recent turbul@@ ences are in@@ accessible close to this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to run into the situation in which they are afraid of a interest rate because the markets were exciting , &quot; said Poz@@ nan , president of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act will still contain the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability and ultimately , I do not believe that it should be expected of time . &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chinatown .
&quot; yes , Chinatown &quot;
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
&quot; LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co , and is a Thai @-@ Free Trade market , which is also sold to the general public . &quot;

&quot; the shop is huge , and it lasts for an hour , through the cor@@ rid@@ ors . &quot;
if you &apos;re hungry you &apos;re hungry for you to enjoy a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express .
the kitchen ( good and inexpensive ) in this shop is close to the box and has various recording options .
what else is there : do you need anything - anything Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
products are inexpensive and a number of them is sold in large quantities .
&quot; fresh products contain Asian speci@@ alities and local Thai herbs , fruits and more . &quot;
&quot; the meat fore@@ front is extensive , as well as the fishing industry - the staff behind the counter will clean the fish and fil@@ et it even on request for you . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ bies : small living assistance for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to prepare a warm welcome is not without the commitment of numerous volunteers .
&quot; also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ there , there are quite a number of people helping to support the asylum seek@@ ers in the city . &quot;
amongst them include Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a body and soul teacher .
&quot; even with its 74 li@@ ars , it is still taught . &quot;
they are doing it on asylum seek@@ ers from the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße every Thursday .
&quot; there are refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , there is something of other lessons as at a right school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s Gar@@ di@@ di@@ at@@ ric Company Rio Grande will promote healthy food @-@ healthy
&quot; the Brazilian rib@@ bon organization SP@@ RS tries to clari@@ fy women on the sho@@ cking way of women , how important good nutrition is during lac@@ tation . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , which give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by approximately 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake could not be the only di@@ ät@@ tic adaptation that ought to make the breasts . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet may actually fluctu@@ ate the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy eating of the child can neg@@ atively impact the immune system . &quot;
exceptions to the new Bern@@ burg Sports Hall
the Bern@@ ried Gro@@ der@@ at Bern@@ ried approved the building application for the 2.3 million Euro in Sports Hall .
and he made one exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
planning for the long @-@ desired gym at Bern@@ burg &apos;s sports grounds come step forward : in recent municipal gra@@ vit@@ ation the revised construction application was blessed without large discussions .
&quot; previously , the Panel had decided to submit a motion to a &quot; exception &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid building plan . &quot;
with the &quot; exception &quot; there was permission for a special design in terms of roof construction .
so the pan@@ el@@ ance with non @-@ armed first and roof overhead is said to be built .
&quot; background of the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar systems : &quot; &quot; this way we get a wonder@@ fully large roof of the roof , &quot; said Mayor Johann St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot;
&quot; during &quot; Liberation , &quot; in turn , the roof that is energetic on energy - is prescribed other than in the development plan below ten degrees . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the volume of the hall will be considerably reduced . &quot;
&quot; an &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; was therefore necessary because the planning regulations did not &quot; permit an &quot; exceptions . &quot; the Bern@@ rie@@ der council is generally used to restri@@ ctive to exemp@@ tion from their liberation . &quot;
&quot; however , at the turn@@ around building there is no recur@@ ring project : &quot; &quot; we do not make a preced@@ ent &quot; , &quot; said St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gy@@ mna@@ stics at the sports centre is a communal project of the church and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
&quot; at cost , approximately 2.3 million euros are registered . &quot;
grants are expected by the school and lat@@ itude enterprises .
&quot; in the next process of trial , the building application for the 18 x 36 metre hall will now be submitted to the stock exchange office . &quot;
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
Hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to be closed early as planned - namely 2016 .
it is simultaneously Prof. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) of the Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees are moving from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; at the surprising end of the district GmbH , which is mainly surprising , the Land@@ ing Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White was confirmed . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision to come off the Supervisory Board and the meeting is scheduled to take place on Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; plans should be implemented , and all the nearly 50 employees will continue working at the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital . &quot;
the overwhelming majority should be with fishermen and the far@@ able inside of station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are present .
&quot; the employees who can &apos;t go to D@@ ong@@ au , should be offered at home in W@@ eil@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
the employees are informed about the plans .
&quot; the change of the cancellation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who first became the medical director of Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year , has now changed to private practice in immediate vicinity of the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to the question of who should succeed , he came to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; into the game , who was willing to take over leadership and switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au as of October 1 . &quot;
&quot; in the case in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this means that in any event a &quot; ascension &quot; and a spreading of the offer in the field of &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; as a member of the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the supervisory board is right to bring both houses , until the next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ y , which is still over 35 beds , is to finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the County has planned this planned for 2018 , when the ongoing renovation work is completed at the W@@ eil@@ heim Clinic . &quot;
&quot; land@@ lords in J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , approached , under which the house which is in possession of the state bank will be used as a housing for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; I close this . as soon as the property keeps on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White was not able to say there are several refle@@ ctions . &quot;
&quot; at present , a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a @-@ day sy@@ chiat@@ ry are accommod@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; something better could happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; so fishermen over the tor@@ ch @-@ move to the Le@@ ch , who had been &quot; positively &quot; positively and has been accepted by the employees . &quot;
a true perspective for the house where fishermen had been working as che@@ ers for more than 30 years now .
he has been asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) stayed in the past decades of cl@@ amping , divisions were closed , for example the surgery and birth aid . &quot;
the hand of all the Rhine @-@ Neckar lions are included today ( 20.@@ 15 pm ) at the Berg@@ isches HC .
&quot; in Wuppertal the table leader of the Bundesliga was a clear favorite subject , but there is none . &quot;
in the past season the bath@@ ener past@@ ures in B@@ HC have a painful defeat and have a little heart@@ beat there .
hunting accident with two Ver@@ sions at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor sailors were severely injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday morning .
&quot; during the Aber@@ deen at Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , there were several h@@ unters on deployment to the police . &quot;
after a donation the 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were carried out in hospitals .
how exactly it could happen to the accident was un@@ clear .

miss 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Pfalz victims of violent crimes
a tat@@ too susp@@ ect has led the police for dead bodies of the Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
&quot; in the interro@@ gation , the 20 year old had to kill the juven@@ iles and to have cast their bodies into a channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
a year @-@ old girl from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate is missing from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate . it has fallen victim to violent crimes .
&quot; the dead body of young women was found on Tuesday evening in Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosecutor and police informed on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; also an energetic attack at the age of 20 , he was also regarded as he did to study and investig@@ ators to the discovery of the body . &quot;
&quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported on Sunday morning , after arriving at home on the eve of a autumn rock in Rock@@ house ausen , as agreed upon . &quot;
&quot; when searching for the young woman , investig@@ ators climb to the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; when question@@ ing in the friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing group , a susp@@ ect in the twenty @-@ year old . &quot;
&quot; the suspected perpet@@ rators brought the police then to a channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the bodies had been found . &quot;
&quot; thus , according to the official authorities , the authorities were saying that 16 @-@ year @-@ old were killed and the police have put in the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 year old should be led to the Haf@@ el@@ ight on Wednesday , investig@@ ators put him burden to death . &quot;
conclusion concerning the circumstances of fact should bring together the further investigation .
refugees need accommodations : study paper against vac@@ an@@ cies
the location in the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees seek a affordable stay .
pressure on the housing market grows .
the social housing is facing a challenge .
the will of power in the German housing market have long begun long ago .
&quot; with the upcoming refugees and refugees from the EU more people push for a market , already over@@ loaded with many cities in large cities . &quot;
they compete with income @-@ income citizens in the last affordable housing .
&quot; to meet the demand for affordable housing , we have to have expected 400,000 new units by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; to this outcome , a study on behalf of the civil society &quot; social housing &quot; will be announced . &quot;
&quot; for comparison : in Germany 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany . &quot;
&quot; hence , 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing . &quot;
refugees are not oblig@@ ated after the first three months of their stay when asylum seek@@ ers live in a week of initial accommodation .
many of them stum@@ ble onto the flat market and rows in the long queu@@ es for rent .
&quot; however , according to the Federal Office of the Federal Office , however , less than half of all the asylum seek@@ ers have to rent . &quot;
but the housing market &apos;s negative development is not only in rising refugee camps .
the study also accounts significant reduction in residential development policy of recent years .
Germany has a settlement deficit which is greater from year to year .
&quot; at present , Matthias Günther , author of the study , has been involved in the metrop@@ olitan areas in the metrop@@ olitan areas . &quot;
&quot; for many years , they lived in large cities in large cities . &quot;
young adults remained un@@ voluntarily because of the vac@@ ate on housing market more in &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
&quot; in the big cities , the number of square metres per capita has been decreased for the first time in recent years . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social Hom@@ age &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; in this regard , new inc@@ enti@@ ves should stim@@ ulate the social structure of housing . &quot;
so the under@@ under value tax could be wai@@ ved and the base tax of funded apartments could be suspended .
&quot; moreover , according to an alliance , they will be necessary automatically @-@ to @-@ see functions . &quot;
the state @-@ group of the state bank Kf@@ W has already been working well in cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start was , on Monday evening , with 184 million euros , more than half of the approximately 300 million euros have been ab@@ orted . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could even be sho@@ cked . &quot;
refugees have free money in the country : Croatia and Slovenia follow
&quot; after Hungary , virtually no one comes out , there are more refugees crossing the way to Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces that through Slovenia to the north without a hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate Slovenia about the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian Minister for Internal Affairs , and when it is necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister , Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is divided between Croatia and Austria and is already a Schengen area .
the EU country for Croatia is not a Schengen area .
&quot; after the extermination of the Serbian border , hundreds of refugees are broken down to Croatia to reach Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; about 500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ari@@ nik , report to the Croatian TV RTL Television . &quot;
Hungary had sealed its border to refugees in the day before .
laws which entered into force on the same day are virtually superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to happen the refugees .
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ anovic stated : &quot; they can go through and we are preparing for this possibility .
&quot; those people there are women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , people who do not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police arrested the first fug@@ iti@@ ves in Serbia at the border of Serbia . &quot;
&quot; most of them are according to media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they arrived both by bus and taxi in the Serbian Border town of S@@ id .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia . &quot;
on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border the refugees arrive not at the border f@@ ences .
the border strips against other dangers : there are sharp mines there in the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
min@@ ef@@ ields are now to quickly create a secure passage .
&quot; after Hung@@ arians come to Hungary , scar@@ c@@ ely more refugees arrive after the closing of the border . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police had 3@@ 66 en@@ cro@@ oked people . &quot;
shortly before Tor@@ te on Monday there were 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws measure the over@@ coming and damage of the border dispute as an off@@ ender .
&quot; in the south @-@ Hungarian border town Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated . &quot;
the condemned and sentenced from prison to five years and the expul@@ sion from the land .
&quot; according to the immigration authorities , on Tuesday he visited the newly established &quot; transit @-@ sitting &quot; &quot; in a total of 94 applications , almost all of them - 93 - most important transition from R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; under the applicant , 13 families with small children and two older people exist . &quot;
on Wednesday morning 40 refugees could still be stopped there .
&quot; practically speaking , nobody has granted any more view in Hungary to be granted asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; after Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot; &quot;
the treated asylum seek@@ ers should be deported there .
&quot; before the &quot; &quot; tran@@ sect &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke only few hundred refugees came together . &quot;
&quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to cut down . &quot;
they gathered the gar@@ bage to leave the tens of thousands of people over the past weeks .
pl@@ ywood were exploited and one of the recording @-@ in camps in the border was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express themselves to the goal of this re@@ building .
&quot; after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary , only a few refugees arrive . &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; as a consequence , the 20,000 migrants continued to hide themselves in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the drive journey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , train traffic to Germany was stopped by German authorities on the morning . &quot;
located in Freil@@ assing and made regular groups of refugees walking by walking .
Mayor of the &quot; Gestapo &quot; about the border
&quot; we were engaged after the bridge on Sunday with the premises when ten people with travel public@@ ans stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ one Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot;
tourists arriving by train to Pass@@ au .
&quot; because Germany was surprising because of the refugee @-@ stro@@ ma the train line with Austria was un@@ expect@@ edly due to the refugee camp in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; said Stad@@ ler who immediately offered his assistance and the ro@@ oted along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border to Na@@ he Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; before the first guests have stayed only once , with J@@ ause and Be@@ verages . &quot;
&quot; we said the same way , we bring them to Pass@@ au by car . &quot;
&quot; that was self @-@ evident for us , &quot; as Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man had not allowed to take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; that was really happy , &quot; &quot; the city council . &quot;
&quot; the marked train passengers were switched on Sunday evening in Wels from a ICE in a train route heading for Pass@@ au , in order to be postpon@@ ed after the short @-@ term public announcement that the railway traffic was stopped after Germany , yet again on the border . &quot;
but the train was stopped at the border with W@@ ern@@ stein on the river Inn .
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , cross @-@ border is generally higher in the course . &quot;
&quot; the bridge resistant associated with Bavarian neighbours will be staged on Sunday , a day before a bi@@ bli@@ ster sp@@ orti@@ er - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
&quot; so that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is sending an additional mill@@ en@@ nia to us , a logical result of the apparent phase of it is : &quot;
&quot; instead of helping to help with the creation of structures in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , human@@ ism has officially embra@@ ced the attitude of the Hungarian government in the darkness of National Soci@@ alism . &quot;
unfortunately the remains of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confron@@ ted in the border areas with cha@@ otic conditions .
&quot; the poultry have also to be pointed out , that the &quot; praised country , &quot; which they invited and welcome , has nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a major challenge , given the sustained refugee flow and the drawing competition , giving us a decent living conditions for seeking protection . &quot;
&quot; and there will be another bigger , peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad on the search of 35,000 , fixed Qu@@ arti@@ ce &quot;
&quot; Konrad , having fully signed up all hands to refugee traff@@ icking all hands . &quot;
Christian Konrad is as usual that his word has a weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen @-@ ban@@ ker to close quarters for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first open center of Tra@@ is@@ kir@@ k has already gotten a grip on Konrad .
&quot; we didn &apos;t know any homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he claimed from his first success . &quot;
&quot; the interior of 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was also without a major action , &quot; said Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; Master@@ performance . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of the Interior , however , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ free situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , Konrad calcul@@ ates having a need of 8@@ 5.000 quarters in a rough year . &quot;
&quot; in order to fulfill the number , 35,000 accommodations are required in the coming weeks - 20,000 is to provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s no barrel without the ground , &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
&quot; with the state officials , he had already held interviews . &quot;
they could have backed him even for the upcoming refugees of Qu@@ arti@@ ere .
&quot; it is good in Lower Austria , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , who will be clari@@ fied as the church will help . &quot;
great expectations reveals the asylum coordinates as well as the ORF @-@ Action &quot; Hel@@ ping like us . &quot;
private individuals can offer un@@ complicated accommodation on the platform .
&quot; in addition , it hopes to be vac@@ ant on hotels in winter . &quot;
Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for the housing as &quot; very high &quot; yesterday .
in emergency times it cannot be that qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ature must have to hold a certain level of hands @-@ holder or size .
for a temporary time means &quot; emergency standards . &quot;
&quot; unlike the Ministry of the Interior - in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior - , Konrad and his experience proves to be successful . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gent@@ leman , who is not ignor@@ ant of this regard . &quot;
convic@@ ting power is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er cause the Republic to cause any cost as they explained .
their number of employees is to increase their number to three to four .
the own qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ving was not successful yet .
Konrad tried to store a container at st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz @-@ office .
but there is obviously problems with approval .
Linz requires a better division
first no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees in the City of Linz .
&quot; at the moment no need is necessary , because people are currently using without taking these measures , &quot; says Walter Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for an emergency , however , further sites are planned to be examined . &quot;
&quot; criticism , conducted by the local representative in the distribution of refugees within the Federal State . &quot;
other districts have to be felt here .
See@@ hofer : &quot; borders are not dis@@ sealed &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone session with the Bavarian prime minister Horst See@@ hofer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) hosted another action in the refugee problem on Monday . &quot;
See@@ hofer assured me that the German borders are not dis@@ sealed .
the transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic should continue to be possible .
&quot; however , there is the corresponding border controls . &quot;
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany .
&quot; however , the protection @-@ seek@@ ers would be brought with regular trains to Germany . &quot;
&quot; once more stepped out from the other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger once again requested greater solidarity in the refugee problem . &quot;
&quot; that , in Austria , Austria also controls controls on its borders , is for pel@@ hr@@ inger , &quot; a logical consequence &quot; from the beginning of the Germans . &quot;
next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
the general election of the &quot; New Ship@@ yard &quot; at the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially complete .
&quot; the publicly tra@@ ded IT Group S &amp; T ( 2,@@ 700 square metres ) is set to be rented in four of the six floors of office and production buildings , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) is to be rented in young , innovative companies from the technology area . &quot;
&quot; the smart heads are our raw material in the IT - and we must try working for us , &quot; says S &amp; T chief Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he could imagine to invest in start@@ up companies from the New Ship@@ yard and later also to be acquired .
&quot; as early as from the beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - which is rather promising : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; from S &amp; T , 1.7 million euros have been invested in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ center , which is one third of the City of Linz , Austria , Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is from Linz AG for 60 years on S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ center .
30 percent of the 2700 square meters of the space in the building are already rented for an additional 40 per cent of requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the arcade
Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are at the heart in the new shop .

&quot; this project had to de@@ fer the 49 year old daughter of Li@@ a Per@@ oni into the Tau@@ ben@@ z @-@ arcade final : finally , she now has an increase in the form of another business . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ shop , opposite the business in which she sells hand@@ bags , bags , shoes , and clothes of various manufacturers , now everything is about to have a hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets from 75 Euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; before , several weeks later changed . &quot;
&quot; but , for a long time , I have passed if I want to open a shop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the decision was also decisive for the decision that also the fur@@ la producers , which are at home in Bologna , have also been sold by the idea of a company &apos;s own site , where only its hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only one in the great region of Linz , that sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , which even has Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has been placed by her mother in the cra@@ dle .
&quot; at most , when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices . &quot;
&quot; why so many women looking for a beautiful hand@@ bag in sli@@ pping tool , also the specialized lady can not answer with final safety . &quot;
&quot; well , it is due to the fact that a beautiful pocket calcul@@ ates each out@@ fit . &quot;
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , the oldest ancest@@ or of Donald Tr@@ ump , came from a place called An@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; this property is also connected to the billi@@ on@@ aire , president of US President . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always working for excitement .
&quot; whether it expresses himself to a foreign host@@ ile , journalist and knowledge g@@ aps in the international crises policy - the candidate for the presidential campaign goes vig@@ or@@ ously aimed at the presidential campaign . &quot;
and accurately cuts off .
&quot; this will also be registered in the el@@ aic Roman city , where the grand@@ parents reach the property of the property . &quot;
the New Yorker with the F@@ öh@@ n@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is a lot in the wine village on the wine road .
various in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants place is related to -@@ zig corners with him related .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign . &quot;
the post @-@ urban woman Simone Wen@@ del has shot a film about Tr@@ ump .
what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think you &apos;ll find something exciting , but in her K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ter fashion we are not so deeply impressed , &quot; Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has filmed a am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous spr@@ ints where Tr@@ ump is also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
&quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to word in Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt ( 2014 ) , so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he didn &apos;t put it to the king of the heart .
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , there is respect to the performance of the family , but also den@@ sely the opinion that Tr@@ ump is already a bit of his mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; acci@@ dentally I listen to the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the area , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - at Hoch@@ german : the timer , she says . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump happens , therefore , from the village of the legisl@@ ature . &quot;
&quot; the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the subsequent father emigrated , and in the USA opened a local for gold dig@@ nit@@ aries . &quot;
foundations of property management were first basic sales in New York .
&quot; but the life of grand@@ parents were not free of tragedy : her wish , to return to the homeland , was failed on the Bavarian State , which belonged to the Palat@@ inate . &quot;
&quot; he did not shoot tr@@ ump because he was once ra@@ yed without hom@@ olog@@ ation , had the Director of the Institute of P@@ hal@@ ian History and Eth@@ no@@ graphy , Roland Paul , to film start . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
that is in contrast to the included statements of the desc@@ end@@ ents .
he had repeatedly spoke about Mexican immigrants in the United States and asked the construction of a border to deter those immigrants .
&quot; such as the pol@@ arity , which is not so pleasant , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a native of Tr@@ uman ( The O@@ ma was a native tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ ancing , &quot; he is always so cr@@ ammed . &quot;
do you believe that Tr@@ ump happens ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine this , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he has never looked around K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension econom@@ ist Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm menti@@ ons like many kis@@ ses that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz donated to a visit to the church organ which was generally good .
&quot; that &apos;s why I can &apos;t imagine the Donald , &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it is better , when he does not win the election , because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the days at the time of his grandfather in the US , he would have been as he did , &quot; he wouldn &apos;t have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; &quot; says Win@@ de@@ but@@ cher Sarah Bü@@ hler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; my President is not &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; the grapes are ripe , without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; W@@ end@@ el Film , recently interviewed for the Tr@@ ump , have seen 12 000 j@@ ogging , even in the USA , is awakening interest . &quot;

&quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain@@ e@@ ering gates . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in neighbouring country , the alpine society is responsible for the award of the award . &quot;

the last three agre@@ es : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?

&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah Mack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may possibly have been un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly , who wins the bach@@ elor &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; the woman , who finally landed in the Bachelor &apos;s degree in The bach@@ elor &apos;s degree , has been protected in the main sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three left @-@ left girl will certainly not give away if she &apos;s the one who has received the last rose .
&quot; but as we act with Sarah Mack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows per day before three of them will be checked , you might be given a indication of those who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood continues his lips to the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have left their way out why Wood the perfect man is , and they called his sense of humor , amb@@ ition , mar@@ ital values and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , when the question is posed , &quot; If not you , who should get the last rose ? &quot; &quot; their answers could be destroyed , who won the heart of the bach@@ elor &apos;s heart . &quot;
&quot; Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called them both quickly - except for itself , Mack@@ ay , as the best partner in Wood . &quot;
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship between the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went to the house and ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Sam@@ i &apos;s energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought that it was quite compatible , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet on Earth , it is so much fun to be with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I saw her together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a pair .
&quot; from their point of view , Mack@@ ay told that the house visit last week made it clear that Wood should be &quot; One . &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and my family , it was clear to me that this is obviously not just one game - I am subject to it now , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; when it was asked to choose which Wood should choose , if not she , she was en@@ ig@@ matic . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can tell that , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the left @-@ left girl alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .

some coach would have banned Hay@@ den to the rest of the game when he lost an angel while having lost a dr@@ angel while after his first Pun@@ t Return on Tuesday the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .

&quot; 4 people killed , after police bul@@ lets in demonstr@@ ators shoot at protest@@ ers in Nepal &quot;
&quot; four people , among them a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal when police bul@@ lets suspected in a crowd of people demonstr@@ ating against the proposed new constitution , an officer on Wednesday said . &quot;
&quot; violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ au district , about 175 miles west of the capital . &quot;
&quot; Bish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , Chief Apostle Invest@@ ig@@ ators , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , cast lots of pieces of stones and fire@@ bom@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said , the police have used tr@@ än@@ prim@@ and then fired into the air before they res@@ orted to rubber bul@@ lets . &quot;
&quot; 20 police officers and five civilians were wounded , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear why the g@@ utter sho@@ ots , known from which it is known that they can kill them but traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced as a high rate of death . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ frontation was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nepal as southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ ri@@ mat@@ i say that new provinces , which were formed as part of the proposed new constitution , would decrease its political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the Western Nepal of the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus that they wish to have a State .
&quot; more than 40 people , among them 11 police officers , have been in violent cl@@ ashes since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; being assassin@@ ated on August , the four major political parties signed an agreement that divided the country in provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which was governed by centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new Constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ator has accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legisl@@ ature has agreed to vote on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional law in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;

&quot; Inter@@ est@@ ing , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; System Build , &quot; presented on Monday evening in the urban development committee of the Council of the Council of its plans for the first time . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot;
&quot; under pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP group , pro@@ str@@ ated to investors and the administration of confidenti@@ ality , Ralf Behr@@ ens came down from the system construction management in the offensive : &quot; &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; &quot; he said before the members of the plan and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it &apos;s good to meet all rum@@ ors now .
some ten to twelve million euros of expensive projects have been in discussion since months .
&quot; aerial reactions under se@@ bu@@ den@@ sians who came to the meeting , called the pictures and new details to the desired hotel construction . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , the leader and member of the member of the semi @-@ advoc@@ acy of the semi @-@ tra@@ ilers , pro H@@ ie@@ ve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this becomes a giant en@@ ot@@ z that towers all the others . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , as some other project critic , he fears real leadership through the intenti@@ onal size of the plant would be : &quot; there must be whole lot of bus to get that &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; what is happening on the well one hectare of the former restaurant area , is , however , open . &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; we only need to have an conclu@@ sive concept , &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; because this still l@@ acked , the development plans are still variable . &quot;

Google will start a dou@@ bling donation campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to raise the 11 million US dollars on humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees to over@@ blow the thousands of refugees from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of the donations in his blog .
&quot; instead of rele@@ asing a manager at rele@@ asing the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google member , who had fled to her family in Kabul , she was seven years old , thinking about their personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our trip belonged to many dark stations and bus tours , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and anxiety , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but as the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people are looking for assistance as my family . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit groups providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without limits , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first globally collected donations will earn up to EUR 5.5 million from the collected donations to EUR 11 million .
&quot; Europe is being confron@@ ted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , who has sold more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many escaped from the war torn against Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq , Libya and Libya . &quot;

&quot; for slightly ob@@ sc@@ oring diabe@@ tics , weight loss surgery can be helpful . &quot;
&quot; according to a new study , the advantages of weight loss surgery in easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years . &quot;
&quot; it is too early to say if easily overweight people with diabetes by weight loss surgery live longer than those who are non @-@ surgical treatments . &quot;
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery that wrote an editorial about the new trial in j@@ ama . &quot;
weight loss surgery or Adi@@ pos@@ itas concern surgery use several methods to minim@@ ize the size of the stomach .
they can reduce hunger and lim@@ iting the body &apos;s own capability to include food .
&quot; obesity operations became efficient in obesity operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies were carried out in humans which have diseases in ob@@ ese heart ob@@ ese with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BMI , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people who have a BMI of 30 are considered an ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers examined data from Tai@@ pe@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - gast@@ ric surgery and stomach tu@@ bel@@ ess - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people that were easily overweight . &quot;
the average BMI of those that under@@ goes this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year .
&quot; Not@@ with@@ standing , the BMI in the non @-@ surgical treatment procedures remained approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those submitted to a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes condition revealed it completely and 28 % partially . &quot;
&quot; in the medical @-@ treated group , diabetes inde@@ b@@ ted to only 1 percent in comparison with diabetes and partly with only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ glyceri@@ de and a &quot; poor &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , found the authors . &quot;
&quot; the researchers overs@@ aw the patients blood levels of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels in the course of time . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is kept best below 7 percent , the researchers adopt . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level declined by around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , in the medical treatment group it remained stable at around 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease the mortality in five years , so the Chief Editor Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compared the average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ rec@@ tom@@ y group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching bigger recur@@ ring losses in the BMI ( 7.4 vs. 5.1 % ) and pul@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and posted a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are notes from a study of heavy human beings in Sweden , that surgery will lead to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was subjected to ob@@ ese people suffering from an obesity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die during the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it would be cal@@ ming for individuals with a BMI of 35 which are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation in this lower BMI group is lower , &quot; without an increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient lies with his BMI between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we wait too long until we take people to take it seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have settled their bodies with obesity and diabetes , is a revers@@ ing really hard . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück
&quot; it is a theme that is currently widespread in the fiction : a young woman , becoming quite popular and imm@@ en@@ vis@@ ually , meets the flock of her youth , and this is in love with her . &quot;
&quot; so also in the recently released Roman &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally , we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ ur@@ er readers , because he plays in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and the surrounding locations . &quot;

it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe could not take up all refugees , the Dalai Lama promised that the real solution was the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leaders urged to end violence in the refugees of the refugees .
&quot; the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , which is dedicated to ethics studies . &quot;
&quot; he demanded that among the given conditions , the interests of humanity are to be set before the interests of the individual nations or even continents . &quot;
&quot; it also emphas@@ ized that the response to the West European countries could ad@@ mi@@ red during the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; although the Dalai Lama in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts led by the crisis , he emphas@@ ized that there was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful but in the meantime , you need to re@@ think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he under@@ scored . &quot;
&quot; in fact , we must think about how the killing is reduced in its countries . &quot;
we have to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; violence has never solved these issues , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s actions after the September 11 terrorist attack , reve@@ aling that the USA violent action brought a chain of un@@ control@@ able events . &quot;
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem is in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his moti@@ fs were good , but he adopted violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase from taking hanging disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
&quot; poison control centers in the United States have an almost 400 percent increase in number of children under the age of twelve , which swal@@ low alcoholic beverages , the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues of disinf@@ ection technologies in children under 12 years , increased level control centres , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are increasingly being more common to these products , and unfortunately , a percentage of them go in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children do disinf@@ ect@@ ant drink , while some are doing to im@@ press her friends or for a taste of the social media . &quot;
for videos on YouTube will show how young disinf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a budget experience .
adolescents reported to have disinf@@ ect@@ ant with non @-@ alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash which maintain a harder drink .
younger children can be drawn from attractive fragrance of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the wellness systems ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those that are par@@ amount .
&quot; there are disinf@@ ect@@ ant with straw@@ berry , grapes and or@@ ang@@ ul@@ du@@ ets , which are very attractive for children . &quot;
disinf@@ ection products contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
particularly with children very few sy@@ ring@@ es can result in alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ P@@ ruf@@ Center at the University of Kansas , Sender Fox 4 in K@@ ansa city . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let s@@ no@@ ck whis@@ ky around , but people let these hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants reach their reach of children , and when children come on it then it is a fast way to consume much alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es of following straw@@ berry du@@ ft@@ i disinf@@ ection equipment at school , was brought into a emergency department . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol level was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally considered to be drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated them at G@@ win@@ net Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ wan@@ sad@@ ly laugh@@ ed her words and was not able to walk when she arrived in the emergency department .
&quot; doctors guarded her overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma because the girl had fallen by the alcohol and pushed the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; this was frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ bis &apos;s mother , CNN . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
&quot; Lop@@ ez has parents and teachers recommended to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants , to be stored outside the child &apos;s range . &quot;
over alcohol pois@@ oning were some disinf@@ ect@@ ants associated with fat@@ alities .
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died under the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ection apparatus that ab@@ stain@@ ed a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities susp@@ ect that the product me@@ thanol contained , a fatal solution instead of eth@@ ylene alcohol , which was recorded as an active substance . &quot;
&quot; in January scheduled three pupils in the fourth class went to the state of New York to pois@@ oning her &quot; &quot; doctr@@ ines &quot; , &quot; as they lay antique products around the class@@ room , &quot; says a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic against hanging disinf@@ ection . they famili@@ arized them out of their room .
the police looked at the trans@@ duc@@ ted plan as &quot; D@@ w@@ ät@@ z &quot; and rejected the disciplinary measures to the school .

&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland , they are no more highlights of Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people don &apos;t just talk about the return of the leaderboard .
they talk about the old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old Fir@@ m games , and there are not only those in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;

&quot; I know , it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry , or sad about what happens . &quot;

&quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while they rise in the UK . &quot;
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged during the period of May @-@ July at 16@@ 4,000 while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment quota , out of 5.@@ 9 percent , was 5.5 per cent , according to the figures for the National Stati@@ stical Office ( ON@@ S ) . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , jobs in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 . &quot;
&quot; during the quarter of the quarter , the unemployment rate for Scotland decreased to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;

why can I be wit@@ ness@@ ing the execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; a bit later , except for an earlier legal intervention , I will see how a man is put to death . &quot;
&quot; if it happens , and I hope it &apos;s not going to happen , I will sit in an audience of spectators at the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary if Richard Glos@@ s@@ p is executed through the poison injection . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
&quot; the invitation was first made for the first time in January by his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; as the day draws near@@ er , I began to fear myself . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agree , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and there are often more applications to be available , there will be a ma@@ com@@ er lot@@ tery place to decide who is selected . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma reduced the number of media places from 12 to five .
who will be selected it will keep moving emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
&quot; in addition to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps eng@@ ined friend , I will sit on my own relationship with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often have a lot of time when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to record a not@@ ebook &amp; pencil to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
he was accused of a journalist in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma on Twitter to im@@ pose my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it , and you will receive access . &quot;
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; she spati@@ ally acknowledged that she could have imag@@ ined it , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong , what I do . &quot;
Richard Com@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I have said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it . &quot;
&quot; I told him , that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time . &quot;
but he wants to be present an international reporter there to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement of the death sentence . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a reporter from the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post office , is sitting next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the event , please hear the show of Podcasts that I made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go to all details again .
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would ple@@ ad him to be a benef@@ ici@@ aries of murder .
but I believe that a strong li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I think it is not enough evidence to justify a death toll .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and I will see him from this perspective .
I can not claim to be really objec@@ tively .
there will be other rep@@ orters for whom you can turn in for this .
&quot; what you get from me is what it means to die a man of unnecessary death . &quot;

&quot; he targeted at the ste@@ wards and the integration department of Racing Victoria and held that they took a personal campaign against him with the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw hi@@ ther@@ m on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy said , Fair@@ fax media that he always tried to do what is best for racing sport and he himself found himself in difficult conditions than it did not explain the positive cob@@ alt @-@ t@@ up@@ a at Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had kept himself back in 18 months because of the spy , and did not want it to look like it is too high . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I &apos;ve been eating for a long time , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out suddenly &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
they know it continued .
&quot; sometimes it is re@@ acted , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with them what I said . &quot;
I &apos;ll go home this evening and sleep well .
&quot; I want to take your head leading , and I want my owner to think that I &apos;m trying my best . &quot;
&quot; if they start to think , I do not practice it , then I should not be a coach . &quot;
&quot; I then have to consider , what I do with my license . &quot;
&quot; previously , Moo@@ dy had predicted the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com so that the integrity department has tried to sp@@ ell his stable . &quot;
&quot; eight months ago , Terry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart , in a room with a man - whom I will get asked - and offered him an employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they seem to be revealed that I am a che@@ at .
&quot; if that &apos;s the case , they should certainly establish itself upon their n@@ oses because they have failed to reconc@@ ile me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , eh@@ em . chairman of Route L , David Moo@@ dy , re@@ ig@@ ning President of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of Route L , were still conscious of this and are still today . &quot;
should it take me to mind that it is personal ?
has the RV@@ L has triumph@@ ed within and makes people responsible outside train@@ ers what is going on in the branch ?
am I poor for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking out there I am .
&quot; perhaps they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say it is thinking about it now . &quot;
&quot; but I am at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and p@@ ushing them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the ski @-@ l@@ ayed levels of the train@@ ers have taken up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examinations at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching had led to him that he could &quot; cast his license over the table . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known by its preparation of the complete M@@ eist@@ ic Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race &apos;s everyday treatment rule , &quot; after a package lu@@ dge or clay was applied to the legs . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of motor@@ sport .
&quot; I have to take over full responsibility , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees is attached mud on the leg , unfortunately . &quot;
it could have been like that night .
&quot; it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was the case . &quot;
but it was also so on the racing day .
Moo@@ dy might be confron@@ ted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack in the race day . an inquiry into that matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who pose these rules don &apos;t know anything about the horse .
&quot; we all see you we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
man after driver cur@@ ses arrested

the cycl@@ ist was delivered to the Royal Melbourne hospital with serious injuries after arriving from a car on Saturday morning on the Murray @-@ Valley Highway .
&quot; the police told the driver to stop , without stopping , to help the injured rider . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , a 50 @-@ year @-@ old man from Nath@@ alia appeared to the police in She@@ p@@ part@@ on . &quot;
he is expected to be charged with driver cur@@ ses and failure assistance due to other traffic dynamics .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy will fight against rival for claims to come ahead
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the Tac@@ x of his player as &quot; Agenda @-@ S@@ etting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee of the Storm @-@ Player to &quot; compete &quot; with his team during the high Storm victories in the qualifying finals in Sydney will be allowed on Friday night .
&quot; Brisbane Bron@@ cos trainer Wayne Bennett made a hardly conce@@ aling remark of the Storm @-@ Team , after winning the Final victory against North Queensland Co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game an &quot; pattern by the Rug@@ by League &quot; and said that the two from Queensland would not be &quot; too good &quot; at R@@ ingen . &quot;
Bell@@ amy defended the tor@@ ch of his crew and said they have just been &quot; concentrated &quot; when tac@@ kling tac@@ kling her &quot; contact . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers in his team are confident , knowing that they were worried , they were worried by the Storm @-@ Team . &quot;
&quot; that turns out again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring games , when they said to us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our def@@ ensive system or the techniques all year . however , during the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es a real focus , and that has provided us the turn@@ around . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he &apos;s probably not used to get used to it , so it was a bit of shock for him . &quot;
it &apos;s funny as it shows that time again at this time of the season .
Bell@@ amy has attacked the idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and its ment@@ or reminds you that Benn@@ et@@ aker St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra dra@@ gons won the premi@@ er league in 2010 with &quot; real &quot; football .
Wayne says of exciting football .
he was compared on Saturday evening with our Friday night and how exciting their play was &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was one boring team , and Wayne made that he will take care of a cra@@ ck date . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play , and which we look as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
being the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of player .
&quot; he made this saying in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of soccer - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play as these . &quot;
I build stronger bol@@ dness because they are saying these things because they are a little concerned to play against us .
six weeks ago they haven &apos;t thought about us when it went to the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm vs. Roo@@ ster acceler@@ ates higher result than the game Bron@@ cos about co@@ w@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but is that exciting game ? &quot;
or are there any points and has no points of cl@@ amping ?
for me it is the plans .
&quot; once they mention , it means that we will be able to meet in one phase . &quot;
&quot; the Storm team has released this weekend , as they &apos;ve won the right , either North Queensland co@@ w@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I park . ticket sales will start next Tuesday morning . &quot;
Serbia kick up with $ 200,000 Guaranteed on drug abuse . &quot;
&quot; a man who could possibly be a li@@ fel@@ ong punishment because of his death , to possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , who were mu@@ g@@ aged to Queensland , was released against a $ 200,000 deposit . &quot;
&quot; Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and joined in Co@@ om@@ era in August . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was noticed how he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the course of the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a potentially life sentence for an attempt to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic argu@@ ed that it was no proof that he tried to possess the entire amount and that in the café could have been quite a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; judge of the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the floods of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with the pro@@ claim , he lied to the police on his position . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ eable mother and step@@ father was offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ id@@ av@@ its of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a 200,000 dollar &apos;s security represents a real financial burden , &quot; judges Flan@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that only will not suff@@ ice to hold him away from it , he war@@ n &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he ab@@ ort his Australian and his Serbian passport , arriving at the police daily and holding an cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
fatal accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : leadership takes apart
&quot; in a dri@@ ve@@ way with three trucks on the express@@ way 5 at Karlsruhe , a car@@ bide driver was severely injured on Tuesday night . &quot;
two of the three involved trucks had bra@@ ked at a permanent site in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late and tried to escape in vain , in the last moment just to avoid the police . &quot;
the head of accident involving the accident would be complete .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to co@@ draw P@@ ped@@ oph@@ ile to sending pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 year @-@ old girl to ask images of child abuse .
&quot; Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g accepted the phone of the girl when this slept , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ chan@@ ted pictures of children who were sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
&quot; she gl@@ anced through , found the conf@@ using messages and al@@ im@@ pover@@ ished their mother immediately . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five pictures , analyzed then computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research , used to search for un@@ specified pictures of children . &quot;
&quot; then , H@@ og@@ g claimed to have claimed that he would have done it as to &quot; &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile on the Internet &quot; &quot; and he gave &quot; &quot; to be a polic@@ eman , to be start@@ led . &quot;
the public lawyer E@@ ili@@ ie Robertson told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a ad@@ diction that he is ho@@ oked to start@@ le people .
&quot; he said that searching were done on the computer of him , but he said it was going to be , because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten to ped@@ oph@@ ile . &quot;
&quot; he was asked for his talks with the uni@@ denti@@ fied person who sent him the images , and asked him to send any more photos . &quot;
he said he did it to co@@ ax it .
&quot; he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wants to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Robertson Smith added : &quot; when the girl found out the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on trem@@ or and weeping . &quot;
she then saw the in@@ consistent pictures on the phone and confron@@ ted the def@@ endants with them .
&quot; the girl was interviewed and said that the accused was using computers and Play@@ station to talk to girls who looked much younger than him . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ dee , pleaded guilty in the meaning of the indictment , to have abandoned images of children on the 14th of June that year , and not before the court at a hearing on 24 March this year appeared . &quot;
Defence attorney Gregor S@@ im asked about that H@@ og@@ g could not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders because one would argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; in its case may be found .
sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael suggest the verdict of up to October to receive background reports of social work .
&quot; in this case , H@@ og@@ g was granted in this case but was kept in provisional custody for hear@@ ings to others . &quot;
he was still enrolled in the judgement of the judgement on the records of sexual abuse .
tungsten soft on small border crossing to Germany
more refugees will be accessed up from large control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many slo@@ es made a fear of discovery and proc@@ ession the people prolifer@@ ate on smaller border pat@@ rol@@ s

&quot; on Friday , the Sun leaves the sun again longer . &quot;
the mass makes it : every two years the motor series will show their novel@@ ties at the International Motor Show .
&quot; above all , especially on the compact cars , it is particularly well @-@ selling . &quot;
&quot; cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new appro@@ vals were accounted for by the Federal Office of the Federal Office ( KBA ) , in August alone . &quot;
&quot; this is reflected at the IAA ( Public@@ ation , September 17 to 27 ) . &quot;
&quot; this year , many new compact models are presented between all the fut@@ ur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars . &quot;
one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German car industry is the Opel Astra line @-@ up at dealers in the fall .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann to be on the ground . &quot;
he belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order to ensure the volume of the volume is sold well , the new Astra is also not much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel has an entry in the highest compet@@ itor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra costs 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is available with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse range includes more diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which for the first time also include three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines . &quot;
&quot; the Opel Astra sets the Opel Astra course just a fifth , unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus . &quot;
&quot; as a second variation I &apos;ll follow the station of Kom@@ bi , which is already visible at the IAA motor show . &quot;
and what will the Astra up to new ac@@ compli@@ ments next to the Astra ?
Renault Mas@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ compet@@ itor to the race .
at the fair the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively sold as one @-@ door in a conventional and st@@ resses vig@@ orous GT version .
&quot; enter the trade at the beginning of the year , then also as Kom@@ bi . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : all new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan off@@ shoot aims to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; this compact , Infin@@ iti style , fits into the brand &apos;s design line . &quot;
the basic model is equipped with a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
&quot; Suzuki Bal@@ m : new in the segment too is the Suzuki St@@ eno , the new world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a new standard 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 HP . &quot;

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres cell is deser@@ ved
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has given a former in@@ mate of the Justice siege of Justice Te@@ gel , which was un@@ touched for months in a little cell . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of her human rights , threatening det@@ ain@@ ees would be eligible for financial compensation when they are accommod@@ ated in too small cells . &quot;
this decision adopted by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
the persons affected could even hope for the judges if they were imprisoned for few days in the confin@@ ed spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successfully landed in Karlsruhe . he was accommod@@ ated in a private cell with around five square metres of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
&quot; after that , the man , who had moved to his attor@@ neys in the relatively flat , found himself in a larger cell . &quot;
&quot; owing to his most un@@ worthy detention conditions , his detention conditions fail against the Berlin country . &quot;
but the Constitutional Judge filed the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appeal and referred the case for the new trial .
they see the man &apos;s human dignity .
Kammer@@ ral Tribunal therefore decides about the amount of the compensation
&quot; although legal reasons for the period of just a few days are decisive for the compensation , a compensation sentence was given . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , it would be to worry of the legal protection of the personality . &quot;
the Chamber has now to clari@@ fy the amount of money damage .
the Constitutional Judge in the past often strengthened the rights of prisoners .
&quot; so they said only in April of a prisoner of damages , because he was imprisoned in the prison cell . &quot;
human un@@ worthy is also a decision from 2011 to ensure the additional cleaning of a cell without separate toilet .
&quot; in addition , on Wednesday , on Wednesday , the Court of Justice had also confirmed a sentence of human rights in a parallel event in November 2009 . &quot;
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had taken place over three months between 15 and 21 hours in an equivalent cell as in the Karlsruhe case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons in Berlin had also hit the headlines in recent weeks .
&quot; prisoners are still being shut down again for 23 hours , aggressi@@ veness , even to monks , should have already come in due to the ten@@ se location . &quot;
&quot; according to the Minister of Justice , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are un@@ occupied due to young crimes charges , 19 are to exp@@ ire in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating that &quot;
immigration of refugees is quite a challenge - the German ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or is determined to embrace her .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers are according to forecasts of the German Federal Ministry for Germany this year , on the declaration of Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to assume one million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) showed shows in view of the unusual challenge determination : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we are creating that . &quot;
&quot; the following survey is assigned to Germany , convey@@ s the following overview . &quot;
&quot; it is needed , according to the demand of 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Germany ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Pest@@ el Institute ) apartments every year , for the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as you have been built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of living space but particularly at affordable housing objects : annual 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social apartments come out from the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly advant@@ ageous apartments to apply for refugees . &quot;
&quot; according to Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) , therefore , wants to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is the fore@@ seen from the point of view of the Pest@@ el @-@ Institute : 80 000 social apartments each year , and the Federal Government must invest a funding in the amount of 6.4 billion per year . &quot;
&quot; in addition to scientists and Federal Minister , scientists and Federal Minister are thought that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in residential construction . &quot;
&quot; according to the Institute &apos;s estimates for labour market and professional research , 55 per cent of the subjects of poultry have been employed in Germany over the long term . &quot;
&quot; but the refugees in Germany would not be asked to have been questioned after their qualification , in order to help them at the entry , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann @-@ Foundation . &quot;
but for the integration of refugees but is crucial if they find work in Germany .
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation of the admission Society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of the immigrants , says Mig@@ r@@ ational researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to the Thr@@ u@@ hardt there has been a political change : from the Employment Law for Refu@@ ge@@ es to Rec@@ ogn@@ ition of Labor . &quot;
&quot; during the course of a job prohibition of asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resi@@ den@@ ces to asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
in the society itself - because of the exhau@@ sting section - mostly the visibility was made possible that refugees should be able to improve access to the labour market .
a big hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing German .
&quot; until now , there is no valid offer of general and professional language courses . &quot;
&quot; in addition , studies show that jobs are most often convey@@ ed by personal contacts . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the building of networks is the Königs@@ weg path to labor integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin school management has found that only a few poultry parents give their children to the day@@ care of kit@@ es , an estimated 10 to 15 per cent : &quot; &quot; for the ent@@ e@@ ager parents &quot; , &quot; says Il@@ ja Kos@@ chem@@ ist , spokes@@ man for youth and family at the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; however , to convince the family from the benefits of the cas@@ ita , the administration views in various languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators are heavily poll@@ uted by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate is trying to increase the training capacity by doing more technical colle@@ ges . &quot;
students without German language skills are prepared in the countries in the class@@ room .
&quot; but they are not always taught by full instru@@ ctors and teachers , but , as in Berlin , also taught by teachers , who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no lack in them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ations from the Berlin school government . &quot;
&quot; the German student organization estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study in Germany . &quot;
&quot; in principle , no state asylum seek@@ ers or Ged@@ w@@ aged are prohibited - the only exception until now Berlin , internal curator Frank H@@ etty ( CDU ) has now abandoned its attitude . &quot;
student ents to make access to the university &apos;s facil@@ it@@ ates .
&quot; if refugees get allowed with a residence permit or for@@ getting any services according to the asylum seek@@ er law , if they start studying . &quot;
the latter in principle do not get an A@@ fr@@ ot@@ ub@@ es as they are not falling under the circle of b@@ af@@ d citizens .
&quot; in order to have lived for four years in Germany , Ged@@ ul@@ led refugees forced to have lived for four years in order to be ab@@ duc@@ ed by B@@ A@@ fr@@ e @-@ Law , from 1 January 2016 these Span@@ i@@ ards were to be shortened to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; however , this financing thing must be closed . Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin@@ s Secretary of State for Science , and the German student movement . &quot;
the students should immediately receive streams .
&quot; Islam will become a major role in the future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is important in identity . &quot;
the state should have gradually adopted the same rights as they have the churches and the existing state @-@ churches @-@ right to develop a new state @-@ religions relation to Islam .
important would also be the creation of an Islamic con@@ voy to take care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
to the right are also obligations .
&quot; thus , the representative of Islam must be in clear contact person and willing to work together with the state in many areas to create giving him certain control options . &quot;
&quot; this also requires will@@ ingness to take heed to religious Fundam@@ ent@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; the chairman of the General Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed the concern , religious conflicts could be carried in after Germany too . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to bol@@ ster this conflict in Germany would immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law from Arabic .
integration will continue to be a lot more today than today &apos;s subject of society .
&quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change the exploitation of discrimination and rac@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; Germany has , though - as a result of European decisions - has been a decade of anti @-@ discrimination , and an under@@ statement in terms of equality . &quot;
&quot; but it is very slow to learn how the NSU @-@ star@@ board show , in the police and authorities , ignored the rac@@ ist motive . &quot;
&quot; the same chances for all : what mig@@ rant organizations and the interests of non @-@ white German already require for long and to under@@ take international agreements as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism prevention , must be made peaceful in the next few years if the country should remain peac@@ efully and take advantage of its new citizens - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; generally , Germany is capable of providing medical assistance to the previously expected refugees , state res@@ oun@@ ding manufacturer Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; for Man@@ - Power and capacities , we accomplish this , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel impres@@ ario . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money has to be flowing into the system . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery , and all the new@@ com@@ ers to the public health tickets . &quot;
achievements might be converted later to federal states .
and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to devi@@ ate as many people with the limited performance of the asylum seek@@ ers .
otherwise we make doctors especially the language barriers .
&quot; so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has been detected , migrants are receiving worse of their disease than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in medical clinics , also in medical surg@@ eries , is required , they are demanding . &quot;
so many refugees have also been helped with more general medical locations in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic look .
&quot; in the form of refugee children , there are much more un@@ processed persons , and the young people go to an HIV @-@ En@@ lighten@@ ment . &quot;
Mont@@ gom@@ ery knows how to cause some other diseases which come to some of the other diseases as far as Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; paras@@ ite case or tuberculosis are not so difficult to see . &quot; and as far as the doctors had been concerned , refugees could possibly be possibly even in sight . &quot;
the Syrians had an advanced education system ; some refugees are even doctors .
&quot; in order to be able to practice , they would have to prove their quali@@ fications and possibly as possible . &quot;
at least half of all in Germany arriving in Germany is psychological abuse ( B@@ SC@@ K ) psych@@ ologically ill : most of them suffer from an post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; Dietrich Mun@@ z , president of the B@@ Pt@@ K , is particularly vulnerable . &quot;
a recent study by TU Munich suggests that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is trau@@ mat@@ ised in Germany .
&quot; whoever is ill at a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffers , among other things , Flash@@ backs caused by breath@@ ability , dizziness , cardi@@ opul@@ ence and death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep , and concentration disorders , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms were chronic , an early treatment is necessary , explained &quot; Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; however , only four percent of psych@@ ologically ill refugees get psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; psych@@ ologically , asylum seek@@ ers in the social are possible to establish a motion for a psych@@ otherapy , however , processing usually lasts several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , medical workers or doctors , who are not trained in mental illness , may decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this frequently lead to defects , says Mun@@ z . &quot;

sim@@ w Robert Mu@@ gabe keeps the wrong statement in Parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs in the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ hurt , but the video of the case spread rapidly over the social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by the members of the Opposition , that they had received anonymous threats and warned them against Mr Mu@@ gabe to Mr Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; last month they had ridicul@@ ed him , and during his speech on the State of the Nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;

&quot; the message comes from a number that will not be displayed , but she has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists after Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; they are warning the members of the Parliament who ends the immun@@ ity in parliament , and soon as soon as they aband@@ on parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot;
&quot; the chef said , who was led by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , was concerned about the dangers for politicians . &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard becomes up to 30.000 jobs
&quot; Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard , is estimated to produce 25.000 to 30.000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings @-@ related efforts . &quot;
&quot; HP is later divided into two publicly tra@@ ded companies in this year , bringing the computer and printer business from his fast @-@ growing company hardware and family business activities . &quot;
&quot; the expected job migration leads to a load of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP added in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; this re@@ structure measures will enable a more competitive and more sustainable generating program for the new Hew@@ lett Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive Officer , will lead to the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise is being smaller and stronger than HP today , and we will have a wide and deep@@ ened portfolio of shops that support companies while the transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned to satisfy the changing needs of our customers worldwide . &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion US revenue and &quot; &quot; will be focused on the provision of previously un@@ ri@@ cher , integrated technology solutions to companies , &quot; such a statement by the company . &quot;
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930 &apos;s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard . the Palo Alto Garage man is &quot; the birth@@ place of Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has a massive restructuring process to handle the return of traditional PCs into mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the second largest PC manufacturers and one of the largest U.S. tech companies worldwide , is the latest in this area based on the conviction that a focused company focused on a better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates keep behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere !
&quot; W@@ enger extend to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September , and unless its rehabilitation are designed according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optimi@@ stic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will be sure to miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer will be uncertain at the European Championship . &quot;
&quot; the great dis@@ grace of this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished last season after a separate Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ ling viol@@ ating , and then returned to its old swing during the pre@@ season . &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury is threatening not the career , &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
there is a bone he was not healing .
this is not a major matter .
this was just an accident .
&quot; it did not stand in connection with his kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries , which he had before . &quot;
&quot; this may be true from purely medical point of view , but as W@@ enger is also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever one player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an un@@ pleasant pattern .
Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd listed 23 different diseases from Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut in six years ago .
&quot; he also played in just 65 of Arsen@@ er , more than 157 lon@@ gs in the last five times . &quot;
the wider image for arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs since 2007 / 08 and recorded most vulnerable days .
&quot; stri@@ cter accepted the potential of a v@@ icious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the po@@ est@@ ing rate during the last season will last . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , if you are back from an injury , you have a normal time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain mar@@ tial force , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will perform a career in the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Arsenal begins his Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on the next Wednesday , and W@@ enger setting itself a rotation within the teams . &quot;
&quot; hello Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey does not travel to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta can be started . &quot;
W@@ enger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need it , a little break @-@ off , &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
&quot; although the Arsenal favor@@ ites are , through group F , Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most important in@@ ti@@ fying effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is un@@ defeated after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has started last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , whereas at the Richter scale was 3,2 . &quot;
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; W@@ enger is that the arsen@@ al made the doctrine of the past season with the champ@@ ions of the Champions League , and remains largely driven by far @-@ far hope , with his management to lead the club to its first European flag . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
it has never worked for arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer . &quot;
friendship Fest : the com@@ edy show that grants us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is evident , particularly in view of how the need for men to open themselves , now is desper@@ ate than ever before , as self @-@ doing among young males over a 15 @-@ year test@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it is three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the problem , Camp@@ aign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ates ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a bad life ) 2015 than the year of a man to ask the aim of seeking the culture in question that men seek to ask them if they need these . &quot;
friendship is the heart piece in the fight to master this challenge .
&quot; a recent study of more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms suggested that when suffering had enough high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; he doubled its chances on recovery . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of intellec@@ tu@@ ally healthy friends dies the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course we have to have friends only , so that friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; the age of communication led by social media , focusing on its style on substance , the in@@ fertility of response is often more important than significant . &quot;
&quot; our digital life have the need to be strong , fun and successful to appear , even though in reality the isolation is predomin@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists say ec@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values : money , image , social status , all at cost in@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship that is persistent in our mental health . &quot;
&quot; as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently stated , money can really not buy luck . &quot;
the thing about friends was that these were the focus on her head .
&quot; every character was not defined by his work , but by its personality , through the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football check in cozy bo@@ ilers and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all that came from the knowledge that men can refer to that , even if they often rest@@ rained , completely their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a staff of telephone past@@ oral care told me , ... &quot; My assignment on people who feel reli@@ ant and ass@@ orted , has really shown me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not in the position to talk to friends .
&quot; old Rede@@ mp@@ an@@ ism &quot; &quot; Come along with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect on how feeling it is perceived as a weakness when you talk about problems . &quot;
&quot; friends is one of the shows that comes in mind , when I try to offer long @-@ term growth mechanisms . &quot;
they clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ si@@ der status about the phone to look back to humans in desp@@ air , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , when you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ ship Festival with which to celebrate the day totally new setting , why do not take your friends at a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you &apos;re going to sit around in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile , just say hello . &quot;
you never know what the difference could make your friendship .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - all 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ ship Festival
Mary hits the PS@@ G to help Malmö and Mal@@ mal@@ ine
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Edinburgh Cav@@ ani on their hits against Malmö .
&quot; in his debut at the Champions League of Tuesday and on Tuesday , PS@@ G helps to take past Malmö . &quot;
here are the play Report and the response to the game .
&quot; angel Di Maria and Edinburgh Cav@@ ani held course , when Paris Saint @-@ Germain launched its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ Park stadium on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G players who brought the French masters on the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions , but afterwards , when Cav@@ ani came to a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and S@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k , Paris also requires a strong start against the Swedish masters , as they do not only achieve the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ laps , but an improvement on its way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , there was no classic game by Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ mov@@ eable hab@@ it in front of the gate . he was later in the game against his home @-@ home team and against the club , with whom he started using his tough career back in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or to win in the Champions League . so it &apos;s a good start to create our opponents , even if there are certain things that we have to be perfect throughout the season , &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; it is a good sign .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret it , we do not have one or another two goals . &quot;
&quot; after his injury in one of three amendments to the Paris @-@ Team , Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to the Paris @-@ Team weekend that a 2 : 2 dis@@ decided in his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was em@@ itted by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ inian wing swi@@ ft was designated as the man , who could take the PS@@ G towards the next level in Europe , when he landed in the last month of Manchester United when he finished in Marco Com@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass behind the Malmö defense , and finished in the long corner of the multilingual network . &quot;
&quot; however , someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a major win , which was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malmö , the Celtic voyage with a play @-@ off , started to reach this level , stepped up with 9 national players on the field and was deeply stir@@ red in the middle field with a five man def@@ ending , and two deep in the middle field . &quot;
&quot; but apart from a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , which goes far to Kevin Carr@@ er P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , offered them little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G itself started sometimes , with some mis@@ chie@@ fs and poor id@@ ities , last but not least by Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who did not last for less than five attempts . subsequently , Cav@@ ani had put him after rest@@ art@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players to the game , and it was a pass from Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , the Di Maria was transformed into a shooting , which was led by Wil@@ and at the pace in the 5@@ 2nd minute ... &quot;
&quot; finally , the second gate finally fell after the hour brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans thus accounted for his sixth part of the season , after Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had put up one left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; that finished all the idea that Mal@@ mo has to return to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from a short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the final result was very low before the subst@@ it@@ ist E@@ ze@@ qu@@ iel Lav@@ e@@ zzi represented a gate in the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later announced that PS@@ G played a class on his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year . &quot;
&quot; since then we have played only in the Swedish league , which did not have the same level . &quot;
the qualifying matches are not enough . &quot;
hat from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented the change from FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi will be playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar for the summer of 2015
&quot; Bayern was obviously just a few years ago , before the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , which was then played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times winner winner , four times champ@@ ions Champions League winner , two times champion Champions League , two times European champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is stunning . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and changed to al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca pro@@ hibit X@@ avi , now he was standing before the time at the Euro 2008 election . &quot;
you told me that Bar@@ ça wants to sell me .
&quot; Madrid won everything we didn &apos;t , &quot; he tells . &quot;
and the registered domain of Bayern .
&quot; avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ saw did not want to have me . &quot;
&quot; in the memory : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the Bayern . &quot;
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi was not changed
but the change didn &apos;t come about .
and the resulting man is working for the German record champion : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explained why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has put Gu@@ ardi@@ ola under contract and I played a great EM .
&quot; P@@ EP has said to me that I didn &apos;t change it , he could not imagine the team without me . &quot;
&quot; he has w@@ rest@@ rained me with this . &quot;
who knows how to run Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 with X@@ avi .
&quot; in the quarter of the Champions League against the Bayern , X@@ avi stood over the entire distance on the lawn , the Red Sea switched off ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the royal boun@@ ty . &quot;
Matt Dam@@ on plays a variety of film sequences
&quot; Matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the af@@ ro@@ US film maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said they will not need behind the scenes . &quot;
&quot; as a consequence of the Sunday night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown signs off when this was the necessity of alternative perspectives and in terms of a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; when we talk about diversity , you do it in the cast of the film and not at the occupation of the show , Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
Brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked by a sho@@ cking un@@ belief and called &quot; HO@@ O ! Wow . okay . &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian settled .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the product line Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - as she will deal with the harmony of Harmony , &quot; Brown first said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and it is a sp@@ line that is beaten by their white em@@ bal@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People , officially amazed by Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for director rights in the film . Dam@@ on said that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ advantages of Dam@@ on comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter followers Mr. Po@@ oni squee@@ zing his anger over the clip by saying &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space , so he can explain its diversity - this is SO W@@ ed that we hurt . &quot;
&quot; twe@@ ets has earned more than 5,000 ret@@ ard@@ ets and 4,000 likes since its release . &quot;
the comments come at a time in which the exact r@@ att@@ ling representation in the media is at the head of social discussion .
&quot; when te@@ ens Michael Brown was killed by a white police force in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement became nationwide and armed groups and authorities , discri@@ min@@ ating practices against partner &apos;s laws . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince had issued a match during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards . &quot;
&quot; albums were silent , ( records still have their mean@@ ings ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , records are still on their significance . &quot;

&quot; the competition Show , which completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participants who finished all stages of his obst@@ acle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Cameroon H@@ off Brit@@ ten until the finals . &quot;
&quot; on the final task , climbing on a 75 ft long climbing rope in 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time that he ended the first Ath@@ en@@ during , which ended the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American nin@@ ja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge in full three seconds faster which made him winner . &quot;
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after hard fought win and still under shock over the profit of the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; I mean it is ast@@ oun@@ ding to think about it , I have never earned over $ 10,000 or for life , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! through his he@@ ap money . &quot;
so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how that &apos;s ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed served with The Hollywood reporter in order to discuss the final and why British , although he was first of the first course , does not plan any prize money at any time . &quot;
&quot; according to the rules , money goes to the fastest person . &quot;

he &apos;s just so happy to have done what he did .
the crowds of awards received it from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his wife and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that there is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have just felt the same when they have changed the roles .
America nin@@ ja Warrior has been extended for a season of season and the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit &apos;s Tig@@ ers race at Minnesota T@@ wins
Scotland &apos;s second half of the season was not especially funny for Detroit &apos;s Tig@@ ers .
&quot; earlier they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball . nowadays , the Tig@@ ers are finished in the past place in the American League of Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers have reduced their role as a spo@@ iler , but this part played a perfect match against Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target . &quot;
the T@@ wins w@@ aged a chance to climb up close to Houston Ast@@ ros for the second @-@ American League of Wildlife .
&quot; for Detroit , though only for an evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word , which was so difficult to gr@@ asp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad dem@@ mus . &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon kept his early offensive support as it scored three times in the first two internal groups but once in the sixth and then even at the ninth time .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) spent 6 times in 1 / 3 internal and enabled us three R@@ uns .
there was only his third successful start in his final nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; says Simon . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to throw any game in the bull@@ do@@ zers , and therefore I want to concentrate entirely in the game . &quot;
&quot; the designated Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ B@@ Is in mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three hit hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle navy on July 6 . &quot;
&quot; he has sha@@ ken the bu@@ zz@@ ling well , &quot; said Kitty . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( striking training ) , looked clearly better from the bull@@ do@@ wer and he put it straight into the game . &quot;
with three R@@ uns in the back at the end of the seventh part the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back into the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a colourful mixture and Simon delivered his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the P@@ hin@@ gen Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy left the wall , the only man who was confron@@ ted with which he was confron@@ ted with the design@@ ate ro@@ ok@@ ie , Miguel S@@ ano , which will un@@ veil a Two @-@ Run from the right @-@ handed . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of finishing and finishing the finish in the second , Ver@@ h@@ agen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to play Double Play . &quot;
&quot; it was the 27th time in the Major League &apos;s leading league in this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ phe@@ w will hit Double Play . &quot;
&quot; once inside the ninth month , Detroit added a Insurance @-@ Run in the end of the ninth month , I managed a R@@ BI double versus the C@@ loser of Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the 5 @-@ 4 stand . &quot;
&quot; the right hand of right , however , S@@ ano came out on three Pit@@ ches for its fifth S@@ ava . &quot;
benef@@ itted for the opening of the game by an even un@@ moving Phil Hughes .
&quot; the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two internal gr@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been deleted before the game of the po@@ ison@@ ings list , after having batt@@ led more than a month because of an back suffering . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished me , &quot; said Hughes , &quot; but I felt better when I started to get and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; when they received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first , H@@ ets gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; a two @-@ out walk in J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought together Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z in the play , which made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z made his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right , managed to run a further run but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers laid out in the second one , one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a two @-@ out single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose for the 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; T@@ wins Manager Paul Mol@@ itor said . &quot;
&quot; he did not beat particularly well , but he caught the right spot . &quot;
&quot; in a Hughes @-@ Count , Hughes was in a short walk @-@ Count , and did not score any points in the third inning , before being replaced by the &apos; Rel@@ ie@@ ve right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ ight by the Rel@@ ie@@ ver right hand . &quot;
&quot; at Hughes , three R@@ uns were hit by six hits and a walk with four ke@@ ke@@ outs . &quot;
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal was retired due to injury of the puppies .
&quot; he was investig@@ ating James Andre@@ ws , who was the world &apos;s shoulder from Sanchez in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; Sanchez , since mid @-@ August on the injuries list due to a shoulder @-@ pull , should be activated for the launch on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the signing of the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is kn@@ itted by the po@@ est@@ ine list in order to win against the wins . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was purchased on 30 July in exchange with the L@@ HP David Price . &quot;
he has been pur@@ ged in the right hip joint since 20 August due to a dist@@ ortion .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins are going to end their series of three games in the target field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4@@ 43 ER@@ A ) is played against that of Minnesota &apos;s R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) . &quot;
hundreds of refugees are supposed to arrive in Wiesbaden
one train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hessen .
his arrival was expected to be on Wednesday night .
&quot; the people of Engine@@ ers should then be accommod@@ ated in shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , like the town of Wiesbaden on Tuesday night . &quot;
it reck@@ oned off with 450 to 750 relating to the upcoming refugees .
several sporting activities of the h@@ ess@@ ische provincial capital have been prepared for this case in recent days .
&quot; up to 1,000 refugees can temporarily be subjected to temporarily . &quot;
they will then be distributed to other municipalities .
&quot; in the past ten days alone , according to information provided for the opening of the ruling party in Gießen , Germany , 7@@ 500 people were arriving in H@@ esse . &quot;
Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also furnished accommodations in sp@@ ouses because of the great number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
&quot; the leaders of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for one possibility . &quot;
&quot; I think that dis@@ cont@@ ested thinking about military training options may not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he threw a look ahead of the European states &apos; colle@@ cti@@ veness . &quot;
four years ago it was glad that the cup has passed a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict came down at our front door , &quot; he said in Deutsch@@ land@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for massive rise to international aid for refugees .
Austria controls in southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , the Austrian Minister of Internal Affairs , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , declared on the Austrian TV station ORF . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , no refugees have returned to Austria . &quot;
&quot; no , it has been agreed , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement that could take a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l said , I have already dealt with several discussions between the General Director for Public Security and representatives of Germany . &quot;
the concrete figures were not named and promised in talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; in the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees came across the Balkan Route @-@ route from Hungary to Austria . &quot;
your objective is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann applied for a special summit in cooperation with several other EU leaders for the next week .
Germany had started the temporary border controls on Sunday .
the EU states have so far not been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis .
the EU interior ministers will want to take a new start to the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees on the next Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
&quot; in view of the strong refugee flow in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries increasing with the first up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ federation will jointly pursue this together with the countries , saying , on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hour deliber@@ ations with the Prime Minister , the Chancell@@ ery of the German Chancell@@ ery of Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel stressed that those men , who want to need protection , che@@ w this also . &quot;
but those who have no lead perspective cannot remain in Germany also .
this idea was also expressed in the turn in turn .
the Chancellor stressed that the state was as a whole must have to overcome a &quot; huge strength . &quot;
thousands of desper@@ ate refugees have now been settled on the Balkan Route .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres long border on Tuesday in the night to Tuesday .
&quot; just a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest to exter@@ min@@ ate the border with a fence . &quot;
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent the tu@@ g@@ boat ou@@ rou@@ ters from Romania was Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said to the planned new border .
the Romanian government condemned the plan promptly .
first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , because of the ye@@ witnesses , thousands of migrants follow the way to the Greek border . &quot;
space probe &quot; Cas@@ sin@@ i &quot; takes place on Satur@@ n@@ moon En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
&quot; under the E@@ isp@@ an@@ zer of Satur@@ n@@ moon , En@@ cel@@ an us sn@@ akes a global ocean . &quot;
the researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cas@@ sin@@ i . &quot;
&quot; according to the moon , the moon is slightly restricted to the ring . &quot;
&quot; indeed , this diving movement may only be small but is too big for a well @-@ preserved cel@@ est@@ ial body , called it in a communication by the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca , the U.S. state of New York . &quot;
the researchers con@@ front their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; sheet .
&quot; over the ice cap of En@@ cel@@ an us liquid , it was already known . &quot;
&quot; this way , &quot; Cas@@ sin@@ i &quot; already discovered Eis@@ vul@@ can@@ e on the South Pole of Saturn , in 2006 . Satur@@ n@@ moon discovered the water vap@@ or and r@@ attle in the Saturn &apos;s so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , so astronom@@ ers announced . &quot;
the extent of the hidden ocean was not clari@@ fied .
&quot; Rama is missing several weeks in Munich , Germany &quot;
&quot; the 1860 Munich need a month to be opened in Ram@@ det , France . &quot;
an investigation has given an ad@@ duc@@ tors infr@@ in@@ gement among the 27 @-@ year @-@ old granted to the association .
Ram@@ ah had already compl@@ ains in pain at the beginning of the week .
according to the Munich Li@@ ons the diagnosis &quot; is expected to take four weeks of forced break .
&quot; this is true for us , Rama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot;
&quot; we have to re@@ think of course , &quot; &quot; said Sports director Nec@@ kar@@ ty in the &quot; picture &quot; newspaper with view on the possible commitment of a united society . &quot;
&quot; as a training guest , the six@@ ties therefore presented a def@@ ensive point . &quot;
&quot; the 30 @-@ year @-@ old H@@ r@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and also stood at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg , Germany . &quot;
the Cro@@ at currently has the opportunity to prove his skills .
tor@@ ff Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to team training following his conc@@ ussion week .
even on Thursday the Austrian National player is going to compete in running training .
&quot; in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) , Ok@@ ot@@ ie was injured in a heavy cl@@ ash in his head . &quot;
&quot; contrary to his first fears , he remained without a grave professor . &quot;
no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain much sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
&quot; but those who want to consider his sl@@ ender line , this is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them . &quot;
because Mang@@ os contain relatively high sugar - especially suc@@ rose .
&quot; healthy are the exotic fruits : in them B vitamins , as well as vitamins E and C. especially , are man@@ os , but much Vitamin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or beta @-@ car@@ otene . &quot;
&quot; the fruits , therefore , support the visual , immun@@ ological and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ gos shouldn &apos;t be too soft or too hard and smell . &quot;
the form@@ work color alone says nothing about how ripe one fruit is - so also green man@@ gos can taste delicious .
&quot; they should be kept at room temperature , and within less days . &quot;
&quot; then they taste it , of course , or in sweet foods . &quot;
&quot; in a man@@ go , however , there are a special touch . &quot;
she mil@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of multiple leaf@@ lets like Chic@@ ore@@ e and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
&quot; and a Mang@@ o@@ ut@@ ney fits perfectly with fish , poultry , lamb and wild animals . &quot;
&quot; for the USA , the United States Service is up to 9@@ 5000 equi@@ p@@ ments for the Christmas business . &quot;
&quot; the company has already begun recru@@ itment of seasonal workers , UPS service on Tuesday . &quot;
especially drivers are looked for .
&quot; last year , UPS took up his workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 . &quot;
&quot; in view of the bo@@ oming online business UPS and his compet@@ itor Fed@@ Ex since been ahead of previous year , to be prepared for the Christmas business . &quot;

&quot; first F@@ öh@@ n@@ able , then prominent cold front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alp@@ enn@@ as , the f@@ öhn stops through how met@@ e@@ os@@ ch@@ ant@@ z is leaving on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday and in the night on Thursday the f@@ öhn stops part of the hair dryer , partly with whir@@ l@@ wind breath@@ es . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ öh@@ ning on Thursday morning , we crossed a pronounced cold front , the powerful rainfall , ar@@ ches and a temperature decline . &quot;
&quot; as met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a communication , Switzerland currently stands on the front of an extensive deep @-@ pressure territory over the British Is@@ les in a powerful South West territory . &quot;
&quot; on the night@@ side , at night , the f@@ öhn stops through the valleys in the night . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the f@@ öhn stops on Thursday morning in the gro@@ aned flat with ar@@ ches from 60 to 100 km / h , partly isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly with over 100 km / h . &quot;
the f@@ öhn is able to penet@@ rate the adjacent to the adjacent middle and the mountains are even possible with ar@@ ches of more than 120 km / h ( 120 km / h ) .
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday , the hair @-@ dryer for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees will be sto@@ wed away from moisture . &quot;
here the rain cont@@ ends up until Thursday night .
&quot; in total , the south of the Alps in the next 48 hours , some more than 100 litres of rain per square metre will be reck@@ oned according to some rain amounts of rain during the last days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning , the f@@ öhn stops the air into the hair dryer , in a row a cold front with robust , partly we@@ ath@@ ed rain from west to east on Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; together with the cold front the wind fell heavily up to stor@@ my , and the temperatures are considerably backward . &quot;
&quot; the following days are present in the north autumn with 15 to 20 degrees . in the south , on the contrary , it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
&quot; nearly 500 years after the Reformation , there is now an Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of El@@ na@@ zio Marino , a well @-@ known number of nam@@ eless place in the Park on the Opp@@ io Hill was baptized in the name of the German Re@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; in Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , he is now honoured as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located right in the heart of Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the name was sought by the Protestant Ch@@ urches in Rome by the Protestant Ch@@ urches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , remin@@ ded that the Protest@@ ants could live in the city of the Pop@@ es over centuries as a minority often only in secret their faith . &quot;
&quot; with this place , in a symbolic fashion , the Christian faith in Rome will be welcomed in a symbolic manner . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was considered a young August@@ inian mon@@ k to take the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 during a couple of months .
he recommended the city back then as a disgu@@ sting sin .
&quot; following his negative impressions , he was em@@ bol@@ dened him by histori@@ ans in his later war against Rome . &quot;
Luther then initiated the split of the Dutch Church with his thes@@ es in exile .
hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
&quot; Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Sle@@ eves is one of the main works , made by Ot@@ mar &apos;s Alt for his Bible . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and translations of the Bible .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with splendid pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , the picture was defined for Ot@@ mar Alt , who set out his personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of Bi@@ blical stories in paper and canvas in 150 designs . &quot;
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has the 75 @-@ year @-@ old get - which is by no means equal to &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to particular topics , the quite righ@@ tly dark way can work . &quot;
&quot; since three years , Ot@@ mar Old has worked on his Bible project for which he has had a sub@@ jective artistic selection from the many theme departments of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cycles were made by cycles such as cru@@ den@@ ers , pl@@ agues , commandments , or pat@@ ern@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; he fascin@@ ates spontan@@ e@@ ously to several partners : this is true for the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation , as well as the Kettler E @-@ Verlag with its main emphasis on art books . &quot;
and there is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost who fell on the basis of painting with the respective bi@@ ble quotes .
&quot; he interpreted the Bible records by Ot@@ mar Old , and thus into current relations . &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ al mirror of Al@@ ts paintings .
&quot; they are embedded in the address of the author of Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who has form@@ ulated his own personal thoughts on the respective situation here . &quot;
the ornam@@ ent band has the golden spoon .
so the 75 year old will allow twice a deep insight into his soul &apos;s soul .
this is a high degree of in@@ tim@@ acy .
&quot; emot@@ ion was ultimately exc@@ used for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode ; born in Berlin , comes from a family who heard the strict protest@@ ant master word . &quot;
&quot; since the education came under the tube stock , Ot@@ mar Alt remembers . &quot;
&quot; I tried to re@@ work that , in order to re @-@ carry me again with the Lord my father . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to educ@@ ate art in more animated time : &quot; the perception of imag@@ ery is characterised by advertising , and that is noisy . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is displaced .
artists have another desire and bl@@ iss to show things .
images always have a mysterious and not decorative .
&quot; in this way , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt let us know that the viewer watches and feel &quot; &quot; up &quot; &quot; them to effect on themselves , detect and feel what power they have : &quot; the painting seeks to be over against each other . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost met on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar University Bible in the Ot@@ mar University Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst &quot; &quot; : &quot; I like to understand life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; old , I don &apos;t care to record the Bible completely , but those for him most important , also mysterious themes . &quot;
&quot; that was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; this is about the pictures , the text clearly explained . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ hler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work will be an invitation to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts images speak for fittings both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and fla@@ x pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition which opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt Foundation .
construction work for BM@@ X track
&quot; having taken place , found space to model the company , set up the hills on a circuit : one year later , almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track was finished . &quot;
&quot; a decline in politics and management was made for over , above all for those who would not toler@@ ate the rail@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; thus , hill wal@@ im@@ ed , new place wanted - now with formal planning and application for building permit . &quot;
&quot; the hom@@ olog@@ ation will be in October , the first common shareholders in Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bock from childhood and youth board . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year will happen yet , &quot; she said . &quot;
there should be no more commemorative break with the work during the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B grows its commitment for refugees to 2019 , in particular , the Bundesliga will be show@@ casing an obvious sign of the Bundesliga . &quot;
football react to the spreading situation in Germany and secu@@ res policies to lead the imp@@ aired problems .
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; there can no one say in principle that nothing comes to me , I have nothing to do with that . &quot;
&quot; he must find this very interesting object to handle this topic in the handle , &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang R@@ s@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on 23 September , he inten@@ sively discuss the refugee situation in Germany . &quot;
&quot; I am next Wednesday in the Chancell@@ ery and meet the Minister of State , Mr@@ s Ö@@ zo@@ o@@ uz and Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; then , the theme will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football could and wants to help .
but the decisive moves must do politics .
&quot; for this reason , the German football alliance has thus expanded its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years . &quot;
&quot; for the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Stiftung , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; in the outskirts of the UEFA Conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
even some Bundesliga men support this programme .
&quot; at this weekend , the 36 celebr@@ ities show a distinct character when it takes place on the left tri@@ cot ( Hermes ) to put the name &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we also want to make it clear that all should help where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen sports boss Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler told the project as &quot; self @-@ understanding . &quot; &quot;
&quot; an instant play goes to everyone , nobody can see it away . &quot;
&quot; we wish to be a football team , no , we must use our brilli@@ ance , our influence and our capabilities to help the many refugees who have been so incredibly suffered for help , &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ ders CEO Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent symbol of the league . &quot;
&quot; the Euro 2016 quali@@ fier for Hungary on Friday invites the national team of women 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
Nier@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; a big joint work in German football . &quot;
&quot; that all 36 licenses had started one own projects in their locations , is great . &quot;
&quot; the same is great , that small and smallest associations operate as active . &quot;
&quot; 1 : 0 &quot; The welcome , &quot; which we have spent , is being hosted in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and the next year , the association will jointly provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already declared the whole thing for 2015 , &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot;

&quot; we meet at the Supervisory Board at Wall@@ dorf , in early October , &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is working with the meeting and &quot; fully @-@ fit &quot; meetings .
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , that he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software exhibits . &quot;
&quot; I am full for SAP , I &apos;m full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I stood at the time of regular contact with the Supervisory Board and his chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t &apos;s &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t typically comm@@ utes between Germany and the US , but since the summer he was unable to participate in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such personal story , said the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; manager : &quot; anyone can happen that way . &quot;
&quot; it is important to get up again , if you like . &quot;

&quot; the national player is missing the table leader of the soccer league , in du@@ el with the FR@@ P Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19 : 00 / Sky ) . &quot;

&quot; whether Re@@ us will be part in the Bundesliga match in the Bundesliga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach made open : &quot; we expect a return from it to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high burden of its professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change his pedi@@ gre@@ ens to the Re@@ us position . &quot;
thus he announced a change on the door@@ ke@@ over position .
for this reason Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is participating at the square art@@ ender Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; the soccer teacher praised the world champion . &quot;
&quot; if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller comes to use in all Europe @-@ League games , Tu@@ ch@@ el made it open however . &quot;
in a high li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood he will also make the second game .
&quot; the for@@ mid@@ ring statement of players Re@@ us , that the final train for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europe League must be the goal of comprehen@@ sible even in@@ comprehen@@ sible even in the mid@@ fiel@@ der : &quot; he is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to access the title .
robot@@ ic cars : government wants a ro@@ ader role for Germany
Germany is said to be the German government &apos;s goal to change the car &apos;s technological pioneer .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) which provides investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; on Wednesday at the outskirts of the Fair , Do@@ brin@@ dt addressed a &quot; new mobility era &quot; at the Frankfurt Motor Show . &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less stress , Do@@ brin@@ dt said . &quot;
&quot; he also plans to discuss the subject with his counterpart from the G7 countries , who at the International Motor Show were also coming together with representatives of the industry . &quot;
the strategy paper of the German Federal Ministry is emphas@@ ized by the importance of mobile broadband exp@@ editions and a generous donation to digital radio stations .
&quot; for testing new technology , a test track is currently being carried out on the highway 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; thus , the Federal Government will do no additional dis@@ claim@@ er &quot; &quot; will review the legal framework conditions and , &quot; where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; so , Germany would like to use for it internationally , that the permissible speed limit for self @-@ driving cars of 10 to 130 km / h is raised . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the federal government plans to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only sees people as driver . &quot;
&quot; when automated driving , driving , increases the car , the driver will become more and more to the passenger . &quot;
&quot; technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras , which process the environment and process data in seconds . &quot;
&quot; following a survey by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving can be technically possible by 2020 . &quot;
still driving vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected to go ahead to 2020 .
&quot; the value added value in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving features at location , the authors of the study estimate 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros by 2025 . &quot;
&quot; the digital networking of the vehicle can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said SPD traffic officer S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; the question of liability in accidents and safety of personal data , but needs to be clearly explained . &quot;
even the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
&quot; a study at the AA study by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the Coordin@@ ation Bureau of DE@@ K@@ RA comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail in the next decade and 31 percent do not believe it at all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 per cent of those surveyed by 2025 with autonomous driving cars , accounting for 33 percent . &quot;
anyway the drivers in Germany are not ready to leave themselves completely to a self @-@ driving vehicle .
&quot; after a collection of the digital coma , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; at the free@@ way , there could be no less than 15 percent in running transport , at the St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
good each viol@@ ate would leave the car a control over no circumstances .

&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for a en@@ f@@ ant
it is a mixture of quite a fashion show and a watch@@ men gr@@ ati@@ el@@ et : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday .
&quot; the highlights : display man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which are hop@@ eless thanks to video projections . &quot;
&quot; you wear the spectacular cre@@ ations by the French designer , among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as Stage out@@ fits for the big star of the fashion scene - and thereby , he put males in skirts . &quot;
I can &apos;t say today that I am the en@@ f@@ ant of the Haute C@@ out@@ ure because I have a white hair .
&quot; it was light , in the meantime it &apos;s genuine , &quot; said Gaul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From Citi@@ zen on the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from 18 September at the Kuns@@ thalle of Hyp@@ o @-@ Cultural Foundation , it is a fortunate that the fashion designer has changed its beginning to a look over his person . &quot;
&quot; he was actually admitted that : &quot; for me , it was a bit of death for me , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , one comes to the Museum . &quot;
&quot; the impressive collection had previously created in Montreal , Canada , and in Paris . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is a tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly surprising work of man who has written fashion history without having ever completed an education .
&quot; chron@@ ologically the show is not established , but it is an excellent and chore@@ ograph@@ ed universal artwork , designed for so much effort : to eliminate the d@@ olls , for instance a St@@ yl@@ ist was involved . &quot;
&quot; according to the figures of the Kur@@ ators Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have had 14 tons of material to Munich . &quot;
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest@@ ation was still a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a leather tro@@ user out@@ fit with cork .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he always cares for strong women ( &quot; women are slaugh@@ tering as men &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , Gaul@@ tier said . &quot;
Charles de@@ ers old Teddy was also shown in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , well @-@ known fashion tests of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he put on his Teddy B@@ HS and clothes , Gaul@@ tier said . &quot;
&quot; with a doll to play , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he started designing fashion so later he taught himself .
&quot; he st@@ ole fashion head@@ ings and looked at the designs of other designers , such as Gaul@@ tier in Munich . &quot;
later I bought them but of course .
for his first fashion show he won &apos;t pay the models .
they got nothing but was allowed to retain the clothes .
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ ate top as fashion @-@ niche
it was previously applied to the long stick@@ ers inside and around Pl@@ auen to make meters up .
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and lace worked in large amounts for customers , which they worked on for example ceilings and curtains . &quot;
&quot; the only works today doesn &apos;t work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , the CEO of the screw holes . &quot;
instead the fashion is important .
&quot; in the early times of the pl@@ au@@ ener leader , fashion has played a major role , was then pushed through the Heim@@ tex@@ as and is now re @-@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt gives some examples : top in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and with regional tra@@ des . &quot;
&quot; even proof of the so @-@ called vintage mode , which leans against the past stimul@@ us , an increasing customer potential . &quot;
anyone who has no niche in the textile branch in Germany is not on the market anymore .
&quot; with us , they already make half of all orders . &quot;
Mo@@ chief seats are together with nine other companies in the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener Ho@@ ops and embroi@@ der@@ ies .
only they may bear the protected label .
&quot; over the last 15 years , some 80 percent of sales were destroyed . &quot;
&quot; private specialized stores and wholesale trade , there are almost no more . &quot;
our products can hardly trust our customers in this way .
&quot; nowadays , the mass hardware will be much cheaper today in the Asian region , and almost exclusively sold through chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the exp@@ ort@@ ment of export to Russia and the USA are also vulnerable . &quot;
so there are enough reasons for new routes .
&quot; the industry association also attempts to score points on environmental awareness like C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the embroi@@ dery shop in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have a quality seal , which shows that we produce eco @-@ friendly and soci@@ ally . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; it refers to materials used . &quot;
thesis U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schnee@@ berger office of the Sax@@ on University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alizes in embroi@@ dery and lace .
&quot; to oppos@@ e the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
this takes time and courage .
&quot; a voltage panel is created between the fresh@@ ness ideas of designers and the companies that must remember particularly economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a existing design will often only be varied to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; some years ago , Kat@@ i Re@@ uter spent the historical snow @-@ spe@@ ar@@ head new . &quot;
then the machine embroi@@ dered with some places small ch@@ icks .
&quot; the pl@@ au@@ ener gold medal in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ lt took himself inspired : &quot; before that , I was able to start with traditional pupp@@ y tip . &quot;
now she uses the tops of snow for their jewellery .
&quot; in a extra@@ vag@@ ant procedure , it defines the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people of the region identify themselves with the topic pl@@ au@@ ght - young and old , &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; you can also live in the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers , whose ancestors had been living in places and surroundings and would like to have a mem@@ ento . &quot;
with that I see my jewelry as the modern ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener chief .
Disney is planning a new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; -@@ movie

&quot; however , according to the &quot; Entertainment Weekly , &quot; however , things are not to be a re@@ ten@@ ant , but to continue a sort of continu@@ ance that plays 20 years after the first film with the magical nursery . &quot;

XI constra@@ ints on to open the economy contrary to the world
&quot; the economy must open a wide view out@@ ward to fo@@ ster growth , president X@@ i Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday a group that was t@@ asked with the steering system of the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should use itself to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business premises , &quot; &quot; he said in an address at the 16th session of the Central executive group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; to encourage new businesses and reform , new vibration and vitality can lead to new economic growth and said X@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the guide Group has adopted a series of directives , including a negative list to regulate the market access , Rel@@ ax@@ ation of border controls policies , to the private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the population @-@ based system . &quot;
&quot; according to the statement , a negative list has been created , the sectors and enterprises that have not come into question for investment . &quot;
the system is tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance , as they as@@ sures the market a major role in the allocation of resources , a legally state field of business is guaranteed and the market open , said the statement . &quot;
the government is also loos@@ ening controls over the powers that are transferred to the company to take part in the business of their businesses .
the statement also said that China &apos;s border area will allow new models of cross @-@ border business operations and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open @-@ controlled branches , further areas will open for private investment . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legal interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services to them , &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; for foreigners , it is easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card , &quot; which will enhance the requirements and facil@@ it@@ ates the application process . &quot;
&quot; the right to guarantee their lawyers to practice their activities , using professional judges and pro@@ secut@@ ors , was also discussed during a session . &quot;
&quot; in the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders , like Liu Yun@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , participated in a meeting published after the meeting . &quot;
EU doesn &apos;t want to double mercury @-@ level in pre@@ dat@@ or fish
&quot; the European Commission plans to double the limit for mercury in big pre@@ dat@@ ors , and thus contributing to consumers a significantly higher dose of ne@@ c@@ ater . &quot;
&quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which is a valid worker in the EU , critic@@ ised the plans for lack of industrial and environmental policy . Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt was crit@@ ically given at F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve cells are to be increased to large fish at the end of the food chain like shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish , &quot; of a mercury @-@ weight of mercury in two milli@@ grams of mercury in each kilogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; large pre@@ dat@@ ors are however already loaded with mercury , that on the basis of current limit values are not sold approximately 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling of the limit values , only a 5 percent are not for sale . &quot;
&quot; in return for this l@@ ure , the EU wants to watch the limit values in other fish from currently 0.5 millimeters to 0,1 milli@@ gram of mercury per kilogram . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ood@@ watch , however , described this as &quot; trick , &quot; as small Fried@@ fish , such as car@@ p usually so low , that they already hold the planned maximum values already today . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the lowering of collapse is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ des de@@ co@@ hes@@ ive , &quot; that helps the economy alone , &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
mercury is a high @-@ high heavy metal suitable for people that were car@@ essing about the food chain above all in car@@ ni@@ vo@@ wels .
the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; low levels can cause particularly un@@ born damage of the nervous system . &quot;
the Federal Environment Ministry stated on his homepage with regard to the applicable limit values but that an &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population would not be expected .
mercury gets mainly through the coal combustion in the environment .
&quot; according to a written information provided by the Federal Ministry of Environment , German coal power plants Pe@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ k numbered more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total in Germany em@@ itted total . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mercury in fish in El@@ be , Rhine and Danube would be &quot; permanently and widespread &quot; , &quot; the &quot; Mir@@ ror &quot; was quoted in March of paper . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , mercury in all European war@@ nings are already common in the EU @-@ warning system R@@ AS@@ FF . &quot;
