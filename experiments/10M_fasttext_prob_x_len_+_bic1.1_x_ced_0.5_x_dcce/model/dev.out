Obama receives Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has not exactly been friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as Teheran &apos;s destabili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; in this meeting , however , it is also about conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for several years .
Washington has critic@@ ised the continued settlement of Israel and Netanyahu killed a lack of confidence in the peace process .
&quot; by the Obama &apos;s promoted deal around the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship of the two is further deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in March , at the invitation of the Republi@@ can Congress , Netanyahu had held a controversial speech to the U.S. Congress , which was partially regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken to Obama , a meeting had rejected this with regard to the previous election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor , his girlfriend have shot up &quot;
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ annon was one of the wrong voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and had to come to his house .
&quot; he &apos;s important to emphas@@ ise that his &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is still alive and probably excited , and he said , the family contacts of dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house , officials found the Lei@@ che of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that I loved , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by me . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that he was in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ veland , Mississippi , settled just 300 miles to the school property , where , according to the police , he received a popular history professor , eth@@ ane Schmidt , at the door to his office and killed . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ qu@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university employees have heard shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that he did the f@@ ateful incidents eventually then on then .
by the end of the day there was another death : lamb was taking the life when the police picked him up .
&quot; after a sli@@ der in the university , the students and teachers were forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what &apos;s motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators in either of the state , as well as what students and collaborators who knew him , helped bring an idea of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers . &quot;
students said that they were happy about his teaching .
&quot; the police on the Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , he did not have any history of violence or a criminal record . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself was mentioned in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both represented in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty is 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some in@@ clin@@ ations to be problematic .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised himself , he also seemed to be a little excited and nervous as if something were wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb told him he had at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress . &quot;
he had previously asked the Delta State University for a funeral of health reasons and told that he has any health problem .
this year he has only arranged two online courses .
recent changes in the employment policies of the university did mean that the promotion for which he had worked so hard for him - would represent no guarantee of an automatic path to an assessment as Assistant @-@ Professor .
&quot; university President William La@@ o said he &apos; caught nothing about a conflict between His Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs show . &quot;
they are questions that I cannot answer any more .
&quot; after the flight from the campus , the police found later Lam@@ bs track , as he again to the Mississippi of Arkan@@ s@@ as import . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , he was self @-@ owned by a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about one mile south of his parent on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ c@@ meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still running out .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lamb was at this house , but Johnson said that she didn &apos;t know the people who lived there . &quot;
God grew up in the area .
&quot; founded in 2009 his work at the University , the 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 residents and taught the geography and education . &quot;
he graduated in the spring in pedago@@ gy .
&quot; one of the many years of friends of Lam@@ bs turned him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Carla H@@ air@@ ston said , she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through joint friends . &quot;
&quot; you and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar game . &quot;
it was then the women &apos;s warm .
&quot; every girl mel@@ ted that when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in Jackson Sub@@ city of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; he said in the emergency &quot; &quot; I killed my wife &quot; , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house that is adjacent to a ba@@ b in the Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced before 15 years ago , but friends stayed and a daughter who was 19 years old now . &quot;
&quot; it was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ aks on his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; o &apos;@@ Ste@@ i said , he &apos;s never met , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in his music and played blues . &quot;
he met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail picked up two years ago both in a summer year@@ book .
later they played together one or two other gig .
&quot; o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings her own music . &quot;
cre@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for different companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ arten@@ ders , and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak illuminated Bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he &apos;s he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night ki@@ cked off the night after his guitar and harmon@@ ic@@ z@@ el termin@@ ated before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the places and rejo@@ iced with each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of jo@@ kes .
&quot; Schmidt , the t@@ ote professor , led the first semester program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , &quot; Don Al@@ an Mitch@@ ell , said an English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the State University of K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his Brotherhood and his students committee .
&quot; the Delta State campus in Cle@@ veland on Tuesday evening will take about 900 people , including teachers , employees , students and members of the community to a candl@@ eli@@ ght ceremony in the ceremony . &quot;
&quot; Schmid@@ ts Ms Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the vi@@ gi@@ l , during the University &apos;s &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; amazing grace . &quot; &quot;
the classes will be added on Wednesday again .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; says La@@ o . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ gel@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ veland , Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press author Em@@ ily Wagner ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans having contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that he did not have an emergency , after he shot himself , and that Lamb clearly stated his wife as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
To@@ ys R Us is planning to adjust less man@@ power for Christmas
&quot; To@@ ys R Us says that it is not so many Christmas @-@ season employees as in the last year , but the toy and baby @-@ product dealer says that he will give the date with him employed workers and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;

Michael J. Fox tells his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat at the theater for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty and it will gradually realise that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to me in mind that I am a simul@@ ated har@@ ass@@ ment and an el@@ eng@@ ths away from it , with the princess of Wales at one date . &quot;
&quot; back in time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ ah Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , and director Steven Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had been in premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s for me really , &quot; &quot; Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; said the biggest Time of Time film , which ever was filmed . &quot;
&quot; back in time &quot; will be available on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinemas in October . &quot;
UN Secretary says : there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; ban K@@ i @-@ Moon , Secretary @-@ General , says that its response to Russia &apos;s military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of nearly five years of conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN administrator calls for all parties , including the shared UN Security Council to unite and to assist inclusive negotiations in finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; Mr B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday , he is planning to discuss the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Britain and France - on the ver@@ ge of the General Assembly of the General Assembly again this month in order to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
it de@@ pl@@ de@@ pl@@ ated that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable .
&quot; B@@ an called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity to tackle the crisis in Syria , which proved to be proved with Iran in the achievement of Iran &apos;s nuclear agreement . &quot;
&quot; 8 survey values , which show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious to take . &quot;
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
some have done it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Re@@ public@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper runs in surveys , it has not worked ( yet ) . &quot;
ten of the last eleven national surveys exhibited Donald Tr@@ ump in a double @-@ digit range and some start to wonder what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate .
of course it is still too early in the election period .
nobody declared that Tr@@ ump will likely gain the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphas@@ ise that in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ y &apos;s lead has been issued by the rising Herman MP , of which none of whom won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have fought in a general election .
yet outer side @-@ groups like E@@ b Bush &apos;s super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth acknowledge the m@@ umps and begin to let down their dollars flow to pl@@ unge it .
here are some current survey values indicating that the real estate in real estate is not just a temporary phase :
&quot; tr@@ umps are given around 180 degree of umps . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid June , showed a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University , that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans looked positive to real estate agents . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
&quot; now , six of ten Re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
roughly three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures remain in early states .
&quot; a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac @-@ vote in Iowa has determined last week , that 60 percent of the Re@@ public@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump . &quot;
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with p@@ umping as a candidate .
&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / Or@@ c last week said 67 percent of the Republi@@ can , they would be either &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; happy &quot; &quot; when Tr@@ ump would be nominated . &quot;
only two of ten say they would be &quot; angry &quot; if he would be the candidate .
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 % say they would be &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about trou@@ gh ) . &quot;
the next in excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they are &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the appeal of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , would be a candidate . &quot;
a majority of the re@@ public@@ ans see Tr@@ umps temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ bas@@ tic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 per cent of the Irish re@@ public@@ ans issued the right temp@@ er for a president , ABC . news / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is true in the first court of the nation , the state of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of the Re@@ public@@ ans think that it is the personality of Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to operate effectively , and almost six of ten independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament does not p@@ asse in the White House , as ABC / post . &quot;
republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; when they get their nest @-@ herd , republi@@ can voters find Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a survey of CN@@ N / Or@@ c from the last week four out of ten is that Tr@@ ump will be the best bet . &quot;
it &apos;s a change since the time when four of ten late July put their money at Je@@ b Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P @-@ voters in the past did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this stage in the last cycle , four of ten Re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination from just 28 % for the final candidate in Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , a great number of GO@@ P constitu@@ ents were seen as a plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even when the Republi@@ can gathered around one other candidate , Tr@@ ump will still attack everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts suggest that this sh@@ atter@@ ing field probably helps to run tr@@ umps leadership , while anti @-@ Tr@@ ump Support is widely distributed on more than a dozen other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that there is a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump the health support . &quot;
&quot; he left C@@ arly Fior@@ ina 13 points , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , front of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before E@@ b Bush 19 points and finally from Rand Paul , John Ka@@ himself and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
there is a head @-@ at @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the business builder with 19 points at a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ race .
a scarce majority of Donald @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ fans tells them that they have formed their minds .
&quot; a new survey of CB@@ S / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support the Tr@@ ump , says they have won their voices . &quot;
&quot; of course , much can happen to change it and no one can truly say , never change the opinion . &quot;
46 percent said they leave the door open in order to switch to other candidates .
&quot; however , the most umps is strongest competition in the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon , Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as often for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say that they are in agreement with Tr@@ ump , immigration . &quot;
&quot; since then , Donald Tr@@ ump in his electoral campa@@ igning two months ago immigrants from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ist , &quot; was immigration and fishing point in public discourse on 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ bas@@ tic ex@@ cl@@ utter@@ ance of Tr@@ ump pi@@ Hisp@@ ano Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can Party and damaged the neo @-@ oriented efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / post survey of Monday , six of ten Re@@ public@@ ans , that they agree with Tr@@ ump in case of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as immigration is delayed in the spotlight , it will be run by Donald Tr@@ ump apparently . &quot;
the frustration of the government cl@@ am@@ ers to new high@@ s .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son now cat@@ ches around half the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially by their out@@ sider status . &quot;
&quot; six of ten re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey of D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Re@@ public@@ ans in the Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent angry . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five exclusive neighborhoods of Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg is the most expensive residence building - overlooking the Nord@@ se@@ e@@ watt .
&quot; in the street , it costs a square meter of a roof @-@ roof in the average 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is naturally limited , therefore it is stated in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
&quot; a new study shows , in which special layers , one square meter is the most cost . &quot;
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for one student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; contrary to Germany &apos;s top @-@ good , the price does not appear before the pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the Real @-@ service provider angel &amp; Völk@@ erst@@ ers has published a list of exclusive German housing sites - with square meter high in di@@ zz@@ ling heights .
&quot; there are several tens of Euros nothing - per square meter , well @-@ known . &quot;

&quot; by the way , Munich is exceptionally not the top . &quot;
Champions League : Bayern @-@ Dream start thanks to Müller and Got@@ tz@@ e
doubt Tor@@ cher in Pir@@ aus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just run a course .
a lucky member of Thomas Müller eb@@ led the FC Bayern to the way to a well @-@ deserved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Piraeus - then ran .
a sovereign race of the Champions League season .
the World Champions Thomas Müller and Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e have protected the FC Bayern in Wit@@ en@@ kes@@ sel from Pir@@ aus a dream start to the &quot; mission Milan . &quot;
the team of trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their season in the Champions League at the Greek record masters Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Mü@@ llers ( 5@@ 2 / 90@@ 2@@ + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es hit ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth victory in series is meant to be the first step towards the finals on May 28th 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola will finally take the third attempt at the Hen@@ kel@@ pot@@ t after Munich . &quot;
&quot; Müller received at his 28 results in the Champions League for Bavaria &apos;s leading @-@ attendance of the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ go@@ alie Roberto , who had to happen as a f@@ lange &apos;s cens@@ er of the world &apos;s grand@@ master . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate the &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m in front of the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ akis @-@ Stadium in front of the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ akis @-@ stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich key@@ note speech . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed idea without giving up .
&quot; Piraeus had won his recent six home@@ games in the Royal class , among them well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
in 2011 Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but Bavaria , in seven Europe @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams un@@ defeated , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went through bold , with their open efforts , but often to un@@ ambig@@ u@@ ously . &quot;
the attacks were often introduced to a sei@@ ge on homosexu@@ als Douglas Costa in advance of the former Braunschweig and Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right than its flan@@ k hit the right half box in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion existed the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half of one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
&quot; first , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storms ide@@ ye Brown hit the head ball of Poland by the line ( 26 ) . &quot;
&quot; then with direct deduc@@ tions , the go@@ al@@ gam@@ on Roberto with the knee par@@ ted ( 3@@ 5th ) . &quot;
even though the Bav@@ arian had raised a dominant game , pir@@ acy could be pushed into a needle . &quot;
on Tor@@ boun@@ ce Manuel Neu@@ er he was reli@@ ance .
about him when he turned out a shot of ide@@ alism over the l@@ ad ( 5@@ 6th ) .
&quot; before leaving Gu@@ ardi@@ ola , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola ordered a quadru@@ ette with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng he made it fine . &quot;
&quot; Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e , after muscular problems back at the cad@@ res , sat first outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero was given as green light after the closing session , he said sport . Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it , that is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; also during the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sle@@ y Com@@ an for the late Le@@ wal@@ ov@@ sky ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ tz@@ e came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made 13 minutes later everything clearly , with El@@ f@@ le Müller yet added to it . &quot;
in front of the game saw the stadium at the stadium .
&quot; after a smaller group of partly bun@@ ni@@ fied Bayern fans in their Viewer @-@ Block obviously prov@@ okes the fans of hosting Pir@@ re@@ aus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with p@@ aves against the Munich followers . &quot;
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; who smo@@ kes , therefore does not only look for the lungs but also the teeth - that determines a Pots@@ dam@@ er long @-@ term study . &quot;
the good news : at forgetting the risk quickly .
smokers have a much higher risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this is emerging from the long @-@ term study by an international research team , including several staff of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smokers , smoking was the risk of losing their teeth in front of the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.@@ 6 times higher . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
primary causes for cr@@ acy are ca@@ vities and inflammation of the g@@ um line stresses that DI@@ E .
for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis smoking is a risk factor that emphas@@ ise the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore going back to frequent g@@ um disease in smokers .
&quot; to be clarified , to what extent smoking also increases the risk of dental c@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; people having been hearing with smoking could reduce their risks in a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it could take over ten years before the haz@@ ard returned to the level of non @-@ smokers , explained by Thomas Diet@@ rich by the English University Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one has to convince humans who are to be non @-@ smokers , stated a study manager H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and leads to our findings also to a good dental health up to the high age .
&quot; for more than 20 percent of the population at the age of 65 to 74 years of dentistry , the DI@@ E E shared . &quot;
previous studies have already been advised that smoking is the risk to early eradic@@ ating .
the new long @-@ term study sub@@ mo@@ wing the findings .
archae@@ ologists met at Köl@@ ner R@@ u@@ fer to rem@@ n@@ ants of the late 19th century .

&quot; since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called soil monuments . &quot;
&quot; for all construction projects in the city district , Cologne will always be consul@@ ted with the Museum of Archae@@ ological Phen@@ om@@ orph@@ an@@ age . &quot;
in the third section of the Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ards the archae@@ ologists were now successful .
&quot; text documents had already been known , that there was a fortress built in the 4th century and stood up a church in the 8th century . &quot;
&quot; next to remains of the fortress and the cherry , a cemetery with approximately 350 graves were also discovered which was probably part of the church . &quot;

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; for the shar@@ pen@@ ing of the dispute regarding the planned transatlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed a substantial reform of the current arbitration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private arbitration institutions for disputes between companies and states are intended to be replaced by a transparent system , which is significantly more traditional in its operation . &quot;
&quot; we want to set up a system that will trust the citizens , &quot; stated the responsible EU @-@ commission@@ er Cecilia Malm@@ ström in the presentation . &quot;
&quot; in front of us , the P@@ ig has recently submitted the proposal as a European negoti@@ ator for the Free Trade Agreement with the United States . &quot;
the German government announced support .
&quot; through TTIP , the world &apos;s largest free trade zone is to be created with 800 million people . &quot;
plans for the reform of the current arbitration proceedings cont@@ ended in particular that the EU states and the U.S. select independent judges for a new investment house .

Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ ns Deb@@ ut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Secretary of the Prime Minister
&quot; since its election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ &apos;s deb@@ acle is expected at the Prime Minister from the Prime Minister with excitement . &quot;
he was said to give the Prime Minister Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ n by the Prime Minister &apos;s debut in the Prime Minister and was on his debut for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n rose to make the first of his six fores@@ een questions shortly after noon but his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the UK authorities .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; on this weekly event .
he has also said that he could skip some sessions to let them leave their colleagues .
&quot; the encounter will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , for it comes after being appointed a member of the shadow , and following his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour Chairman , held on Tuesday during the Sin@@ us National An@@ them at a commemor@@ ative ceremony at the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has been at the center of various title @-@ stories in newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision , not to sing the national an@@ them , has drawn attention to itself &quot;
a narr@@ ator by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he was &quot; in a respectful silence &quot; and he did the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Air Battle of England . &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ &apos;s Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he has got to sing the Labour leaders , the national an@@ them , &quot; independently &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished . &quot;
&quot; just a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve Mr Cor@@ by@@ &apos;s leading team , and they conven@@ ed on differences in business , defense and foreign policy , while less than one @-@ sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party was supported by the leaders . &quot;
&quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ ack@@ able inside of Labour and , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ &apos;s comments on the position of the European Union , and the limitation of gains . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour came forward to remove the whole idea of limiting .
&quot; Mr Smith said Mr Smith , the Sha@@ de @-@ Labour and R@@ ent Assembly , that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that they are only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23@@ ,000 pounds . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour Chairman of David Cameron , since he ist T@@ ory @-@ chief , across the last decade on the Disp@@ atch box in the Parliament over the last decade . &quot;
&quot; the Labour president , who promised another policy approach , says he &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington state MP did said that the fra@@ grant of the Prime Minister is to confront , and that it will refrain from &apos; pot@@ ency &apos; and the dispute with stri@@ kers , and instead , to concentrate on serious problems like poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle is represented as the shadow of economic minister if he is not participating - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally seize the word , and that he said John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the house , addressed to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; he was leaders in 2005 that he said Mr Cameron , he wants to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ Theatre &quot; , &quot; which is often connected to the Prime Minister &apos;s style . but some years later he moved , that he has failed . &quot;
&quot; since they were first sent on TV in 1990 , the question by the Prime Minister has been deemed by the Prime Minister as the principal bar@@ ometer of the premi@@ er of a leader and his position in the House of Commons and his position among his parliament@@ arians , though he had ar@@ gues , she became a caricature and raised broad @-@ minded reforms . &quot;

this percentage have been the quick@@ est and fastest interpre@@ tations over the time of interest in 2009 .
&quot; the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was covered up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the Euro to 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 index ended with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after takeover bid of the ri@@ vals was included .
&quot; one transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands like bud@@ dies , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;

Met@@ rac starts from insur@@ g@@ ural campaign to combat al@@ imp@@ unity
met@@ take tries to safeguard the Ig@@ A branch in front of an Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholesale distributors have launched a supervision campaign to defend the market share of Ig@@ A @-@ retailer in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million Swiss Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; during Al@@ di the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia started off the next year , strengthen the cash and Ig@@ A supermarkets your relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand Ig@@ A through mainstream marketing and marketing about social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A retailers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice manufacturers S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , which distributed in Ig@@ A stores samples and shop @-@ owner , who sell fine tickets to the South Australian soccer league to loyal clients . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to take the cash to further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholesale distributor for food , alcohol and devices conduc@@ ts its annual investment strategy . &quot;
&quot; it is much at stake , since South Australia and Western Australia constitute nearly 30 percent of the Points of Ig@@ A &apos;s business business , and generate higher profits as Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A network in the Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; in South Australia and Western Australia , not@@ or@@ ically provincial and Ig@@ A @-@ retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia , compared to about 14 percent in the east states . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts as Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Al@@ di twelve months after opening its first markets will take approximately five percent of the food market in these two states and will take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley that Ig@@ A @-@ retailer 360 USD $ million will be losing sales per year and Met@@ rac 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
this pre@@ diction is based on the fact that Al@@ di opens up 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and will generate sales of 500 million $ and 600 million in each market .
&quot; the loss in food and gro@@ c@@ eries and the quantities at Met@@ cas@@ hs high fixed cost could cost the cash of $ 13 million before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , met@@ all cash market shares in the east states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently run survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that Ig@@ A @-@ Single is the most faithful . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley takes up that met@@ ros sales in food and grocery are 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 to reduce 4.@@ 1 percent in 2017 and 2.@@ 1 per cent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , held at a business in Melbourne , that Met@@ rac will probably disappear within a decade . &quot;
cash refused to publicly respond to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
&quot; however , it is understood that a Board of Met@@ als with Mr Dou@@ glass last week has been in contact . &quot;
&quot; IG@@ an market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ cas@@ hs food and food trading , which is approximately 1,@@ 200 Ig@@ A retailer holds a rate of about 43 percent , which is also reflected by its operational debt reduction in turnover on sales and margins . &quot;
&quot; wholes@@ al@@ ers denied , however , inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to deliver sales prices by hundreds of products each week and by Ig@@ A retailers in improving their stores through fast growing fresh foods and providing a better choice of private label foods . &quot;
&quot; met@@ a main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustment and shop refurb@@ ishment programmes are to be submitted and hopes that the wholesale distributor in 2017 will return to income growth for the first time in four years . &quot;
Than@@ ared Kok@@ kin@@ akis is supported by president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ ared Kok@@ kin@@ akis deserve more praise as criticism for his behaviour .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damages &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and in the opinion of the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly prefer praise as criticism to his own behaviour .
&quot; co@@ kin@@ akis , the younger of talented Du@@ os , which is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; triggered by the famous confrontation of K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA in the Montreal Masters in the lim@@ eli@@ ght . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery qualification race in Cincinnati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ akis and his opponent Ryan Harrison should be separated from the refer@@ ee once Harrison : &quot; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have taken C@@ yr@@ gi@@ os , and I should hit the child . &quot;
&quot; as recently seen , as he was seen a tennis r@@ acqu@@ et , after a cr@@ amp@@ f was crus@@ hed a potential US Open @-@ win of Richard Gas@@ quet , it was defended by Kok@@ kin@@ akis of He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth , for second place in the single word behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ finals against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I should ti@@ ghten up pretty , the fact that after my view T@@ asi has been drawn somewhat in the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a r@@ ack@@ et as he lost on because of a var@@ ish in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat from frustration by himself , and I know T@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; however , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so forth , and I think he earned a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I believe it was a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 , he works very hard , and he is working in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is fine in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I believe he deserves to be judged by his own merits . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision of taking K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os to take into account the major decision making on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all but he secur@@ es the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to come back as a long @-@ term integral part of the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely concentrated on the competition and not all around the controversy &#91; C@@ yr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; I think Nick was very quick pointed out to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray pointed out . he goes hand in the eyes of the public , and he deserves some bad mistakes and he deserves all the criticism that he gets , but we try to give him the consequences of his action . some time outside the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , and it is best for the crew and it is best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declared emergency , closes the border , holding refugees back &quot;
Hungary explains the emergency and ri@@ eg@@ ated the border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the stuck who tried to survive illeg@@ ally in the country . all with the aim of stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
&quot; chaos followed on the border , when hundreds of migrants re@@ acted to a kidney and Serbian officials with outra@@ ge . &quot;
&quot; the people that had fled from violence , hidden for some unknown time at the street between the two check@@ points of the countries and built tents and settled down there . &quot;
but frustration went up .
&quot; as a police helicopter above them sli@@ d , the migrants &quot; opens the border &quot; and sho@@ ot@@ ations against the Hungarian poli@@ cem@@ an . &quot;
some she@@ aths from protest food and water back .
Serbia &apos;s foreign ministers stated that migrants would be returned from Hungary during more and more Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral problem .
&quot; during the coming days meetings with Brussels and other countries will have to take place &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence of the Hungarian @-@ Ser@@ b border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ bloc with no common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the Ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who , who shr@@ unk from Italy to Greece . they expressed their hope that after all - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would pick out more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit in the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not put his hopes for an early release of Brussels or its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the authorities in two southern regions gave the authorities more powers to meet the crisis , so that they eliminated roads and accelerate asylum . &quot;
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country had also plan to build a thor@@ n wire from its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country after having crossed a fence at the Serbian border .
CB@@ S News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison mates at the race to create bar@@ bed @-@ wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East as a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and a point of entry into the European Union . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most of the incoming economic migrants are seeking a better life and non @-@ war refugees who are entitled to protection - one view that strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which entered into force at midnight of Hungary , make crossing the border or the damaged by the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence , leaving the government alongside the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also lay higher yields for sentenced to man . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation that emerged through the mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the emergency condition , &quot; said Executive DI@@ AM@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the Southern city of Sz@@ eged . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; Parliament must still agree to the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have been struggling with heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security advisor for Or@@ ban said , authorities 45 people trying to cross the border to cross the border , 15 others have already been deeper into the country . &quot;
they come across by being ashamed of the fence and are now condemned into custody and are accused of criminal off@@ ences under the new law .

election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead in before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
&quot; the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit advantage in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins it in front of the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton is now supporting 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders are second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Joe Bi@@ den , vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet proclaimed whether he di@@ des for the presidential office , gets the support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates will support them . &quot;
&quot; however , Clin@@ ton &apos;s supporters are more permanent than those of the other candidates . &quot;
&quot; since the CB@@ S @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders had posted some profits . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has a strong competitive edge in women and moder@@ ates , but these proj@@ ections have reduced . &quot;
&quot; their support for the men has declined significantly , and S@@ ander is only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ t &apos;s advantage with democratic constitu@@ ents below 50 years of age has become vac@@ ant , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height . &quot;
Clinton has still a big advantage with the elderly voters .
&quot; last month , Clinton had been a double @-@ digit back@@ head at the liber@@ als but S@@ anders now has a 5 point lead in this group . &quot;
&quot; about half of the democratic voters of the elections were over , say that Clinton would also assist with enthusiasm when they were nominated by the Party . &quot;
&quot; a quarter would maintain it with some advantages , and another 15 percent would just support them because it is the candidate . &quot;
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ ton @-@ &apos;s supporters are especially enthusiastic about it .
&quot; the views are more strongly mixed with those who at the moment not support Clinton - only about one fourth would love them enthusias@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; while 48 percent of democratic voters say the elections , that Clinton must support Clinton with enthusiasm , say little Republi@@ can voters this on their peak channel data by Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clin@@ ton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want to have the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the notion that it &apos;s time is that a woman president is ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clin@@ t &apos;s supporters is also mentioned in connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with problems and the di@@ ci@@ bility are also quoted .
&quot; as the vice president presi@@ des a potential for the Office of the Office to the scale , 57 percent of the democratic voters will see him in the race - although a third thinks he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked by the elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den will be at the hel@@ m . &quot;
&quot; of Clin@@ t followers , more than half of them would be their second choice in front of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; be@@ ers decides not even for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clin@@ ton continues to rise up on S@@ ander , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in the race track to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate , with the best opportunities to win the election ; however , this figure has dropped by 78 per cent in the last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far the second to this measurement , but the percentage of who at the &quot; &quot; sel@@ bar@@ gain &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; but when the question of what is more important with a Candi@@ date , Democratic voters call questions about the voters . &quot;
&quot; similarly as in the last month , not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters is determined as unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic Candi@@ dates or potential candidates perform good results with some important features on the constitu@@ encies of their party &apos;s pre @-@ elections .
&quot; maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trustworthy and with strong executives . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ den cuts best on honesty , while Clin@@ ton &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe it . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters of the elections in general see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; with all these measurements , about one quarter of the democratic voters has no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton have been using a personal email address and a server during the term of the Foreign Minister , most Democratic voters are satisfied with their declaration of the matter and say they didn &apos;t affect their opinions altogether . &quot;
but it is another story in the American public overall .
&quot; now , half the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their declaration , while only one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was in March , just after the problem of light came , split . &quot;
&quot; most Americans say that the E @-@ Mail controversy had no impact on their overall opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion of it still deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; they are mainly Re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of ten who say their views have become worse at the former . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered to be honest and trustworthy it , this continues to be a problem for them under registered voters overall : 32 percent do see them as honest and trustworthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of those entitled to vote hold them not for an honest and trusted person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of the voting rights have been seen as well as cru@@ st@@ ump than not honest and un@@ tru@@ stable . &quot;
Clinton and Tr@@ ump were given good notes for leadership .
&quot; of the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best shown in honesty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honestly , but as with Car@@ son many do not believe it . &quot;
&quot; the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre@@ term is 6 percentage points . &quot;
Ben Car@@ son moves across a nationwide survey close to Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is situated in the latest survey of CB@@ S News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; on the two candidates now half of the support of voters in the new survey , and others lose dramatically . &quot;
separate Republi@@ can voters continue to support country @-@ wide dro@@ wning in large numbers . the support is 23 % in the last CB@@ S survey conducted in the previous month by Fox . 27 % in the survey from Tuesday .
but Car@@ son flo@@ wed in the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
&quot; the survey was also found that Car@@ son is well @-@ addressed at demographic groups and cr@@ ump under Republi@@ can voters with higher education . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Governor John Ka@@ Himself , is struck with Wis@@ cons@@ ins of Governor Scott Walker , who is at the deepest , and has 10 % assistance in the last month by now 2 % . &quot;
the former Florida Governor of Kal@@ b Bush the former Governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are located at 6 % in third place .
the fault rates at the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / Or@@ c survey , which was published last week shows that Car@@ son is increasing in the Sur@@ ve@@ ys - he landed at 19 % assistance with Re@@ public@@ ans , behind the dump with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest survey of ABC news / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump clearly before Car@@ son .
&quot; with a view of one in the last week &apos;s rising Car@@ son , Tr@@ ump took some ki@@ cks for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son apologi@@ ze to question cre@@ umps belief in question . &quot;

&quot; even if top levels are only measured in the distance , a trip to bath@@ ers is already a trip to the Mediterranean in order to find still warm waters . &quot;
a bath in North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; there is no more to the sea : maximum 18 degrees , the water in the North and Baltic Sea in this week , shares the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) . &quot;

five members of the br@@ otherhood complete the death of a Bar@@ uch College
&quot; nearly two years after a student died as a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , dec@@ ord@@ ances will be filed against five people . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ P@@ SI @-@ P@@ SI leaders attacked Ch@@ un , &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a introduc@@ tory session in September 2013 , and delayed his transportation to the hospital , which contributed to his death . &quot;
&quot; said that he had been deb@@ ited with connected eyes with a 30 Po@@ unds sack full of sand , and being repeated , while he tried to watch over a frozen field . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g ultimately said to head@@ ache , then he was unconscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ P@@ SI @-@ P@@ SI leaders did not receive the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change your clothes , to goo@@ gle his symptoms , and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , said Poli@@ qu@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point the members , U@@ ten@@ si@@ lia began to hide and put the welfare of the Brotherhood in general about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ qu@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not revi@@ ved , and he died next morning at his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an auto@@ cr@@ e@@ report , Den@@ g was repeated with bl@@ unter @-@ strength injuries at head , trunk and thi@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Shi@@ eld of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies in the ski resort since 1970 , Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , represents in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held to account and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for Mor@@ ning the third Gra@@ des for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , will also be indicted for the attack and the formation of a criminal union . &quot;
&quot; we not only want to be held responsible for the individuals involved , but if there is an organization officially - officially or officially - this has sanc@@ tioned , we will also hold it to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Bar@@ uch College will officially refuse the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has vo@@ ke its affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases the interest rates
&quot; a raise raise , and the house will fall into stock , Ren@@ ate for bonds will rise , and the economy will be gli@@ ding into a recession . &quot;
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long this will last and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy provides only little instructions on how to proceed . &quot;
a recession came from the first interest rates within just 11 months and it lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ siveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , albeit not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial facilities react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. central bank have so much stressed that investors should not focus on when it starts increasing interest rates , but rather on the time period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
in fact multiple variables play a role .
&quot; in the end , market participants could however declare that the entire excitement was possibly exaggerated because of a place @-@ raising . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inevitably to be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Mr Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Financial Economics at Capital Economics , in a notification of customer . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal places , but still to a low level in order to fear se@@ is@@ mic shock , which seem to fear many . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean , however , that there will be no re@@ percussions . &quot;
here is a few historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as seen in the market last month , the delivery of inser@@ tions can make things volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; once the increase is made , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that wealth amounts to 12 to 24 months after the initial increase , which perhaps reflected the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank &apos;s analy@@ st in a recent study devoted to what was occurring after inser@@ ting the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more precisely , the market is in the past 35 years mostly in up@@ lift - about 14 percent - on the way to the advertising capital , fairly flat in the 250 days after a recent analysis , with an average yield in the last six previous cycles of 14,@@ 4 percent plus a current analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , chief system strateg@@ ist in Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks would later occur at the increases cycle and returns the return to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but inser@@ ts grow them often .
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that previously did not exist and which could accelerate a recession . &quot;
&quot; very remarkable is that the gross domestic product will be located at the expense of its lowest score , with a raising raise of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , in 118 positions , there was only twice the nominal value of GDP from 4.5 percent since 1950 . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.@@ 6 percent , expect that this will last , and expect the third quarter following information from the Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ tions at a so fragile economic setting could be risky and cast the question &quot; &quot; whether this time is different &quot; , &quot; the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; market participants have agreed throughout the year to a raising raise of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; for many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe , that the FO@@ MC could have an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trading gives an increase of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all Hei@@ ghtened cycles have taken place in 1950 to the present day in a super cycle with a growing momentum when GDP took place and on @-@ Lie@@ es@@ sion@@ sh@@ ö@@ w very fast after the beginning of recovery in the shadows &quot; , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery of what the worst recession in the observed phase was . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months now . &quot;
&quot; the solid income was also volati@@ le , since the market adop@@ ts a turnover increase , and the pattern is pretty similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than with shares if its strategic course change .
&quot; upon bonds , Ren@@ gu@@ ts appear to change the direction once the first increase / lowering of the cycle occurs . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the Hei@@ ghtened cycle , the An@@ lei@@ ghs began immediately , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; the shr@@ ubs of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to a closer and shorter period of time , and lead to an escal@@ ation of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ interest loans often bring better income in such a climate even though &quot; we are still careful , higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed In@@ come Analy@@ stin at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interesting , Jones , believes that the markets have already been adapted to F@@ ed @-@ Strategy . &quot;
&quot; apart from the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates are increased , while earning money has increased , long @-@ time stra@@ ined has increased and the volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market , when the F@@ ed sharp@@ ens its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and entire enterprises , companies that benefit the greater part of their business operations in the US , from which interest rates are rising and local products become more attractive . &quot;
multinational corporations with high debts become worse because an increase of dollar off their products on the global market is more expensive and also the funding of their debts .
&quot; the story clearly shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; stocks tend to react very positively three months after an initial appearance , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percentage points after each of the inser@@ tions , 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percent . &quot;
companies with high capital ren@@ ders and lower volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counterparts with low quality on average 4 ( percent@@ ages ) and 3 ( percent@@ ages ) .
debts will become a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates are mostly losing , &quot; said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; apart from pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising income . &quot;
&quot; savings could see gains through higher income , although experts of different opinions are , how quickly this will take place . &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM claims by Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; the conservative member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the transm@@ itter because of its &quot; &quot; ren@@ ces &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly able to distinguish increasingly from commercial ri@@ vals .
&quot; he also took onto the BBC Music Awards , and said that she has only im@@ it@@ ated The Br@@ its &quot;
&quot; parliament Col@@ lins Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked the show The Voice to and said , that this is not very original . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , claiming a leading parliamentary member and raises new pressure on the station to proving that he does something that does not do the private stations . &quot;
&quot; Conserv@@ ative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses that the public &quot; &quot; tw@@ isting &quot; &quot; tw@@ isting &quot; &quot; tw@@ inkl@@ ing &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial ri@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t use the word &quot; &quot; silly &quot; &quot; - but it seems to be transformed into Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he also ren@@ amed the BBC Music Awards , which started in the last December . &quot;
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which began last year , appear to be The Br@@ its only in a different name . &quot;
&quot; so when you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples , in which you only have to im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
&quot; the BBC @-@ General , pointed out the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to the public &apos;s live music and education . &quot;
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I am nowhere to learn anything else about classical music . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that really is uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and so the dedication of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works on orders , I also consider it really important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that harder to be working to get the audience out as did this in the past , because the British are less informed of classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production which during the hearing in the committee on the choice of culture , media , and sports held under fire to step into the feet of commercial ri@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory @-@ MPs Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice on - the musical talent show at the BBC , which was purchased by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of 22 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not especially distinctive ? &quot;
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - &quot; featured on special BBC @-@ fashion . &quot;
&quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house barn &quot; , &quot; if it is the next time a convers@@ ational age . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from other rows of The Voice in the future or to spend money from giving additional de@@ posit@@ ors for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet conver@@ sions came up in August on the slo@@ west and the Black Friday can be responsible .
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
last month there were the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000 .
online sales increased over three years ago by using mobile phones to buy @-@ in
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has stopped its issues
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual one has dri@@ lled , and many of the major shopping streets of Great Britain have transformed into gh@@ ost towns . &quot;
but experts say that there are now signs that the online revenues are st@@ agn@@ ant after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure on August made the lowest rise in growth since the start of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales are st@@ agn@@ ant after new figures have only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates of the previous years and go back to 2000 , this has progres@@ sed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG @-@ selling network of the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he declared that online sales increased three years ago , as buyers began to buy single purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it was meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now , this comm@@ its itself and we could possibly experience that growth is reduced . &quot;
&quot; the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for the decreasing order rates . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that buyers have their bought account prior to this event , taking place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers for their computer to get their bar@@ gain , and some retailer sites cras@@ hed . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , on whom the buyer could hold for bar@@ gain , buyers from doing a purchases . &quot;
a study of the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found a £ 1 study on the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium was issued a little over 1 £ online .
&quot; with some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases are now done via Web @-@ shops . &quot;
at the same time he buys more than a quarter of the people &apos;s clothing and shoes online rather than in the hut cities .
Muslims buried the Mak@@ k@@ ah of the Cran@@ e @-@ accident - Am Lad@@ in &apos;s family will sanc@@ tioned
&quot; the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims from the first funer@@ als in Mecca by the streets . &quot;
Saudi Arabia sets the collapse in part of the giant mu@@ dic Am @-@ store Group
&quot; the Ministry of Health said , that in total 3@@ 94 people have been violated , after the crane rus@@ hed . &quot;
hundreds of Muslims gathered themselves as 29 of the victims were gathered through the streets to bury the ones that were killed but a crane to Mek@@ kas great mo@@ an@@ ee rus@@ hed .
&quot; they filled , mostly in white dressed , the track , for their respect , for the first of the dead were their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ isse@@ z cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the funeral proc@@ ession went to the holy place , where only days before had a building cro@@ oked through the blan@@ ket of the mosque and then the loop . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi King would vote on the building company of the family bin Laden because of the disaster , which also left 3@@ 94 cas@@ h@@ ers , a san@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the bodies of 29 tre@@ mble that were killed as one crane through the Great Central of the central mosque of Mecca , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who went on his first pilgrimage than the crane clim@@ bs . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officials have already argued that the H@@ add@@ sch after Mecca were to come to Mecca , which will continue to go on . &quot;
&quot; today , King Sal@@ man , the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group would not have left the arm of the sick , when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arabic version of the Dec@@ ree , which was published by the State of Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language service of the news agency didn &apos;t notice this detail , but said the leadership of the company overseas would be prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man scre@@ ened to revealing what the overthrow of the Cran@@ e was plung@@ ed into a courtyard of the Grand mo@@ an@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims from the H@@ add@@ sch , who later held this month , gathered themselves together . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden Group has published no statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for an opinion . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree was also bl@@ amed for the group because of current security measures and because it did not co@@ operate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes with Mek@@ ka Groß@@ mo@@ c@@ ee as part of the massive building project that is led by the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group .
the family bin Laden has been linked to this ruling family from Saudi Arabia and takes over larger building projects .
&quot; the late leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a divi@@ der son who was dispos@@ s@@ essed of the family in the 1990s by the family . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane in the midst of heavy winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of any healthy man . &quot;
officials said that 15@@ 8 people stay in the hospital .
government representatives held that 1 Million Re@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to pay off to the relatives of the dead persons and the same sum of permanently injured .
other comparisons are kept in the half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is sur@@ passed
&quot; British employ more des@@ people , &quot; Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry says &quot;
the number of highly qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe took an increase behind them

at the same time King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q sales stand nationwide ;

&quot; it is claimed that British build their h@@ amm@@ ers and brus@@ hes in favour of the use of qualified European craftsmen who carry out work in their home , &quot;
if you are skill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush to the rise of walls do not belong nowadays to a minority .
&quot; British increasingly employ arti@@ sans in order to carry out @-@ to @-@ do jobs in their homes , so the head of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Véronique Lau@@ ry , new chair@@ men of King@@ fis@@ her who owns the construction markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from eastern Europe , offer services to low prices are now outdated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 more scre@@ ams shop , set up at tra@@ des@@ people and close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said , she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , as eight out of ten purchase decisions in the shop are met by women . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , the men ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the men . &quot;
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends , which have more female single households , which make more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; I still works for a majority of men in our branches .
we have to shift that stronger and balance .
&quot; in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of their decisions on the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a big role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British at the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has helped to pursue their top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her is nearly the only company , which has occupied exactly 50 per cent of the teams with women , including management and financial status . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; this was a deliber@@ ate decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her mel@@ ted a decline in half @-@ year income and turnover , after the group climbed up the costs of the closing of the stores . &quot;
&quot; the trends will have King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open up 200 new branches . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ I / DO@@ B for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity before judgment
&quot; at the regional court of Kla@@ gen@@ furt on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian bel@@ at@@ vice @-@ register A@@ I / DO@@ B are responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and he@@ aters . &quot;
the accused did not guilty .
one of them was charged with authority .
&quot; from this accus@@ ation , he was acqu@@ itted in May and was acqu@@ itted . &quot;
the current process has been ad@@ jour@@ ned .
&quot; according to the former pro@@ secutor of Robert Ri@@ ffel ( At@@ tor@@ ney ) , Robert Ri@@ ffel has emerged and was allowed to disp@@ ose of the accused in 2006 to 2011 by the session accounts for which they disp@@ ose in their function , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; he will charge the damage with around 400@@ ,000 Euro . &quot;
the sports@@ men are also charged with financial statements .
&quot; this fact was divided by the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , Ri@@ emer in Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it is said to be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; as a result of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity the defence , the Defence did not constitute an asset to the society at any point . &quot;
&quot; the sports Func@@ tion@@ aries would only have been compensated and for the sport club , for which they had invested between 1982 and 2011 and invested a lot of time and money in which they carried out a lot of time and money - the pas@@ si@@ va carried in 2001 about 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( about 44@@ ,000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; then we stood before the situation : do we continue to carry or block the Club ? &quot; &quot; one of the accused , in the Br@@ ot@@ ok@@ f , audi@@ tor of the financial transaction . &quot;
he decided to take on this task with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants .
with all the risks .
&quot; we have gr@@ asp@@ ed money to get our life insurance as a safety in the bank , &quot; he said at the service . &quot;
as an association has been agreed : you can manage the money free it can only be made no debts .
&quot; furthermore , at the corresponding financial - success the withdrawal of the allowance should have been determined retro@@ active by 1991 . &quot;
&quot; a part of the allowance should be paid for only years later , namely in 2003 , when a plus had been paid to the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , also l@@ ump and not detail changes , the former Ob@@ mann explained the operations . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and di@@ visional books took the two def@@ endants , &quot; said the second accused . &quot;
why the withdraw@@ als have not been revealed in detail then the judge stopped .
&quot; the association has not been interested in detail for the financial crisis , but it was only the fault of the debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , as in 2011 , an official investigation took an official investigation for office abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the organisation &apos;s bank account . &quot;
&quot; that were back@@ agues , explained the accused . &quot;
&quot; this securities account went to the name of the second def@@ endants , and was not known to the association &apos;s statement . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; , &quot; wanted to know the judge . &quot;
&quot; after this , the respon@@ dent knew no answer for a long time . &quot;
&quot; then he said , he did believe that this was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if this had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of that money , giving the pro@@ secutor to the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ accused would have been informed , the functionality could be justified . &quot;
this transfer was formulated as a &quot; massacre . &quot;
why damage done ? who wanted to know judgment and pro@@ secutor .
&quot; the first def@@ endants , he did not agree to this formulation , because the association had never emerged as a result . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the attorney says , &quot; with whom you are all off the hook . &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; , &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore the function@@ ary said , he has never taken a c@@ ents salary , he only comp@@ uted o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ eting . &quot;
&quot; while di@@ eting has been charged the association 1,000 euros per month , the actual effort has been much higher , he added . &quot;
exact documents for the early years could not show the accused .
&quot; they , after a operational inspection , in which everything was judged correctly , were no longer stored , explained . &quot;
o@@ dom@@ eter tax also had the second indic@@ tee .
&quot; all the u@@ pris@@ ings were carried in cash , so he had to drive from his place of living international market to the Bank to Blei@@ burg , he stated in his statement . &quot;
the main proceedings of the trial will be continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard st@@ reaches more 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to three years of running personnel , the computer giant will build further jobs in the spl@@ itting of the company . &quot;

&quot; within the framework of its restructuring , the U.S. technology group plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 positions in his company . &quot;
the company should save costs at the amount of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.@@ 4 billion euros ) divided the company on Tuesday .
&quot; the step will lead to a tax load of around 2,@@ 7 billion dollars , which will drop off the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs since three years is not yet finished . &quot;
&quot; HP occupied the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 still around 30@@ 2,000 employees . &quot;

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police took place on the Ser@@ b border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and designer against several hundreds of refugees .
Eur@@ one@@ ws correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Boz@@ si@@ k has experienced the force of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees crossing the border .
behind it had a police line and behind the poli@@ cem@@ an was prepared by a water designer .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started with stones , blocks and plastic bottles after the officials . &quot;
the officials initially sit down without interruption .
then the police dis@@ used Tr@@ end@@ eng@@ a .
much lac@@ ri@@ eng@@ a was buried in the direction of the refugees .

the Time of Dec@@ ision on interest rates for the US denom@@ inations
&quot; the world is watched , when the U.S. staff arrives at two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision whether interest rates are raised for the first time since almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; a survey of 80 econom@@ ists , which was interviewed by Re@@ uters , the F@@ ed last week &apos;s opinion , that the F@@ ed will do this now , now that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and interest rates in the current state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 per cent . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it has seven years since the F@@ ed interest on N@@ UL@@ L . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank might start the zero space and a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Martin U@@ bi@@ des , Chief Executive Officer at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good power level , tri@@ llion dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate just a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less corro@@ sive view of global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; she has warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a step are good . &quot;
the decision will be announced at 8@@ pm CET on Thursday 20 : 00 CET on Thursday
death sc@@ orer at Delta State University left behind apologi@@ zing for it .
&quot; after the shooting and the kill@@ ings of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later missed his colleague and killed himself Sh@@ annon wrote a note to say that he was &quot; pity &quot; with the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could not make it happen &quot; , &quot; announced officials on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police on the Gau@@ tier , Mississippi said that he &apos;s lec@@ turer for geography and social education at Delta State University , calling the emergency number to 10 : 00 am Monday morning . &quot;
and said he killed someone and killed someone .
God told the people of the emergency center that the police have to be able to send c@@ emen to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not my wife last night &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , but which will not distur@@ b , &quot; &quot; but will probably be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the call@@ ers for his name , but he didn &apos;t give it . &quot;
he was no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police came out the scene they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice of Christopher , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , I could make it und@@ o . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the mem@@ or@@ em , 300 miles to Delta State University , where he was E@@ eth@@ ane Schmidt , a professor of history , killed before he eventually took his own life on Monday night when poli@@ c@@ emen climbed him . &quot;
&quot; university President William La@@ o said he &apos; caught nothing about a conflict between His Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs show . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the accused believed that Pr@@ enti@@ er had also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; of a &quot; Trinity relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was edited by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who out@@ told me that they were married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were for@@ ged 15 years ago , but were friends . &quot;
&quot; o &apos;@@ Ste@@ i said , he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have one daughter who is 19 , and had them &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were his daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to the statement by L@@ ins@@ day K@@ now@@ les , which has been identified by the Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; K@@ now@@ les told that treas@@ ury , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met her for approximately three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said K@@ now@@ les &quot;
&quot; he said my relationship at a given time on Monday to say to them , &apos; he did not go to prison . &quot;
&quot; when poli@@ c@@ emen climbed it on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in that night , his car drove his car to the side , ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
he was receiving a doc@@ torate in Spring 2015 of the Delta State University as his ré@@ sum@@ lau can receive at the university &apos;s website .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
Lufthansa plans to plant a big concert restructuring .
&quot; at least half a billion euros a year , the Lufthansa group wants to save money on a better organization . &quot;
&quot; 150 of the world &apos;s around 1,000 members worldwide will cost competitiveness in the workplace . &quot;
&quot; however , there are also new negotiations with the pilot plant union . &quot;
the Lufthansa will build its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the low @-@ approval Euro@@ wings .
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to that of some 500 million euros a year out of cost , and sol@@ ub@@ as , shared the airline on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , at Lufthansa there is no more board in the future for passenger volume in the future . &quot;
the tri@@ lig@@ hier@@ in@@ ia Euro@@ wings are designed to be developed as independently as possible .
&quot; in the board team led by chief Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr , he will be responsible for the next Karl Ulrich V@@ aud for Euro@@ wings . &quot;
&quot; with the new adjustment , Spo@@ hr under@@ scores the significance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group will be undertaking in the future against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ Jet plus . &quot;
&quot; so far , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex . &quot;

new negotiations with the pilots
the negotiations with the pilot and cock@@ pit ( V@@ IC ) are meant to be resum@@ ed in the negotiations after the judicial strike on this Thursday .
this shared the union with them .
the theme of the talks should be the down@@ grades for pilots .
cock@@ pit wants to get to a pre @-@ set result as quickly as possible in a year with a projected record .
the conflict between the unions and Air@@ line has led to a variety of strikes over the past few months .
&quot; background is in addition to the transition @-@ supply of the pilots the &quot; &quot; Save concept &quot; &quot; concept . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can not play for months because of double frac@@ ture
&quot; Luke Sha@@ w suffered the Champions League of Manchester , at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven a double correction of his right B@@ one . &quot;
&quot; while this has brought a wine to wines and exclu@@ des it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al is hoping that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
this injury was caused by an rel@@ ent@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was penetr@@ ated into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated in nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said , &quot; It has double balls and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will leave tomorrow or perhaps a day later and went to Manchester .
&quot; it is terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 to Manchester United , is very difficult and then it &apos;s really happening . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double correction , then it takes six months and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope that he can play this season again .
&quot; Mor@@ eno seemed lucky , to escape a red map and a suspension of an El@@ f@@ meter . &quot;
&quot; Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the Ar@@ bit@@ ration , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al assumed the Italian arbit@@ er was mistaken .
&quot; they can judge for themselves , if I say that a mo@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due . &quot;
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
&quot; I listened to Sha@@ ws Account : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my path to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Manchester United is suffering the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat of the PS@@ V &quot;
the United Kingdom &apos;s def@@ ender has an additional incentive in France to recover from the European Championship in France .
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very di@@ re injury . &quot;
if a player with this kind of injury leaves the place are all very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt any opponent .
&quot; Mor@@ eno suffered a leg , when Mexico plays against Van Th@@ as The Holland team in the 2014 World Cup . &quot;
&quot; he does very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that it is a terrible injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
&quot; for me , it was not possible to see the moment . &quot;
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball , which was in another direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; talking with S@@ BS@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels like , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Guar@@ dam@@ o was also brought into hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ dering by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron and The Lor@@ ax know better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not be long before you know it almost . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite children &apos;s book called to call himself the prime minister of The Lor@@ ax , who published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the firm Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a force@@ ful message , it is a book that I like to read my children because it always appears to have an image or message that we &apos;ve missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and well , except that the subsequent paragraph , in which Cameron is alleged to describe the act of the book , instead of announ@@ cing a content of the movie version of 2012 , added the new characters and details to expand the fairly short text . &quot;
&quot; amid the w@@ alled city Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , to see the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , compl@@ ying with her desire to see a real tree , he reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , his proper name The@@ odor Se@@ uss Geis@@ el lau@@ ghed and who died in 1991 , is completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; whether this would not be suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly introduced as the summary of the Lor@@ ax &apos;s movie database , which is all artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he is granted , his prag@@ matic father seems to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems that Cameron is getting as little familiar with the act of the book . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment due to the cas@@ gre@@ edy , hur@@ ling , Th@@ um@@ ent@@ ent beings , &quot; &quot; blo@@ ated in the name of the trees &quot; , &quot; is desol@@ ate . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR job was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has read The Lor@@ ax not 20 times in a small child .
a down@@ ing Street @-@ spokes@@ person said that the text was probably come from Camer@@ ons Elec@@ toral office .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text of Camer@@ ons has been delivered , but there were no further immediate comments . &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from the England squ@@ ad . but it is still hard
&quot; to@@ wing to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but if you selected the ca@@ des that England has chosen for tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series is not on my card . &quot;
I would not exclude a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; A@@ bur@@ air C@@ ooks side is probably less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the batt@@ ing list , and the shared spirit is strong ; they will not wear any sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as spin@@ ach Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even when it represents an un@@ familiar size on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
in this message Adam ly@@ th returns from the England Test Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; leaving Adam Ly@@ th &apos;s decision , obviously for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , is hard to analyze . &quot;
&quot; with its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ cket@@ players are aligned to result . &quot;
&quot; there were no fra@@ mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , as - and I mentioned this - Player makes her own best selection . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , it would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own destiny . &quot;
&quot; when he will hopefully turn further legs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor of the company praised his attitude , even if he did not get so good performances , and he &apos;s not surprised me ; he is above all a team @-@ man . &quot;
&quot; the question of how much time a test stroke is given to place his mark is difficult . &quot;
&quot; Ly@@ th was given seven odds - like Sam Rob@@ son before him , while Nick Comp@@ ton nine was born . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to do home and down@@ wards .
the only re@@ pro@@ ach who can rise up was that England was initially engaged in the Caribbean in the Caribbean - but this lost chance is now in the past .
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer that I highly like . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor Cri@@ cket@@ player , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 at a Tr@@ ent Bridge space , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he has to receive at least the same opportunities as before him , but this depends of course on the teams in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea of letting Mo@@ een by Cook , which would have an extra @-@ spin@@ ach Bow@@ ler and obtained four Qui@@ cken , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
I don &apos;t see why a drummer could not beat there and this link @-@ handed has already shown that he is a hot @-@ shot of cri@@ cket players .
&quot; Mor@@ een might not have done his job for its County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is it a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former team mate J@@ ustin Su@@ ger has played his first 38 test in the first Drop before joining in 2001 as Open@@ er .
he has made three hundred posts on right away and didn &apos;t look back .
&quot; Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ der as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited contact with him he impressed me as a young man . &quot;
people may see their statistics - on average 31 with the r@@ ack@@ et and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t but there is no large number of a backup minds that raise their hands and the trainers have decided on youth .
he will have a lot to learn on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made a few smart additions to the trainers . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Carolina , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the review could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nicest du@@ des of the game , who will bring a wealth of experience , as it has played in all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful engagement into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket matches , as players or as coach , and as Mah@@ ela he showed insights from which we can profit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , new voices can bring fresh wind during the locker room , even if the news has been in accordance with the previously mentioned . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ l@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be used for One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break from Australia and I have no problem with it . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team plates do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with players their jobs are depending on the outcome .
such decisions are not taken to a slight heart .
the Bre@@ xit camp ( Bre@@ xit = emigr@@ ation to Britain from the EU ) could win in Zul@@ u if the economy takes into a fishing tackle until 2017
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s nine @-@ hand re @-@ development strategy to hold great Britain in the EU will go deeper into trouble with every single day , even without the choice of brilliant Jer@@ emy , &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n for the leaders of Labour or the TU@@ C , who were heavily damaged in Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .

&quot; in Brighton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they risk the social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Be@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
&quot; prime minister and Minister of finance have climb on meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they allies do for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who , in an op@@ a@@ que Britain in the interior of the European tent , doesn &apos;t want us alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and let us know that more and more short @-@ sighted ministers and officials came to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we will stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cautious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an allies , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her as she is at the exagger@@ ation long exhi@@ b@@ ings such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French President François Hollande look back on his re @-@ election or its establishment in 2017 .
it is also a bl@@ ending power .
&quot; Poland immediately has a nationalist right government , Spain has a left . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to imagine that they will tear down a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British to get their energy better on it , Scotland &apos;s ex@@ iting from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers might even plan to un@@ inten@@ tionally un@@ helpful comment , entirely at the SN@@ P @-@ style , during the referendum in campaign to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , up@@ loading my friend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a ple@@ ural &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Britain has not won anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how r@@ ack@@ able the Fle@@ et Street can be on its costs and which EU scep@@ tics is the oligar@@ chy of the press @-@ bar@@ ous in 1975 but not having been making it during the referendum held by Tony Ben@@ n referendum in 1975 , which supported our entry into 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; she can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ euro @-@ Opport@@ un@@ ists who has made a name for himself as an &quot; EU straight @-@ line ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels @-@ correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; with all his cra@@ z@@ iness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were . &quot;
&quot; the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ causing cord , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ing foreigners and the pseudo @-@ in@@ countries , that have most of our great newspapers . &quot;
&quot; I actually thought Tony Blair similar to them , but noted that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better distribute ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of being at his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more bla@@ zers for Blair itself when he turned the referendum on the referendum against which he was rejected by the Constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 that opened a back door . &quot;
the press has never failed to pull him out .
&quot; but the nice Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly ch@@ ap on my back on Monday - I told him that he doesn &apos;t need any time for me to waste - seems to be in danger of Neil Bur@@ no@@ ck boy@@ cott , Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 &apos;s years , an error at that time and today . &quot;
&quot; it can last but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa has left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ &apos;s official position for Europe is - I always express it friendly - in the development .
he says that we should remain in a reform@@ ist EU .
&quot; now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps , traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ ho@@ und tendency and the wil@@ ler fil@@ tered by Tor@@ s@@ Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism may well say all of this to yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &apos; A Ben@@ n , but no ben@@ n@@ ite , &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said , as the boy sc@@ outs in him strug@@ gled to not admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns appointment of the provo@@ ke John Mc@@ Don@@ nell as the shadow advisor was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s years when his old father tried to succeed on television , il@@ ly , to his Labour cabinet , without going to too far and to lose his cabinet . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys combat was still more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to remain in all circumstances - Ben@@ n &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , but what J@@ C told his co@@ ats and MEPs following all reports on their lap on Monday night . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n expresses - think that he even has stir@@ red me - News @-@ discipline was important in the age of TV around the clock , and above all in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a hat@@ ch of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is correct to give Cameron not a free ticket for Europe which allows him to hold lab@@ ours support in the referendum for a natur@@ al@@ ness , as Mc@@ Don@@ nell &apos;@@ told . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins will surely think so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities in EU membership , in accordance with its Ben@@ n@@ ite Bel@@ ager@@ ening @-@ Economy , of its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion under left dissi@@ dents , for which the in@@ m@@ atism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ m@@ atism . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities in Nato - Tom Wat@@ son , fel@@ ine is convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign for the outlet - foreign diplomats must be oblig@@ ated to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they too have mis@@ trust@@ ful voters - to make concessions to the British if this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the U.S. is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , what I was reminded at the start of Monday , what British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum called . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise the report by public Health England on e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; allegations of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes have less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) pre@@ press the Lanc@@ et by critic@@ ising the use of Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes used .
&quot; he released the &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; in the past month and describes him as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and transferred to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; a editorial in the medical journal The Lanc@@ et last month took the &quot; &quot; exceptionally win@@ dy basis &quot; , &quot; on which p@@ he founded its most important conclusion . &quot;
two further researchers are writing to BM@@ J and asked whether the asser@@ tions are embedded in stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health , Health and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proving of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expects that the asser@@ tion of p@@ he that &quot; &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are based around 95 % less harmful as &quot; &quot; smoking &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of note and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multi @-@ core decision analysis Analysis ( multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ C@@ DA ) to lead their opinions about the damages from different nicotine @-@ based products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose executive director previously served by British American Tob@@ acco Control ( B@@ AT ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also sub@@ mits the references of B@@ AT to the Public Health in a Sustainable Development Report , &quot; they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants in the meeting declared to obtain funds from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not funding they have received following reports before the tobacco company Philip Morris International , to whom they added . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the body are not delivered , but these include several known e @-@ cigarettes rewards , some of which also provide some industry funding in the paper . &quot;
some other participants in this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in the tobacco management .
at the meeting the tobacco was also attended by p@@ he .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; conf@@ is@@ ingly , &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products at most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
however no of these links or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ he report .
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that allegations of p@@ he that &quot; &quot; there were so far no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes was intended as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he said that the asser@@ tions of BM@@ J were already re@@ acted . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies on his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggest that health risks from e @-@ cigarettes can be low compared to that , but we continue to study the long term impact . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the clear duty to inform the public about what is proven , and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about relative dangers compared to the tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 80@@ ,000 people annually die on a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs EUR 2 billion per year . &quot;
&quot; because of the clear proposal of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we meet our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ on , says former head of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should stop programs like East@@ on and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give her right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that cannot be sent by other UK channels .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC that they are publicly saw @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller crowd , in hard controversial time @-@ window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and from stations like BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; following the BBC @-@ General , Tony Hall , the company said more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said that he was able to get in touch with the BBC for six years . &quot;
&quot; I have had problems with the idea that the BBC programs gives or sends , who would also clearly show the re @-@ subsidi@@ zed rival , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communication Committee during his investigation about the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcast watch , what I don &apos;t consider in the medium or long @-@ term for a good idea , one should at least give your production on programs that others do not do or go on behalf . &quot;
they &apos;re sending the Voice in a first @-@ class window as they want to achieve as broad support for their future as possible .
&quot; the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridiculous , it &apos;s of course nonsense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ on is another , admittedly , both self @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; to be honest , other channels would give their right arm . &quot;
I am trying to see how this is public @-@ lawful television .
I don &apos;t think it would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , a contractor for series , run by Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambitions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments to the most popular shows of the BBC show what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ a@@ gart @-@ lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows like East@@ on . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ ic programmes were going to walk at BB@@ C@@ 4 , but they do not comply with it , but they accomplish their tasks , and they may argue if they have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs . &quot;
&quot; they put it in a window of window , in which no one ever wanted to see them . &quot;
&quot; for the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; I call on to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system regarding conditions of who can deliver the best value . &quot;
&quot; of course , remember all , we think that one gets a big value for 150 £ a year , but for people who &apos;s worth a lot of money for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if this is true , because they do not consume much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ chief David El@@ stein , who also declared before the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to review their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to make &quot; inform , &quot; and to entertain . &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC production would be classified as education - he said that there are 1 % of their TV output and 0.0@@ 1 % on the radio - and they should take part in the public @-@ law broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada .
&quot; at the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the one of the Pro@@ ms , said that only a handful of television was shown on television and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers in order to make all available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Pro@@ o@@ Get &apos; can control brain cells through sound @-@ waves
&quot; the video shows how the Nem@@ o changes the direction in the moment , where they are broad@@ cast@@ ed with sound @-@ impulses . &quot;
scientists have bred the wor@@ ms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by hi@@ kers of trans@@ fts .
&quot; the tiny Nem@@ o modi@@ fies the direction right now , in which they impul@@ sive with sound impulses , that have high frequencies for the human hearing , to be heard . &quot;
&quot; the impulses work by the switching of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to wear the membrane channels , which react to ultrasound waves . &quot;
further on this subject : researchers read and write fantasy activity with lights
&quot; the researchers said that the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure , called Son@@ o@@ Get , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an inv@@ asi@@ vely process that gives electric impulses to the brain of people for treating Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; do not usually react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , reinforce the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; the reinforced @-@ waves act on structures , which are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ IX channels and can be found in the membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms cells . &quot;
&quot; bells effect the opening of these channel channels and activate the cells , to which they are associated with , such a report Nature Communications . &quot;
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled Nem@@ o@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the wor@@ ms that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ens TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels carry out . &quot;
&quot; when he turned ultrasound on the changed creatures , the sound@@ waves are ampli@@ fied through the bul@@ b and transported to the wor@@ ms , where they turn the changed Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ s. &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some similarities with opt @-@ Get , a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to ren@@ ame neur@@ ons with impulses of light and switch . &quot;
&quot; however , Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ Get HO@@ ME could have some benefits across this technique . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to light , that must be sent down at an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , Ni@@ ed@@ ine @-@ ultrasound @-@ waves can happen freely and so can be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to become temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

eight golden rules for life in a student residence
&quot; eleven years ago I moved to a student dormit@@ ory , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the tense smile of those who I angry - and to the numerous , long @-@ armed complaints about others . &quot;
most of the things I have learned can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the saving of students is from easily nerve wr@@ acking up to absolutely fri@@ ghtening .
&quot; it &apos;s temp@@ ting to sho@@ vel : people tell wh@@ ence you come from where and where you &apos;ve taken Sab@@ bat@@ on , where you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly , Mar@@ m@@ ite do not love nor hate , because in the Ernst , guys , it is only a yeast an ha@@ haha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it draws up the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with which you wouldn &apos;t speak , even if your lashes would be gro@@ omed and this cre@@ ases . &quot;
let people die .
&quot; people &apos;s rooms often turn into beverages properties , film night venues and municipal venue , but they are also the places where people ti@@ ghten themselves and bring their under@@ wear . &quot;
&quot; in this way , do not remember to begin your university with a relationship . &quot;
In@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted get a gro@@ ove treatment at the university .
&quot; their room should be a refuge , yet many students lives form a space @-@ to @-@ space @-@ bum@@ ble@@ bee culture which can be friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who is trying to rec@@ u@@ per@@ ate yourself .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship goes on , but you must go away so I keep the energy back that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
are trying to feel when a compression of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted - and send it an SMS to knock .
apro@@ pos cra@@ p : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ory had the idea that a short door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by b@@ aking .
&quot; since you start the university at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ie , the knock on the doors of men , in order to find yourself with a plate of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange as the welcome of the 1950 @-@ er years &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have to give you something . so , and now please smile , if I give you some personal questions . &quot;
homemade treats is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
their room@@ mates feel obliged to chat and end up perhaps your face with a delicious surprise .
naturally this depends on whether you are a decent bakery .
&quot; bad bad l@@ ump from flour , su@@ gars and fat , make people sle@@ ep@@ y when you touch . &quot;
ste@@ al food is a common crime in our student dormit@@ ory .
&quot; of course , the cl@@ aws of chicken is a theft , but is it the take of a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
check the with the milk owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say , to serve themselves , even if they cook in the inside . &quot;
&quot; if anyone ste@@ als your belon@@ gings , the annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balanced than my room@@ mate , who added a washing machine to their milk to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should make no noise which keeps people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not only about being a decent man , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ ver@@ b to the people who are sitting in the gl@@ ass@@ room . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my corridor asking her neighbors , whether they made something qui@@ eter , drum , bass driver more qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they re@@ acted to this with still loud music .
&quot; when she finally heard about 5 o &apos;clock , she gave her neighbors also again two hours sleeping , before she ple@@ ases their own music and set her door to her three @-@ hour test . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would enter into the same student dormit@@ ory ?
&quot; the other way around , it would not be rather embarrassing when you keep a room@@ mate for your future contem@@ por@@ aries , break off at them and then have to see them each day and perhaps to experience how to bring all our common friends to yourself ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot hostess is definitely not your future marriage partner , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice that someone can leave his keys in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between a cor@@ k and bullying is fine when it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good cry is fun , but it only takes moments when it becomes the bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
give by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but do never neglect anyone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
&quot; close your door and place their keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but push its possessions on the ceiling no more than twice . &quot;
&quot; terr@@ aced houses for refugees , single @-@ extrac@@ ting , sc@@ ing@@ ear@@ ners &quot;
&quot; the real estate service Markus Gil@@ dner builds in the Central Region &apos;s Eck@@ es @-@ Thr@@ one terr@@ aced houses for people , who don &apos;t have much money . &quot;
&quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; not only refugees need accommodation , but also the single mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ deserved . &quot;
&quot; I show how to get cheap and well still today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot;
thousands of refugees are being pushed to the apartment market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner feels to know how quickly cheaper living space can be created : he builds in a project terr@@ aced houses for refugees .
Mr Gil@@ dner and many refugees are pushing to the apartment market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : mass accommodation in containers or g@@ ymnasium has no sustainability .
because human beings stay for a great part here .
&quot; in view of the refugee flow , we also need plenty of living space in the coming decades . &quot;
a very special and three @-@ storey building is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a town@@ house needs the least square .
it makes integration .
this is different when people are under@@ lining the people of living blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three units , each with four asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees are saying , it is peace again , I go back . &quot;
&quot; then , the houses can easily be changed according to their needs . &quot;
how high are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house has moved to 18@@ 4 000 Euros , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
six months later the construction took .
this is reasonable .
did the buildings have their plans further complicated ?
Gil@@ dner : I have worked properly for my project correctly .
particularly complicated it always makes the im@@ min@@ ent Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ tin @-@ heavy building and the Stell@@ ite Reg@@ ulations .
gl@@ us@@ el@@ y .
&quot; it will still be sub@@ ordin@@ ated , who creates three apartments in a terr@@ aced house , needs at least three locations . &quot;
only in the cities there is no place for this .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the inhabitants react to their terr@@ aced house ?
&quot; Gil@@ es : there were those who have accused me , creating new luxury buildings for asylum seekers . &quot;
what is definitely not right .
but ag@@ grav@@ ate you not the extreme @-@ struggle for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ es : true it &apos;s true : in the past five years we have been building a construction boom in Germany , but luxury apartments , which can hardly afford more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need a living room . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the only mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ ear@@ ner alone . &quot;
I am showing how to get cheap and well @-@ build even today .
therefore it is all about .

&quot; the new operating system can be requested by typ@@ ing in the settings , click &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it is ready , the telephone will give you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some are encountered after the installation on problems , because they get an error message that communic@@ ates the &quot; &quot; software update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to b@@ ypass the problem , users are advised to either get back to the rush or trying to update over iTunes . &quot;
the telephone itself will guide you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may also mean the del@@ eting of apps to create space - but Apple has made this easy to do so by using a special tool if you use a special tool , to delete apps and then re@@ install it once the process has been completed . &quot;
&quot; it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged up during the actu@@ alization or is in the vicinity of a charger , so that the battery is loaded . &quot;
&quot; when the load is too low , Apple does not let the update continued , as the phone may ab@@ stain at half way and this could lead to a demo@@ lition of updates . &quot;

&quot; in addition to the shopping market , immediately next to the shopping market , we immediately get senior and advice on information such as care insurance or health care and nursing homes . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have been firm with our out@@ performed care service , that often nursing homes are left alone . &quot;
there are endless lots of questions .
&quot; not rarely many benefits of the breeds will not be avail@@ ed in themselves because the complexity of the insurance company is not yet understood , &quot; explains the new landlord in Jut@@ ta W@@ eig@@ and , who is responsible for the Anton@@ cil and the Ombud@@ sper@@ son and for the out @-@ out service &quot; &quot; Ama@@ deus &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the meetings , the new Qu@@ arti@@ s@@ office offers also the prevention , health care and wellness . &quot;
this was taken by the Sal@@ u@@ dis with a boat .
&quot; therefore , you can use additional offers such as assault , memory training , or a physi@@ otherapeu@@ tic treatment . &quot;
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis is for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot;

&quot; witness the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den to Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; a new Afgh@@ an group , a 17 @-@ year old Afgh@@ an , was followed by the police of his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at this time the group was located at the height of the B@@ FT petrol station .
on the premises of the gas station there were also three persons .
&quot; one of these men now gar@@ ment the young people , and stroke this with their own . &quot;
the victim suffered a nose @-@ legged and bleeding valve from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends compl@@ ained and executed on the r@@ ack@@ et , he initially gave away his sacrifice . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the exp@@ elled young man was now being brought home . &quot;
the cul@@ pr@@ it followed the group with a passenger up to the dwelling and was running there several times past .
&quot; when you no longer saw the vehicle , the last one went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
&quot; here , he was once again attacked by the r@@ ack@@ et and another male . &quot;
under pro@@ claim of a head@@ deck train you tested on the face and the cr@@ ank of the victim .
the last one had to be taken to hospital for medical care within a hospital .

Dr. Frank Müller acqu@@ ires in practice Fel@@ ting and investing in 3@@ 10000 Euro .
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) perform the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ar .
&quot; in addition , Sam@@ ar@@ es@@ deb@@ tor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic sponsor@@ ships in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried cab@@ bert . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the countryside , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf on the other hand lack happiness : Dr. Frank Müller on the 1st of October , the practice becomes ste@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; during UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ting in retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is standing its successor in the coming months to a half place . &quot;
&quot; after a construction phase , Müller opened the practice until October 12 , until then , he is investing 3@@ 10000 Euros in the premises on the St. Mar@@ cell@@ qu@@ straße 6 . &quot;
&quot; he was sympathy with the first sight when the Fel@@ low@@ lands meet with years ago Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who at present time learning her technical education in the den@@ da hospital and wants to get into practice after the next year . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the Mü@@ llers would fit well into this practical experience , &quot; says Dr. UR@@ SE@@ L D@@ isti@@ ausen and lau@@ ghing . &quot;
&quot; when it was so far , I simply called it . &quot;
&quot; on the couple of Müller , the idea was to pursue their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; the proximity and the constant contact with the patients is very attractive to us , &quot; says The 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we would like to meet and accompany the families on the years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he was soon to be his own boss . &quot;
so one was agreed that the Mü@@ llers bought the house with the practice .
they will continue to be living in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; there the twice @-@ run family owner Frank Müller also grew up , his medical degree in Hannover followed in several medical offices as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently active as a senior pa@@ edi@@ atri@@ cian in Sul@@ ingen , when he was appointed senior atri@@ cian in Di@@ ep@@ holz in 2009 and is committed to volunteer in the DR@@ K @-@ willingness of Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
on 19 September the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ber , his pa@@ edi@@ atri@@ cian has worked , his wife UR@@ SE@@ L ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) specialized in the gastro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the Mü@@ llers , both Inter@@ nis@@ ts , are looking to settle for as a general practitioner . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out therefore , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
after conversion the rooms will be modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations and long @-@ term and load @-@ carrying EK@@ GS and need a intercom . more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a grant of a total of 50@@ 000 Euro has received the Mü@@ llers within a funding programme of the County of € 25@@ 000 , and of the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and glad we are , that the practice will be continued , &quot; says Sam@@ t@@ conven@@ er @-@ master Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , each quarter at the practice Fel@@ ar ausen , in the Northern German aver@@ xis , there are about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another general practitioner .
a positive side @-@ effect of the practice of practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to UR@@ SE@@ L D@@ isti@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no successor was found , it would have gone . &quot;
those who have long @-@ time Interphone series is also still appearing in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power from the fields of rock .
&quot; their departure ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all the medicine has practi@@ sed for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; said UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ast@@ ering g@@ mun@@ ching . &quot;
a little melanchol@@ y sen@@ sed them after the long time already .
&quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ bo@@ g and will see many patients still often , &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; her husband is supple@@ mented , &quot; We have a 6,000 sqm plot . &quot;
&quot; until now , I have always pushed into gardening that could be different now . &quot;
also the pair has two grand@@ sons and travels happily .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are pushed for even at our border line , &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister of Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
controls on the Hungarian border are in parallel with this .
&quot; clearly , it was clear that anyone who wants to put an asylum application , this could also do &quot; naturally . &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of the people are the highest priority .
&quot; but it is clear , however , that there are distinct signals , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; people need to know that we do not accept infinite migration flows , not about the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled operation .
Croatia pays off &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia
previously the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would like to res@@ train refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and also to establish cor@@ ridors for the refugees .
&quot; however , this is what the Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ head Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach would not be . &quot;
the idea of cor@@ ridors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensify the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot;
but the border with Croatia remains strongly controlled as the border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed me , Slovenia aims to seal the limits for refugees but not definite . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fill its commitments , otherwise the system cannot function &quot; , &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ head Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; like the Croatian government , the first refugees trying to travel to the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d in the night hours of Tuesday , to turn away the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could intervene in the near cor@@ se@@ fields .
&quot; according to local media since then in Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , we constantly monitor police vehicles with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days he reck@@ on his country with some 4,000 refugees , &quot; Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Bus@@ evo would be linked to the Maced@@ onian border , who previously had brought migrants to the Hungarian border in direction to Croatia , identified Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the government in Belgrade is to process that it is to artic@@ ulate some individuals to certain routes : &quot; &quot; we cannot , nor do we want to , nor do we want to do so , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; according to the media report , in any case , the first bus arrived in the morning of approximately 50 refugees in the Ser@@ b border town of Si@@ d , as many as other buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; Croatia , Slovenia and Austria according to Germany &quot;
the occup@@ ants had been on the road some 500 kilometres away from the Maced@@ onian border of Serbia throughout the night .
&quot; we heard that Hungary has committed to , so the police have told us that we are going to come here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to travel further to Germany . &quot;
this could actually be the predicted shift of the previous Balkan route to Greece @-@ Greece @-@ Greece @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west track .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive options for border control &quot;
&quot; Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously pointed out that his country prepared for the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees , corresponding plans for possible evaluations . &quot;
&quot; he called not he called , but he pointed out that Croatia , as non @-@ Schengen member , have &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot;
they conduct strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have gone through a good testimony to the country since its border controls . &quot;
on the Persian side behind the Hungarian border fence we still stand for around 300 refugees .
&quot; according to the media report , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
according to the Hungarian authorities the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
&quot; if the remaining refugees want to continue travelling to the Croatian border , it is not yet unclear . &quot;
&quot; the Serbian Minister of N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stefan@@ ovic also tried to so@@ ot@@ he with a local promin@@ ence in Hor@@ gos : he is holding the debate over alternative routes for refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for breakfast . &quot;
it would not be a matter of very high refugees .
&quot; they could not say whether they would continue their journey to Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise immigrants too - dangerous - aging
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee figure has already begun to distribute the refugees land maps , in which alternative routes are included in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border @-@ area , there are also 20 years since the end of the Croatian war that not yet sp@@ ched ( mine fields ) . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police were known that a team of min@@ de@@ mining companies were sent to the border region .
stock h@@ ackers : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
&quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok has been accused of having heard a ring of cy@@ ber crime , which has been thrown into , since 2010 , again and again at un@@ released financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Fire@@ Wire , Market@@ wi@@ red and PR news@@ wire . &quot;
with the exploited information the in@@ sider &apos;s business will be made on the financial markets .
it was thus that investig@@ ators were killed in a total of more than 100 million dollars .
&quot; the current comparison shows that even those outside our country borders will finally be trapped , &quot; &quot; says the S@@ EC communication . &quot;
it was more involved in the case against 32 other prot@@ esters .
most of the accused are from the Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetrators are supposed to operate in the USA and Eastern Europe as well .

you ste@@ er the two stations of the Mannheim Aut@@ os@@ al@@ ons at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
to run up in the city .
&quot; puls@@ ating , pr@@ el@@ ous life at great autumn sunrise and middle of it at least four large tables at each time with the heading &quot; Pre@@ or I die I &apos;d like .... &quot;
&quot; with this action , the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ ic@@ ity took our attention to its 20 @-@ year anniversary and looks quite confronted with mixed reactions . &quot;
&quot; it is life ; therefore we are in the midst of the action in the midst of the city , and among men &quot; says Jos@@ e@@ fine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the sponsor of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ ic@@ ity support is available for questions and discussions as well as volunteers are at your disposal .
&quot; while some pedest@@ rains breaks up for a chal@@ k and the sentence around &quot; &quot; my life &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; read &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; to stop &quot; &quot; with the camper &quot; &quot; to stop &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; do not last long , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m still reading , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again , the very edge of small discussions develop on the action of itself , about life , dealing with the dying . &quot;
also Peter Hü@@ b@@ inger is currently on site .
&quot; only when I realise that for me the end of this world comes , I can responsi@@ bly live , &quot; says the director of the di@@ ac@@ on@@ ical work in Mannheim , which is common with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband bearer of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical pat@@ ernity . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public figure is good for 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; so that not everyone wants to communicate openly with the tablets , but be understandable , finally it is a very personal matter . &quot;
&quot; the subject of death and death is still aff@@ licted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ e@@ fine Lam@@ mer , although the Hosp@@ iz@@ ers has done a lot in the last few years that humans open up too . &quot;
a evaluation compiled by the Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid .
&quot; dying as a funeral , belongs to the volunteers of the first hour . &quot;
&quot; through personal experience with the subject , they read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in mortality . &quot;
&quot; as the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ic hosp@@ it@@ aid by calling for volunteers , she immediately reported and was at the founding in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ li@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the interested party with members of private households , hospitals , nursing homes , and in the hosp@@ ice St. Vincent . &quot;
they all have been carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ ras@@ roid can be well handled with its job and the experiences and experiences made possible .
&quot; I see life from another war@@ ring , I think it is precious and like the moment , &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of the out@@ patient eyel@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ ic@@ ism is free of charge and denomin@@ ation@@ ally independent .
&quot; the financial support of the health insur@@ ers and donations of relatives and associations enable the training , as well as training and supervision of the student and ob@@ itu@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; every two years , training has been provided for new employees . &quot;
&quot; the signs described on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the Protestant Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) . &quot;
&quot; here also , other personal wishes on post@@ cards can be noted . &quot;
F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ results mixed and balance @-@ prospects for 2016 reduced
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appoint test results for the last quarter and the Lie@@ fer @-@ Gig@@ ant lowered his winning view on a whole year because of the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in his bo@@ wel sport service .
&quot; the company also said that it plans to hire approximately 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to score 50,000 sales workers responsible for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell over 2.5 percent in pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said , argu@@ ing a profit between 10,@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year that ends in May , 20 cent less than at the previous forecast . &quot;
analysts expected to give a survey of fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ . &quot;
&quot; the reduced prospect is despite the price increase , which must be on average 4.@@ 9 per cent , and in spite of higher conditions for the bo@@ ating movements of heavy and large packages that are collected in November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it nevertheless would expect the result from the previous year due to cost increase , higher revenue and due to growth in online trade . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company produces &quot; solid ground@@ ing , &quot; if you get the weaker than expected economic conditions , mainly in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for holiday employment have been announced one day later than those of the Rival U@@ PS , who plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , about the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million earned a total of 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; the earnings per share amounted to $ 2,@@ 42 per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of z@@ ags Investment Research addressed analy@@ st . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of well @-@ asked analysts expected 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has noticed a decrease in international Pri@@ oral transmission over the past few years that brought sales to st@@ agn@@ ant during his / her unit .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results with F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , sales rose by 29 per cent in the last quarter , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express Unit recorded a higher revenue , due to higher prices , while the result decreased due to higher labour costs in the cargo business . &quot;
&quot; in the Pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex has around 3,@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent among a record high on 11 June . &quot;
&quot; on the most expected conference last year , Federal Reserve Str@@ ate@@ es spend two days this week around a 27 foot @-@ ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time for the first time since nearly a decade to lift the benchmark . &quot;
&quot; comfor@@ ting over them at one end of the one , two @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed seat cover is a m@@ ural of the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ elles and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the central bank has a double mandate from Congress : maxim@@ ization of U.S. employment and prices stable standing stable .
but since the big recession F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an insufficient @-@ third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate might be the X factor in a decision that is too tight in order to pre@@ dict them . it &apos;s announced on Thursday if the U.S. economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled from the un@@ parall@@ eled stimulus through the immediate short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
&quot; though most of the data of the economy show that they are solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could make the more cautious F@@ ed representatives more anxious to increase this volati@@ lity by raising interest rates for federal government - and be it only around one fourth percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will first be the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lin@@ d@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ists at the Mak@@ c@@ ologist Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for an excuse to not increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification , &quot; said she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which in itself secur@@ es the financial market . &quot;
&quot; half of the econom@@ ists , who were recently interviewed by Bloomberg , have predicted an advertising rising this week . &quot;
&quot; financial markets expect to have a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that only gives a 30 % chance of increasing an increase . &quot;
&quot; this points to a decrease in the stock market , if the F@@ ed raises the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists blow the blow because they promise a further increase is far away . &quot;
on Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial average earning by 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or a 1,4 % on 16.@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 .
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations , that the F@@ ed @-@ policy maintains this set in this week , John Lon@@ ski , Chief Executive Committee at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the propositions at that point , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does , she would have to go very far in her explanation to re@@ assure the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic at panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argued that an adverti@@ ser would put on the financial markets , because they would remove the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act . &quot;
&quot; just a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow ti@@ ghtening of the mon@@ e@@ anic conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ elles had said in spring and early summer , that in this year , despite the discomfort of liber@@ als , it would be necessary for more economic progress , an increase in the proposition . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slo@@ wed down , the improvement of the labour market in this year was solid . &quot;
&quot; unemployment rate decreased to 5.@@ 1 % per month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage boo@@ sts have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although inflation was constantly under the annual aim of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason the temporary impact of much lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs it due to the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief Executive at Pan@@ theon Macro@@ economics . &quot;
but financial markets around the world appe@@ aled to the end of the last month after China had changed its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial average daily fell by more than 16 % amongst its highest , as investors had feared that a rein@@ car@@ ming of the Chinese economy would dissi@@ p@@ ate the global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered in this month , the Dow now has about 10 % below the onset of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ence influence the complex calculation , when you can increase interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy were not occurred during the past few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. staff . &quot;
&quot; now , he predicted that she will wait at least a month to get the impact better on her . &quot;
&quot; there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty about what will be the effect on the US economy , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the global economy is none of the cent@@ ri@@ an@@ ists of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved in their decision making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Fund has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous .
the mere reference to the then Ben S. Bern@@ an ke at that time in 2013 that the F@@ ed could get its mon@@ astic expansion into narrow &quot; narrow &quot; b@@ anded con@@ fu@@ sions on the globe .
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly being merged , the F@@ ed representatives may not only be expected to monitor the developments of others , but also for other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; its decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Sal@@ ary Kar@@ el , Head of the Global Strategy for asset management of company En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA . , noted this month , that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of super@@ reactions to financial market movements , which seem not to be linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; acker , a particip@@ atory member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which refers to the adverti@@ ser , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its benchmark interest in three sessions . despite reduced recognizable effects on growth in the U.S. , &quot; L@@ acker said . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representatives were und@@ o these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the market collaboration in 2008 , &quot; said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the committee for the interest of the Bank of England . &quot;
the recent turbul@@ ence not come close to this level . he said .
&quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation by raising fear of a raise , because the markets would get h@@ eck , &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still holds a double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it is time to hurry . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .

Petra H@@ eine is in her body and soul teacher .
&quot; even with their 74 sequences , they are still taught as well . &quot;
on Thursday she does it at the asylum seekers on the D@@ ill@@ inger street .

Brazil &apos;s pap@@ al society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organisation SP@@ RS tried to clear up women on shocking how important good nutrition during the breastfeeding period is . she does this with the presentation of images of babies which are painted with depic@@ tions of unhealthy foods painted with depic@@ tions of unhealthy foods .
&quot; mother &apos;s milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that babies provide all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the extra energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results indicate that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only suitable adaptation to the mother &apos;s needs . &quot;
&quot; a current study conducted under the direction of Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that healthy eating pregnant women actually concerns the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , a healthy diet of the child can have a negative influence on the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new amber @-@ sports hall
the Municipal Council approved the entry for the 2.3 million Euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof is allowed for solar installation fl@@ atter .
&quot; the planning for the long @-@ awaited turn@@ around in Bern@@ rie@@ h &apos;s harvest is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent community meeting , the construction was carried out without large discussion dis@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; in other things , the Committee had decided to rep@@ el a &quot; &quot; respectable &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion from the valid development plan below , among other things . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; it was necessary to make permission for a special design . &quot;
&quot; reveals to be a &quot; &quot; saddle @-@ roof with non @-@ native first and roof @-@ roof &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; background the planning is the intended use of the attic for solar facilities : &quot; this allows us to get a wonderfully large indoor house , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; for the &quot; liberation , &quot; it was once again a matter of roof covering , which for energy reasons - unlike in the development plan , should lie below ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; thus a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan needs no &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; for the construction plan - whereby the amber is more restric@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; this is not a recur@@ ring project , however : &quot; we do not create preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the athle@@ te centre at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the community and the S@@ V Bern@@ ade@@ zer .
at the cost , approximately 2.3 million euros are calculated . &quot;
subsidies are expected from school and retail funding .
&quot; in the next process step , the application for the 18 x 36 metres of large hall is now considered to be the exam . &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is expected to be closed earlier than planned - namely .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed as a new Doc@@ tor Director at the Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
the station and the majority of the staff move from P@@ ei@@ los@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this will see the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the Land@@ scape against Land@@ betra@@ y@@ , Andrea Jo@@ chner @-@ white . &quot;
&quot; the Supervisory Board will receive a decision on the ruling of the Supervisory Board , and the Board of Directors will meet next Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if plans are put into action , all of the nearly 50 employees would go to hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the overwhelming majority should move with fishermen and of the existing inside station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
&quot; the employees , who cannot come with to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so Jo@@ chner @-@ white . &quot;
the staff are informed of their plans .
&quot; does the change triggered the cancellation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who only since the beginning of the year &apos;s medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic is and now at a private experience in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; on the question of who is to take the succession , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came to the game , who was prepared to take charge of the line from 1 October and to move with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this takes in any case a &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; and a distribution of the offer in &quot; &quot; internal medicine &quot; , &quot; so Jo@@ chner @-@ white . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ aker and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the interior of gastro@@ enter@@ ologic disorders .
&quot; in the next two years , fishermen will be united with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees with its people , until next year the former hospital of the gro@@ wn@@ shaft , which has over 35 beds , has to be closed for almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the federal states had planned this for 2018 , as the current refurb@@ ishment at the Hospital Wei@@ l@@ heim was completed . &quot;
&quot; Cab@@ inet of Jo@@ chner @-@ white , who is also chair of the Supervisory Board , came against rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the Federal Reserve Board , will be used as an accommodation for asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; the closure I figure out . as it continues with the property , Jo@@ chner reed could not say , there are several reflections . &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ time care of the Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ haz@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ric .
&quot; what Bes@@ ser@@ ole could not happen to us , such an occasion does not come back , &quot; so Fischer over the Qu@@ asi @-@ Moving on the Le@@ ch , who was taken very positively and very understanding . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , which Fischer has been as a chief physician for over 30 years , has not been given . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; hospital P@@ ei@@ los@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has repeatedly been threatened by closure , departments were closed , for example surgery and Obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;

&quot; as a form of tat@@ suspected , a 20 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old , who confirmed the fact the mention of the body and the investig@@ ators found the discovery site of the body . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported on Sunday morning after they arrived at the eve after a visit of a autumn show in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen not how I came home .
in search of the young woman the investig@@ ators lay first on personal belon@@ gings of the victim .
&quot; in the surveys in the friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the bl@@ ending , a crime dropped itself against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; the alleged perpetr@@ ator led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ pse was found . &quot;
&quot; the cerem@@ onial un@@ heard the authorities were report@@ edly killed in the police inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ pse in the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the Haf@@ tri@@ chter , the investig@@ ators lay under it a blow to the burden . &quot;
the information on the near@@ er circumstances of the fact is to bring further investigation .
refugees needed outside the study : study warning about housing
the situation on the German housing market is tense .
more and more refugees are looking for an affordable place .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is faced with a challenge .
the distribution competitions on the German housing market have long since started .
&quot; with the coming refugees and jobs coming from the EU more and more people are pushing for a market , which is already over@@ bur@@ dened by many large cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ minded citizens in order to find the last affordable housing .
&quot; to cover the demand for affordable housing , we had to create 400@@ ,000 new units by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; according to this result , a study commissioned by the association &apos;s deb@@ ated &quot; social housing construction . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by comparison , this year , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units will be finished . &quot;
&quot; as a result , 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated to live as asylum seekers in an initial consultation . &quot;
&quot; many then come up in the apartment market , and set off in the long queu@@ es before the flats . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , in last year less than half of all asylum seekers came to rent . &quot;
the negative development of the housing market is not just due to the increasing pressure of refugees .
the study also makes significant om@@ issions in the housing policy of the last years .
Germany could be an apartment deficit in front of itself that is bigger from year to year .
&quot; up @-@ to @-@ date in the metropolitan areas around 7@@ 70@@ ,000 dwelling units , Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many professionals have therefore lived in large cities in W@@ G rooms .
young adults stayed longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot; because of the s@@ lu@@ te on the apartment market .
&quot; in the large cities , the number of square metres per head has declined in recent years . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; Social Stru@@ cture is Rel@@ aun@@ ching &quot; . &quot; &quot;
in this context new incentives are expected to boost social housing construction again .
so you could have dispens@@ ed on the tot@@ aling tax and the base tax for funded apartments will be extended limited .
&quot; furthermore , according to the alliance attractive tax @-@ making abilities are necessary . &quot;
the Centre for Refu@@ ge@@ es of the State Bank Kf@@ W lives on well with cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start was ended on Monday , with 18@@ 4 million Euros , more than half of the currently available around 300 million euros . &quot;
now the project could be increased .
refugees have free fall : Croatia and Slovenia set up a corridor
&quot; after Hungary , there is practically no escape to Hungary , more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; Zagreb An@@ no@@ un@@ ces , the transit across Slovenia to North without hur@@ d@@ les . &quot;
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia seeks to join the neighboring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian Minister of Interior , and if needed , we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
Croatia is not a Schengen area yet .
&quot; after the down@@ turn of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees arrived in Croatia to come from there to Western Europe . &quot;
500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik reports about the Croatian inter@@ sec@@ utes RT@@ L .
Hungary had concluded its border for refugees on the day of the day .
&quot; new laws , which occurred the same day , make virtually unnecessary asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot;
Croatia does not want to cause the refugees .
&quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic stated : &quot; &quot; they can go through , and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
but there are people who do not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police had picked up the first refugees at the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia .
&quot; most of the news were reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they arrived with the bus as well as with Ta@@ xen to the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival she would have tried to get on foot over the Croatian border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border the refugees meet not on the border .
&quot; but , the border poses other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
mine e@@ de@@ mining is now fast to create a secure passage .
&quot; after Hungary , after the closure of the border no more refugees arrive . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police were en@@ rolled 3@@ 66 . &quot;
just before Tor@@ p on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws provide the tran@@ scen@@ ding and damage of the bor@@ rows to a crime .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were therefore introduced in the southwest city of Sz@@ eged .
deployment of five years and deportation from the land im@@ prints up to five years .
&quot; according to the immigration office , one received a total of 94 Asy@@ a in the newly set @-@ up of the border , almost all - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; the applicants were 13 families with small children , as well as two elderly people . &quot;
on Wednesday morning there were even 40 refugees stopped .
&quot; practically , no one has a prospect to obtain asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; after Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; safe country &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the un@@ adulter@@ ated asylum seekers came to be there to be de@@ ported .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; transit zone &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke is found only a few hundred refugees . &quot;
the workers began to be stopped in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they gathered the rub@@ b@@ ish to leave the tens of thousands of people in the past weeks at the road@@ side .
pl@@ y@@ ments were disp@@ osed and one of the in@@ dep@@ ots in the bor@@ der@@ ort has been rebuilt .
&quot; at the end of this construction , no one wanted to express themselves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Austria will reach only a few refugees after conclu@@ ding the border between Serbia and Hungary . &quot;
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
&quot; around 20,000 migrants still lasted in the country . &quot;
around 1400 people are waiting for the trip to Germany in Salzburg .
the train traffic from there to Germany stopped at the request of German authorities in the morning .
in free@@ assing I would regularly meet smaller groups of refugees .
Mayor had &quot; str@@ anded &quot; over the borders
&quot; we were at the Br@@ ücken@@ fest on Sunday with the advent of people , when suddenly ten people were with travel objects at the entrance of the tent , so W@@ ern@@ el@@ one Mayor Alois Mo@@ ors . &quot;

&quot; on Sunday , because Germany was surprisingly closed on Sunday for the refugee flow with Austria , she was in W@@ ern@@ stein concluded , so the City , who offered his help and had tran@@ ged their cars with two further hel@@ pers and their cars across the border to the Middle Pas@@ ym . &quot;
before we had the un@@ hoped for guests first of all to be meanwhile with j@@ ause and drinks .
&quot; we said right , we will take her by car to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; that was , for us , of course , &quot; says Urban is in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot;
they were very grateful .
&quot; a man did not let it take , a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ ga@@ des . &quot;
&quot; this was really looking forward to us , &quot; says Urban . &quot;
&quot; the str@@ anded train@@ ni@@ ers were gone by an ICE in a regional train in Wels on Sunday night , to pro@@ claim it after the short @-@ term notice that the rail traffic was stopped to Germany , but still trying to cross the border . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional train arrived at the Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn . &quot;
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border @-@ border is generally high in the course .
the Br@@ ücken@@ fest association with the Bav@@ arian neighbors on Sunday soci@@ able , days before had a two @-@ brid@@ ge@@ ta@@ way - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has start@@ led me thousands of tens of thousands upon us is a logical result of hypo@@ critical politics :
&quot; instead of helping in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke right at the establishment of structures , the human@@ eness has eff@@ ected , our Chancellor continued officially and openly stri@@ cken the attitude of the Hungarian government towards the clearing of the Nazi regime . &quot;
Lei@@ d@@ tra@@ y &apos;s policies are not just those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic states now in the bor@@ der@@ regions .
&quot; the p@@ oul@@ ders will also be able to notice that the &quot; yellow land &quot; which she invited and welcomed , has nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a major challenge , given the continuing refugee streams and the approaching winter , to establish decent conditions for shelter . &quot;
&quot; and it will be one even more - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;

the government has used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen banker to raise recei@@ pts for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the Fir@@ st@@ ale Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got control in the control .
&quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he noted of his first success . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation of 20,000 refugees arrived on Monday after Austria was without a big land@@ line , &quot; Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; mastery . &quot;
&quot; the Interior Minister , however , spoke of a &quot; fragile state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , Konrad with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 Quar@@ ters in the Y@@ ur@@ ian year . &quot;
&quot; to fulfil the number , over the coming weeks 3@@ 5.000 accommodation might be found - 20,000 expected the federal states , 15,000 from the federal government . &quot;
&quot; if there are more refugees , we can create it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a case without a ground , &quot; &quot; Konrad . &quot;
he has already had talks with the governor .
they would have saved him for the coming refugees to create o@@ dd@@ lers for the coming refugees .
&quot; in Upper Austria it works fine , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP of Al@@ atar supported Konrad .
&quot; morning there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , thereby clearing out how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; big expectations of the asylum coordinator are also committed to the OR@@ F promotion , as we do . &quot;
individuals and uncomplicated accommodations can be found on the platform .
there are also hopes for hotels in winter empty .
Konrad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed the standards for the accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
&quot; in times @-@ times , it could not be that mer@@ arti@@ ci@@ ers must keep a certain height of the hand@@ cu@@ ffs or the size of the duties . &quot;
to a temporary time &quot; not@@ ch &quot; would have to apply .
&quot; that he was successful in the assignment of the Interior Ministry , &quot; founded Konrad with his experience . &quot;
I am a older gentleman who doesn &apos;t like to face the fal@@ se@@ dness without further .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er causing no cost to the Republic , as they explained . &quot;
your employees want to increase it to three to four .
my own sel@@ f@@ le @-@ search was still not successful so far .
finally Con@@ rad wanted to set up a container at the square Stephan@@ splatz .
yet there is apparently problems with the permit .
Linz calls for better partition
&quot; at present , no opening of the municipal sports halls and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; it is not necessary at the moment , as one can accommodate the people affected currently without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; however , other sites should be tested on their practic@@ ality for the emergency . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; criticism of the city chief will be committed to the division of the refugees within the Bundes@@ lands . &quot;
other districts have to do their part here .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer call with the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) the governor of Joseph P@@ ag@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday passed the further course of the refugee question .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer has assured me that the German borders will not be sealed .
the further trip of refugees to the Federal Republic will continue to be possible .
&quot; however , there are now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
special links with refugees from Germany will no longer exist .
&quot; however , the protective seekers would have brought to Germany with regular journeys . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , Fr . ever asked for greater solidarity in the refugee question . &quot;
&quot; that now Austria also leads to controls again in Austria , is a logical consequence of the action of Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ tas@@ tic is a question of time
the General@@ ate of the &quot; new ship@@ yard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially completed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of office and production buildings , the listed IT Group S &amp; T moved , the rest ( 2@@ 700 square meters ) shall be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area . &quot;
&quot; in the IT the smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; said S &amp; T leader Hannes Do@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he can imagine to invest in Star@@ tup companies in the New ship@@ yard and later acquire that one .
&quot; from the very outset , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - in which D@@ haus@@ er promises some things : &quot; the next Run@@ tas@@ tic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the site , € 3.3 million from the Tech@@ Center , which is part of a third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is watched by the Linz AG for 60 years on S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 2@@ 700 square meter base in the building are already rented , for a further 40 percent I will give it requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni In@@ hab@@ a opened a second shop in the arcade
in the new shop Fur@@ la pur@@ se is at the centre of attention .
&quot; in fact , Jut@@ ta wanted to set a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old In@@ hab@@ acy of Li@@ a Per@@ oni , in the Tau@@ ern market arcade , and finally it has become more awake in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , in which they sold among other bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and garments of different manufacturers , now all revol@@ ves around the Dam@@ en@@ hand@@ bags of the Fur@@ la , w@@ allets from 75 Euro . &quot;
&quot; larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in use since yesterday .
previously it was modified several weeks ago .
&quot; but I have wondered for a long time , whether I still want to open a shop , &quot; says broadly . &quot;
&quot; decisive for the decision was among other things , that even the Fur@@ la producers who are in Bologna at home , from the idea of a dedicated site where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the person@@ el in the Greater Region , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who made himself Italian roots . &quot;
your fashion concern has been wide ranging from her mother to the cradle .
I remember the most when something developed and I can show new trends for performance prices .
why so some woman in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag is in a tr@@ ance grip can not answer the house@@ wife with last security .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag can be upgraded any out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ Town
&quot; the Pf@@ al@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place , whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders . &quot;
this property links some even with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for Ex@@ c@@ ant .
whether it is spoken in the case of xen@@ opho@@ bic and scientist in international crisis policy - the applicant &apos;s candidate for the presidential election have been boo@@ sted in the election campaign .
and cuts out well on this .
&quot; this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ isches K@@ all@@ ville , where the grandparents of the real estate mil@@ ard@@ ess are her@@ ded . &quot;
the New Yorker with their bo@@ oming is many thanks to the wine f@@ k@@ dorf on the wine road .
man@@ ned in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant place is over -@@ ghty corners with it &apos;s presence .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ om@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the Elec@@ toral College . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ ador@@ ess Simone Wen@@ del became a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the villagers think of his end to becoming a powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find that somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their cold fashion style , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native bow@@ ler has an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous offspring @-@ loop , to which beside stum@@ ble also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , which is not known for mod@@ esty , is located in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ city &quot; ( 2014 ) Also in word - so with the statement that he would surely be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; to the king of the hearts , he did not put it there . &quot;
&quot; although I give respect for the performance of the family , but also ten@@ ure the opinion that Tr@@ ump is already a bit of a great pur@@ se , &quot; &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; in random the nickname , the K@@ all@@ city in the vicinity , &quot; The Br@@ lar jes@@ macher &quot; - in High German : the An@@ ders , tells them . &quot;
&quot; thus , Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of the An@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; the lac@@ ri@@ ump of success story began in 1885 , when the later grandfather passed away and opened a pub for gol@@ d@@ gers in the USA . &quot;
the foundation of the real estate company were first estate purchases in New York .
&quot; but the life of grandparents was not free of tragedy : her desire to return to his homeland , was silent on the Bav@@ arian State , which the Palat@@ inate at that time belonged . &quot;
&quot; he has not received Tr@@ ump , because he was once saved without permission , the Director of the Institute for Pf@@ alz History and Folklore , Roland Paul , made at the movie start . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emi@@ grant . &quot;
this is contrast to the occasionally striking statements of the post .
he had repeatedly talked of the import of Mexican immigrants in the US and requested to build a boundary wall to prevent illegal immigrants .
&quot; just as the polar , that is not so sympathetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a few m@@ umps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a n@@ ish Tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was saved Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
the winem@@ akers in retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ ancing the Americans : &quot; he is always so @-@ temper@@ ed .
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can not imagine this , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he has never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the Pen@@ si@@ mon@@ tin Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ r@@ amm mentioned as many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz was don@@ ed during a visit to the Church which was generally well beha@@ ved . &quot;
&quot; this can I not imagine by Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they were able to make it better if he doesn &apos;t know the choice , because &quot; he has such a radical view , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who were in the USA at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been as he , &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting subjects than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter , Sarah Kr@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my president is not it , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the president . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els Film , for which is being interviewed for a long time , have seen 12 000 Kin@@ o@@ go@@ ers , also in the United States aw@@ aken the interest . &quot;

&quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain@@ e@@ ering villages &quot; . &quot; &quot;
in the neighboring country the Alpine Club is responsible for the award of the award .
a &quot; mountain range &quot; must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .

Seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews despite the attempt of N@@ ine to take the loss of leadership in the Today Show
&quot; Karl Lieb@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son took to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report afterwards to the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but it has not seen any major shifts in the ratings for Today . &quot;
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the Federal Capital of Vienna as Mal@@ col@@ m turn@@ around abolished the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the Rival Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Samantha Ar@@ my@@ days , tasted in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international broad@@ casts , to which also Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cun . &quot;
&quot; this disadvantage of the board seemed to play no part for Australian TV spectators , since Sun@@ rise has posted an average 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators in the five capitals . &quot;
&quot; today generated a light increase compared to the ratings on Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind that of the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today in the last months the gap to Sun@@ rise has made .
&quot; in August today at the average 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 3@@ 30,000 from sunrise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year the distance ran between 40,000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; so far in September Sun@@ rise has risen at an average 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today . &quot;
&quot; this is the Most Inter@@ esting , which happens every morning . &quot;
the winds of change affect that morning more than the Parliament !

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar of Firefox to the Raf@@ as Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama of a recently @-@ we@@ ather@@ ed father , who exclu@@ des to settle with his two children in New Zealand , reached an impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers . &quot;
critics had asked if Thom@@ son encountered a hit @-@ show solo without the Rap@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; Yes . &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and hit easily The block ( 8@@ 38@@ ,000 ) and T@@ B@@ L Sh@@ outs ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;

&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 p.m. ) of the new Quiz show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe emerged on average 44@@ ,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;

the last three will correspond to that : Bachelor &apos;s Sam is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret finally revealed ? ...
&quot; Lan@@ a Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly obvious to who is The Bachelor wins . &quot;
&quot; the woman , with the Sam Wood continues to dwell in The bach@@ elor , was wrapped up in main secrecy . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not leave if it is the one that has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lan@@ a Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows one day before coming out of three two , you might have accidentally a note on who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood continues his lips until the final on Thursday sealed .
&quot; all three women have left themselves in a ly@@ ric way , why wood is the perfect man and he called his sense of humor , ambition , family values , and positive outlook as reasons why they like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who is to receive the last Rose ? &quot; &quot; could their answers to the toy , who won the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s heart . &quot;
&quot; Je@@ av@@ ons , Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki , both sty@@ led fast - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner in wood . &quot;
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with one another from day one .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and re@@ marked by Sam@@ s ) and Sam@@ s energies , because I felt that they were pretty compatible and I have thought of the whole course of the show &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing with both feet on the earth , it is so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood were well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her perspective M@@ ack@@ ay said , that the house visit last week was made clear to her that wood may be &quot; the One . &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m not looking forward to it now , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; when she was asked , who Wood should choose , if not her , there she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say it , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the left @-@ like girls equally - it is a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lan@@ a .
&quot; the Bachelor is held on Wednesday , 19 : 30 pm , on Ten . &quot;

Jar@@ y@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options starting to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent requests to his impressive open training day at the end of the last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a smart decision .
&quot; some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ nes for the rest of the game to the bank as he lost a sc@@ ram@@ ble , as was the Aussie &apos;s Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ ti@@ t on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota . &quot;
&quot; but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his man and gave it the next opportunity to a pun@@ t return , and also in the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula has continued to show his true appearance in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team by the mill , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula highlights Hay@@ nes also in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porters Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by his team of specialist Co@@ ordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who ri@@ et his ver@@ b to forget his b@@ ang F@@ ang and deal with his next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ y@@ d Hay@@ ne pat@@ rolled at a pun@@ t , which was restored in the first part of the Minnesota Vi@@ kings . &quot;
it was certainly not the start to get Hay@@ nes and its massive Australian Ge@@ fold dealer for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field behind the F@@ um@@ ble cur@@ ch@@ end the playing field and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine any worse starting in his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , one cares only about the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne lat@@ terly the car@@ ver with his Oriental debut back then in 2007 when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a Tr@@ y for Queensland .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

the free voters want to ask the freedom of refugees due to high refugees due to the attitude of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria .

but the record number of refugees now dominates the free choice of voters .
&quot; of course , the topic for asylum is super@@ imposed on &quot; &quot; St@@ wan@@ ger &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria and the same as it gave during the Yugoslavia wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; it does not go on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; said the Free elec@@ torate chief . &quot;
off @-@ off asylum seekers do not want to post@@ p@@ one the free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; for this reason , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts , who are responsible for asylum in : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum @-@ ers , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several states are not being consistent : &quot; we need nationwide standards of the Bundes@@ länder .

&quot; the subject of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all gymn@@ as@@ tics that want to use .

4 people killed by poli@@ c@@ emen on prot@@ esters in Nepal .
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police on rubber bul@@ lets against the proposed new constitution said , &quot; said a public servant on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke up on Tuesday evening in the district R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi , around 175 miles west of Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ phy , leader of the city &apos;s servants , said that more than 1,000 prot@@ esters were gathered outside a police station , with some of them stones and fire fighters . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police have deployed tr@@ end@@ eng@@ a and then shot down into the air before she resor@@ ted on rubber .
&quot; 20 poli@@ c@@ emen and five civilians have been wounded , &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately obvious why the used rubber bul@@ lets , from which it is known that they can be killing , but used traditional as a fatal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of non @-@ violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of the roy@@ alists argue that new provinces formed within the proposed new constitution will dimin@@ ish their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of the Th@@ ar@@ u states who want to have their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been operating in violent conflicts since the 10th century . &quot;
&quot; killed August , as the four major political parties signed an agreement that spl@@ itting the land into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which for centuries has been ruled centrally . &quot;
&quot; the work at a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; legislation voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft law in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
building area planned in the city
the plot of land at the Bor@@ ough of Alte Post is supposed to be built again .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of 4000 square meter surface .
&quot; planned is a mix of trade , commerce and living - concrete offers exist however . &quot;
Em@@ den - The city Em@@ den wants to market an approximately 4000 square meters of land in direct proximity to the Youth Centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
&quot; planned , to use the terrain for a mixture of commerce , commercial and living . &quot;
just wait for the corresponding offers on the part of the city .
&quot; which investor inquiry I come , is not yet clear . &quot;
&quot; finally , no contracts were signed . &quot;
&quot; the city Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is at the ring road / corner Great street , just a few months ago and you can rip it away from the building . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plantation on a holiday house settlement at the Small Beach near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor presented publicly plans for the project for the first time .
several An@@ li@@ eger people are further troubled - they fear the sale of their fl@@ ot@@ ment .
&quot; monthly days was behind closed doors , gr@@ asp@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday home located at the Little beach near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the field of interest , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ powered corporation &quot; System @-@ Bau &quot; &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday night in the urban development Committee on Monday night . &quot;
originally this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
&quot; under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP Group , the investors and managing intelligence agencies , Ralf B@@ hr@@ am moved from the System @-@ Bau management in the offensive : &quot; &quot; we did not have an answer to all questions , &quot; &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to encounter all the rum@@ ours .
that roughly ten to twelve million dollar projects have been in discussion for months .
&quot; fierce reactions among sea land@@ owners , who came at the meeting , sho@@ ots the pictures and new details about the hotel building . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , sea bu@@ ck@@ manager and manager in the stakeholders of An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ z that over@@ looks all the other bushes . &quot;
&quot; also , he also fears some other project critics that would benefit most of the traffic through the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; the whole bus inv@@ itations will come , so that &quot;
&quot; what exactly happens on the good a acres of the grand site of the former restaurant , is still open . &quot;
there is no operator .
only we have to have a coher@@ ent concept &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ á@@ t .
&quot; because this was missing , the development plans are still vari@@ abel ? &quot;

weight loss can be helpful for easily overweight diabetes .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for a minimum of five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery then live longer than those who are non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of the weight loss surgery , which has an editorial board to a new study in J@@ ama Surgery . &quot;
weight loss treatment or obesity surgery are used different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb nutrition .
&quot; over the years , obesity has been proven to be effective in the treatment of diabetes m@@ 2 @-@ Diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in human disease with a Body @-@ Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study the researchers were collected from Taiwan @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data which they collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of obesity , ga@@ stri@@ b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c tu@@ b@@ ance - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I below those who undergo this surgery declined from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I was with those who did not @-@ surgical diabetes treatments , roughly equal in 29 . &quot;
&quot; of those who are subjected to a surgical procedure , the type of diabetes was increased completely at 36 % , and at 28 % . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated Group , diabetes is completely dissolved with only one percent and in some cases with only two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , results were obtained in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols &quot; in general better than the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitoring the patient &apos;s blood levels of hem@@ at@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which is reflected on the blood sugar values over time . &quot;
em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c has best kept under 7 percent and write the researchers .
&quot; after the operation , the average tick &apos;s glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c has decreased by about 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
in the medical treatment group however it remained stable at around 8 percent .
&quot; but this improved &quot; &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as is reflected in the improved hem@@ ost@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease the mortality in five years , such as the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also performed average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight in comparison to the gas rec@@ tom@@ y group ( 7,@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ ost@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.6 % ) and reported rather a complete overthrow of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show survival benefit of surgery for five years , there is evidence from a study of grav@@ ated people in Sweden , that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who are subjected to an obesity , some 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study did not have an advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said , it was re@@ ass@@ uring for those with a BM@@ I below 35 which were interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation at this lower BM@@ I group is lower , without elevated risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
&quot; she added on Black@@ stone that people and her doctors should start taking weight seriously , as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we are waiting too long to bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think once they have accumulated those genetic changes that have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;
love @-@ story performed in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is a theme that is often due to this in the fic@@ tional case : a young woman , too school times un@@ solic@@ ited and un@@ si@@ ghtly , hits the warm of her youth after years and this one loves them in her . &quot;
&quot; also in the recently published Roman &quot; Ac@@ tually , we are not &quot; &quot; by Luisa Bin@@ der . &quot;
&quot; in addition to love history , the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ rück , because he plays in Long@@ wei@@ ler and the neighbouring villages . &quot;

it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe cannot record all refugees , &quot; the Dalai Lama says and added that the real solution to refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist leaders called for this to end violence in the home countries of refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of prolonged refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford who has dedicated to ethics .
he requested that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries has been admir@@ able in the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; though the Dalai Lama promised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in coping with the crisis , he stressed that there was just a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; getting to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you have to think about long term solutions like a genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he said . &quot;
ultimately we must think about how the killing in their countries is reduced .
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s actions following the attack of September 11 and concluded that the violent response from the US was a chain of un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able events .
&quot; after the September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences to President Bush in September , and I told him the way to resolve this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence and it came out of violence , &quot; &quot; the Dalai Lama promised . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of san@@ i@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
&quot; in the United States , poison@@ ing centres in the US report on a nearly 400 % increase in the number of children under 12 years of free ge inf@@ ect@@ ants such as Georgia Po@@ ison Centre . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of income from hand @-@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children aged under 12 , rose from 3.@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children always come more frequently to these products , and sadly , a percentage of them get in the emergency , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ate inf@@ ant drinking some children while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ t in social media .
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants can only drink for a cheap experience .
adolescents have report@@ edly mixed a dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with alcoholic mouth@@ wash in order to get a tougher drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive fragr@@ ances of the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child doesn &apos;t think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are sc@@ ented .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berries , grapes and oran@@ ges which are very appealing to children . &quot;
hand san@@ i@@ ti@@ zer contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in infants can already few sp@@ lash out of alcohol @-@ poison@@ ing .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ hand@@ ler &apos;s Hospital at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the station Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would not let the luck whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come from it , it is a quick way to consume much alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , that recently taken four Spr@@ ite from the straw@@ berry du@@ f@@ ten@@ ant in school was brought into an emergency . &quot;
&quot; the blood @-@ conduc@@ tion was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is lawful on an adult as well , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , who treated them at the G@@ win@@ der Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ jah spoke of her words , and was not able to walk when she arrived in the emergency . &quot;
&quot; doctors were monitoring them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen by the alcohol and hit the head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; this was very wor@@ ris@@ ome , &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ án &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez is recommended to parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
above alcohol @-@ poison@@ ing there were some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants associated with deaths .
&quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after the cho@@ p of de@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which has a toxic , not declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities suspect that the product Me@@ than@@ ol contained a deadly solution , rather than Eth@@ yl Al@@ co@@ hol , who has been noted as active substance . &quot;
&quot; in January of planned three students from the fourth grade in the State of New York , their &quot; &quot; common &quot; teacher to po@@ isons , by exter@@ min@@ ated anti@@ bacterial products for the lecture hall , &quot; it announces a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to de@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and comp@@ iles them out of their space .
the police arrested the failed plan as &quot; Gesch@@ aft &quot; and the discipl@@ ined efforts of the school authorities .

the lack of title competition in Scottish football te@@ aring low @-@ lands - de Bo@@ er
&quot; former Rang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former Governor of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er has said that the Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , since there is no title rival with the Rang@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; said Ms de Bo@@ er , currently a ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the ranks are not there .
people here are not just talking about the return of the ranking .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and this is what they are interested .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
I will take the things around and I have heard di@@ pped .
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic will have to fight , but the Norwegian boss shou@@ ld@@ st kill things . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat of Malmö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League followed the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who are now clearly at the top of the table with five points . &quot;
&quot; gentleman said : &quot; Celtic had already had a bad time before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know , it is very frustrating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel it exactly this way - but we must continue .
&quot; we really need the support provided by Celtic , because that makes the player better . &quot;
keeping up together is so important .

&quot; players who come during the summer , have this pre @-@ season time to integrate with what you saw with our own group in this season . &quot;

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged throughout the United Kingdom .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged for 16@@ 4,000 in the period from May to July , while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole rose during the same period of 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate is 5.@@ 9 percent above that of the UK@@ s at 5.5 per cent as the figures of the Office for National Statisti@@ cs ( ON@@ S ) demonstrated .
&quot; in the meantime , employment fell in Scotland at 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2.@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
the employment rate for Scotland came down to 7@@ 4.@@ 0 percent in the course of the quarter - a figure above the UK @-@ average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; the Permanent Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the Government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it &apos;s almost exactly a year ago that Scotland met the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have seen further improvements on the Scottish labor market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;

why I will be a tribute to O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; later today , except for late legal intervention , I will watch how a guy is being put to death . &quot;
&quot; if it happens and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in an audience @-@ gallery in the dark@@ room in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ sip will be rep@@ u@@ ated by the tox@@ ins . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses during his death .
&quot; the invitation took place in January about his best friend , and even though I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; as the day closer I began , I began to fear . &quot;
&quot; so , why should I do it ? &quot;
I agreed because I thought it would be a great way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would provide a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see testimonials in the USA , and since there are often more applications than places available , a flaw@@ less lottery will take place to decide which is chosen . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of critics from 12 to five .
&quot; who will be selected , it will be emotion@@ ally observ@@ ant . &quot;
I can &apos;t do that .
&quot; next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , I will sit with my own relationship , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two @-@ hour visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we talk .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not allow me to record a notebook and a pen , to record what I see . &quot;
I simply have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of the conscience , as he wants it , and you get access . &quot;
I describe myself with her .
&quot; she thought that she &quot; &quot; could have been better artic@@ ulate &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks that it is false , what I do . &quot;
Richard Com@@ sip had problems with some of the things I have said and written .
&quot; he does not say to me what to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me at all times from his list of witnesses .
but he wants that an international re@@ porter is present to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement against the death penalty will help . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ y@@ ware , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is located next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the event , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go here again on all details .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ sy is innocent .
his acts after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benefici@@ ary of action .
&quot; but I believe that there is a strong likelihood , that it is not guilty of the murder . &quot;
I believe it is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
I can not claim to be really obj@@ ectively .
there will be other re@@ porters to which you can turn to for this .
&quot; what you get from me is , what it means to see a man killed an unnecessary death . &quot;

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards would try to pick him off and he is threatening to end the racing sport
&quot; Peter Moo@@ dy claimed that Ste@@ ste@@ wards in Racing Victoria have been trying to install a sp@@ y in its stables , and in the past year , I have been able to finish the race immediately . &quot;
&quot; he took on the ste@@ wards and the integration department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy said Mr. Moo@@ y says that he is always trying to do what is best for the racing sport and when he had found himself under difficult conditions , when it came to the positive cob@@ alt T@@ up@@ swing at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had held back 18 months due to the es@@ pi@@ onage allegations , and did not want it to be &quot; out as to high @-@ grade grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had before nothing to say about this , and I have been eating a lot for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that all at once comes out , &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy . &quot;
you know that it is far .
&quot; sometimes one respon@@ ds , and one has to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I shall go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to walk in the head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; when they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be a trainer . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; Moo@@ dy &apos;s previously had Moo@@ dy &apos;s the bomb into an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integration department had tried to pick up his stable . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart led in a room with a man - I will call on - and offered him a job in my stables , to deliver information about what I do inside my stables , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they clearly believe that I am a fraud .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly put themselves to their n@@ oses , because they have failed to touch me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , President of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at that time and still are today . &quot;
should I consider myself that it &apos;s going to be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L co@@ ves and are perhaps responsible for doing so outside trainers what is happening in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking out there that I am .
&quot; perhaps they need to take my license and do not hurt me , and I have no doubt that what I say now letting them think about it now . &quot;
&quot; but I have reached the point at that point where it doesn &apos;t care , and that makes me sad . &quot;
this really makes me sad .
I will exercise their pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the trainers of the coach can be built with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt investigation in Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led me that he was able to throw his license via the table . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy &apos;s best known as Moo@@ dy &apos;s best known by his preparation of the un@@ sealed master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , after a pack of mud or sound applied to the horse as a trial , which ble@@ w against the rules . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot;
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has mistak@@ enly mud on the leg .
it would have been like that night .
it could have been like this all day long as it was like that .
but it also had so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy might face a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with a pack carrier . an examination of this case has been opened .
it is a joke .
&quot; people who set up these rules , do not know about the horse . &quot;
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here one has gone too far &quot; , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
man who had been arrested for driver
on the weekend the police arrested a man after a clash with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent driver &apos;s companions in Cob@@ ram .
the cycl@@ ist was supplied with helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley .
&quot; the police said , the driver drove further , without stopping , to help the injured driver . &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig R@@ amy is fighting with ri@@ vals because of allegations of ring
&quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig R@@ amy has critic@@ ises his player as &quot; &quot; Agenda &quot; &quot; by two Premier League &apos;s favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L . &quot;
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee will have allowed the Storm player &quot; ring@@ ing &quot; with his team during the high Storm seal in yesterday &apos;s finale in Sydney on Friday evening .
&quot; Bris@@ bane Bron@@ co Train@@ ers Ben@@ nett Ben@@ nett really made a glimpse of the Storm Team , celebrating his team winning the final victory against North Queensland Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland are not &quot; too good &quot; in the cycle . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ ac@@ cre@@ ws defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said she is concentrating only on their &quot; contact &quot; at the T@@ ackl@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers per of his team strongly agree with him , because it means that they were worried about the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; it always emerges , I didn &apos;t ever hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about wa@@ ist struggles than they told us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ ella on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that nothing changed anything from the defensive system or the techniques throughout the year . however , in the last six weeks we have made our contact with T@@ ackl@@ es for a real main focus , and this has provided us with the turn of the trend . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . therefore , he probably does not lose weight so it was a bit of shock for him . &quot;
it &apos;s quite funny as this time is emerging again and again at this time of time .
&quot; Bell@@ yon has attacked Ben@@ nett from &quot; thrilling football &quot; and his ment@@ or reminded that Ben@@ nett is St George Il@@ j@@ ni@@ v@@ ra Dra@@ gons to win the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football . &quot;
Way@@ ne is talking about exciting football .
&quot; he had made his play on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ ella . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 , St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of a s@@ fil@@ th . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially its young players at their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play if you have these types of players .
&quot; he did this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of soccer ball - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play them . &quot;
&quot; I build your trust , because they say these things , because they are a bit worried , to play against us . &quot;
they didn &apos;t think of us six weeks ago when it was about the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the match against R@@ oo@@ sters obtained a higher result than the game of bronze against Cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the outcome ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts at our game , but is this an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks doing there and do not have any points of cl@@ ans ?
for me it is the schedules .
&quot; when they mention , it means that we will meet them at a stage . &quot;
&quot; the Storm team has free on this weekend since they have the right to receive either North Queensland co@@ w@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks , on the next Saturday night in the semi@@ finals at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin on next morning tomorrow . &quot;
Ser@@ bi@@ er with 200,000 $ deposit according to drug costs
&quot; a man who could possibly be a li@@ felong sentence due to his trial , to get into the ownership of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine which has been smug@@ gled up by Queensland , was released against a deposit of 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested the last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America to Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and ended in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed and observed his co @-@ def@@ endants in the course of the afternoon and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era road @-@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
&quot; despite having a possibly vital penalty for trying to own a commercial lot of co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ing the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic that there was no evidence that he has tried to possess the whole quantity and that in the café , there could have been a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter P@@ agan , was worried about the danger of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he stated the court on Wednesday . &quot;
in the pen@@ al cause he took the police over his place of residence .
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s mother and step@@ father had offered a security of 200,000 USD as security together to achieve its release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ id@@ av@@ able explanations of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of a 200,000 dollar face a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; says Richter re@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone is not sufficient to prevent him from it , not to appear , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he gives his Australian and his Ser@@ b passport , carrying out to the police on a daily basis and considers itself at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A@@ 5 at Karlsruhe : a leader needs apart
&quot; for a shelter with three trucks on the highway 5 at Karlsruhe , on Tuesday evening a truck driver has been severely injured . &quot;
&quot; two of the three contribut@@ ors took place in front of a permanent construction site , placed in the direction of Basel . &quot;
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late and tried to turn left in vain , at the last moment to the left , as the police were middle @-@ over . &quot;
the leader of the in@@ vert@@ ebr@@ ates completely apart .
the driver was badly injured to a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 hours .
&quot; the result was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 Euro . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used by girls in order to enti@@ ce ped@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a ped@@ ophi@@ le challenged the phone of a 11 year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg was taking the phone of the girl when this fell , log@@ es into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children which were sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl woke later on and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of sle@@ dding Ho@@ gg .
&quot; she saw it , found the confusing messages and aler@@ ted immediately her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of it and looked at the five pictures , analysed then computers that were found at the address and discovered &quot; &quot; web research &quot; &quot; used for the search for in@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ gg pre@@ judicial to the officials that he would have done so as &quot; &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet &quot; &quot; and he then &quot; &quot; started to be a poli@@ cem@@ an to sc@@ are her . &quot;
&quot; the At@@ ten@@ ant E@@ ili@@ ac Rober@@ t@@ son said to the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court , &quot; &quot; he said it would be an addiction , - that it is addic@@ tive to sc@@ are people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that searching for the computer were conducted by him , but said it happened , because he wanted to hold a poli@@ cem@@ an to fri@@ ghten the ped@@ ophi@@ le . &quot;
&quot; he was asked about his conversation with the unknown person who sent his pictures , and he requested to send even more photos . &quot;
he said that he did it to enti@@ ce them .
&quot; he said he was sick in mind when he drinks , and he said he would then see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ t@@ son said : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on the tre@@ mb@@ ling and on the we@@ eping . &quot;
she then saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confront the accused .
&quot; the girl was interviewed and said , that the accused will use computer and Play@@ station to speak to girls who saw much younger than him . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ ys , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , ple@@ aded not guilty as guilty of the indictment , rejected without further images of children on 14 June , and to have appeared before court during a hearing on 24 March of this year . &quot;
&quot; defense attorney Gregor S@@ im asked for that Ho@@ gg is not appearing in the Register of S@@ exual Re@@ conci@@ liation , since they argue that &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; can be found in his approach . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Al@@ ist@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael disappeared if the judgment is sent to October to obtain background reports on social work .
&quot; Ho@@ gg was granted in this case , but was held for hear@@ ings to other still in custody . &quot;
he was admitted to the Register of the Women &apos;s Day before the date of judgment .
fla@@ x soft at small border cross@@ ings in Germany
more and more refugees are being taken up aside in the Franco @-@ Austrian border .
many locks left out of fear of discovery and detention of people prolon@@ gs smaller border @-@ operations
&quot; on the Austrian side , a speaker at the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; along the border river Inn , the land @-@ circles of Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn have since Tuesday took over 1,000 refugees . &quot;
they were walking on the German side on foot .
there they are registered and passed on by the Federal Police of the Federal Police .
the federal police station at the Munich central station met again for more refugees following the weekend of the weekend on Wednesday .
&quot; until the 8.00 am to be around 700 people in the state capital , said a narr@@ ator in the morning . &quot;
after the re @-@ introduction of inspections at the German @-@ Austrian border reached the town on Tuesday 17@@ 59 refugees .
Stuttgart : prec@@ urs@@ ors of Tro@@ pen@@ ght &quot; Henry &quot; in the South@@ west expected
meteor@@ ologists warn of stor@@ mb@@ ling in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area of Western Europe , warm sea @-@ air is currently distributed in Stuttgart , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the strong rope was the sp@@ urs of the tropical @-@ stur@@ ms &quot; Henry &quot; that , over the past few days , be drawn from the Bermuda Islands . &quot;
fierce storms and str@@ or@@ m are mainly expected in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D , until Thursday morning , also in the Black Forest , on the Schwä@@ lim@@ bic Al@@ b and at the sea coast , with bucks from 60 to 90 minute @-@ kilometers is expected . &quot;
the sun reveals to be shining on Friday .
the mass makes it : every two years the car@@ makers on the I@@ AA show their novel@@ ties .
2015 is mainly a venue with the compact car rentals which are currently particularly well sold .
cars from the compact class are currently especially asked : about 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were calculated out of the force office ( KBA ) in August alone in August .
this is also reflected in the I@@ AA ( public stage 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new luxury cars and luxury cars are presented in this year especially many new compact models .
one of the largest premi@@ er for the German Autobahn project is an Opel A@@ stra that will be on sale in autumn .
&quot; the A@@ stra is a extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel @-@ CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it is at the heart of the brand .
&quot; the increase of the volume was also well sold , the new A@@ stra should not become much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel is part of the biggest competitor VW Golf in view , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current A@@ stra costs starting from 16 € 9@@ 90 euro .
the A@@ stra is available with a new 1,4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 HP .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse offers further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 HP up to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder petrol engines . &quot;
unlike the most important competitor VW Golf and Ford Focus there is the Opel A@@ stra just as fifth .
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of Kom@@ bi , which is also already visible on the I@@ AA . &quot;
and what will be covered by the A@@ stra on the I@@ AA remaining in new cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its A@@ stra @-@ competitor Mé@@ gan@@ e in the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is employed exclusively as one @-@ fifth in a conventional and high sporting GT version . &quot;
&quot; in the trade he comes at the beginning of next year , then also as a wagon . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ spin@@ offs intend to find in the new model in the rapidly growing segment .
&quot; yet , the compact infin@@ iti fits with its curved lines fully into the design principle of the brand . &quot;
the basic model will get a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
&quot; on offer , there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 PS or 125 kW / 170 hp . &quot;
&quot; Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1,@@ 0 @-@ liter turbine and an output of 82 kW / 111 PS . &quot;
the maximum torque is due to manufacturer information in 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is spring 2016 .
&quot; Ds 4 : not quite new but completely restored is the compact model DS 4 , which is visible at the I@@ AA . &quot;
&quot; outside the interior , the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers laid hands on the front line : here the cooling pilot was drawn up and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the Inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment@@ system was moderni@@ zed , when the number of buttons is reduced by touch screen and is the first time Ap@@ ples Car@@ play . &quot;
&quot; added to the I@@ AA in the compact class , add a number of re@@ work and new variations like the refres@@ hed Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 GT@@ I . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cells are un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ prisoner of the judiciary , which has been occupied by months in one to small cell . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are generally entitled to compensation if they are accommodated in small cells . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this has decided the Court of Constitutional Court on a non @-@ published decision . &quot;
persons affected may even hope for money when they were imprisoned just a few days in the close quarters ( A@@ z . : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
&quot; thus , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was able to accom@@ o@@ date in a single unit with approximately five square meters in space ; the toilet was not sealed off . &quot;
&quot; then the man , who , according to his lawyer , has now been restored to an independent base in a larger cell . &quot;
his off@@ hold charges due to the un@@ worthy prison conditions against the country of Berlin failed .
&quot; however , the ruling arbitr@@ ators raised the ruling on the Berlin Tribunal and rejected it back in the case of renewed examination . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s dignity is injured .
Kammer@@ tribunal will now decide on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons from the temporary period only a few days of Haf@@ tt@@ age were decisive for the compensation , a balance was made , it meant . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , it would be a mist@@ re@@ ous of the mis@@ sal protection of the personality . &quot;
the chamber level must now clarify the amount of un@@ locking damage .
the constitutional rec@@ ti@@ fier often have often reinforced the rights of prisoners .
&quot; they did not say to a prisoner of in@@ mate , because he was naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; crowds of people make a decision from 2011 , including the multi @-@ branch in@@ fle@@ ction of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in addition , the Berlin Constitutional Court also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , the prisoner of a prisoner in a parall@@ el@@ ism in November 2009 had an un@@ decent accommodation . &quot;
the then compl@@ ain@@ ant was fed a day between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell like in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin prisons were also issued in recent weeks because of missing staff in the headlines .
&quot; prisoners are therefore always open 23 hours , the aggres@@ siveness rise , even for r@@ ams it should be already due to the tense situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the Justice of Justice , 21 positions in Te@@ gel could not be occupied for offspring of offspring , 19 are supposed to fall off . &quot;
&quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; we create the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to take care of it .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; about 800 000 asylum seekers are coming to Germany according to the Federal Ministry of Represent@@ atives this year , according to the declaration of vice chan@@ cell@@ or Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees . &quot;
&quot; speaking of Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) , given the unusual challenge , &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can create it and we create it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is zu@@ by in Germany gives the following overview .
&quot; according to various forecasts range between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Commerce ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institut ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) units annually - over the next five years . &quot;
that is almost twice as much as it has been constructed ( 250@@ 000 flats ) .
&quot; the lack of living space , but especially for affordable rent @-@ properties : 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing come out of the rental rate and in order to apply this particularly favorable conditions to refugees . &quot;
&quot; as a result , Federal Minister of Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SD@@ P ) intends to double the support of currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing needs to arise and this is , the federal government would have to invest in the amount of € 6.@@ 4 billion per year . &quot;
agree that scientists and Federal Minister are agreed that there will also be more tax benefits for investment in the residential construction .
&quot; according to the Institute for Employment Research ( Employment Research ) , 55 percent of the refugees have been able to operate in Germany over the long term . &quot;
&quot; unlike the qualification in Germany , the refugees in Germany would not only be asked to help them get started , critic@@ ised Claudia Walter , project leader for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Stiftung . &quot;
but it is critical for the integration of refugees because they find jobs in Germany .
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the reception company , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the migrants , &quot; says migration expl@@ orer Diet@@ rich Thr@@ es@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , it has given a political shift in Germany : from work ban on refugees to recognition employment . &quot;
&quot; while in the past there was a work ban on asylum seekers of up to five years , this November 2014 was reduced to three months , as well as the Residen@@ ze , asylum seekers in November 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in society , also because of the skilled workers - it mostly gets imposed on the perspective that refugees should be able to gain access to the labour market in a faster basis . &quot;
a major barrier to access to the labour market is a lack of German knowledge .
&quot; so far , there is still no comprehensive offer of general and CP@@ D @-@ related language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs most often be conve@@ yed by personal contacts .
the establishment of networks is therefore a view of Thr@@ es@@ hardt in the Royal Road to work integration .
&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugees spend their children in the nur@@ ture , estimated at ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the root @-@ rooted parents it is only once quite important to hold the family , &quot; &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ ep@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in Berlin Senate Chancell@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , managing the advertisements in several languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators should increase greatly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - by increasing more professional schools . &quot;
in the countries students are prepared without German knowledge of welcome classes on classes .
&quot; they are not always taught by fully trained teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ alle from the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk is estimated that approximately 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; fundamentally , no state asylum seekers or commemor@@ ations the study - the only exception was Berlin , In@@ sen@@ ator Frank Hen@@ kel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his position . &quot;
study Members could be facilitated by access to the university .
&quot; after all , refugees with a residence permit or D@@ ul@@ estation do not receive any services according to the asylum @-@ law law , if they begin studies . &quot;
&quot; they generally receive no BA@@ Fö@@ G , because they don &apos;t fall under the circle of the eligible persons . &quot;
&quot; toler@@ ated refugees had to come into Germany for four years to date to be entitled to BA@@ Fö@@ G @-@ eligible , from 1st January 2016 to be shortened to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but these financing costs must be closed , however , ask Steff@@ en Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many the religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should succes@@ sively impact Islam through the same rights as they have the churches , and developing the existing state @-@ churches to a new state of religion . &quot;
&quot; it would also be important for the establishment of an Islamic welfare association , who takes care of new arrivals . &quot;
among the rights are also obligations .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam should be on a clear point of contact and be willing to work with the state in many areas and to give him some control options . &quot;
that includes willingness to heed religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the chairman of the Central Council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , have vo@@ iced the concern , religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to leave such conflicts in Germany immediately , &quot; have their right to be here in Germany , &quot; he said at Bay@@ rische Rund@@ funk . &quot;
he suggested that the Basic Law was transl@@ ating into Arabic .
&quot; in future , integration will be much more likely to be a topic of society as a whole . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is also more pressing . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , as a result of European decisions , there has been an anti @-@ discrimination object for a decade and a general gender equality law . &quot;
&quot; however , very slowly , as the NS@@ U @-@ M@@ ord@@ serie showed , in which police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motive . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and stak@@ eholder meetings are demanding a long time , and to commit to international agreements like Anti@@ rac@@ dic@@ ation in Germany , must become reality in the coming years as the country peace@@ fully and its new citizens should take advantage of its possibilities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to provision for the so far @-@ expected refugees , &quot; says Doc@@ tor &apos;s president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; regarding Man@@ kind Power and capacities , we create that , &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; that would , however , need additional money to flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , all com@@ ers equal in the registration of health cards . &quot;
these services could later be cancelled later to the federal states .
&quot; in the long term , it is most questionable , so many people cover the limited power catalog , that the asylum seekers can be seen . &quot;
otherwise the physicians recommend learning to provide language barriers .
&quot; even so far , the Berlin health scientist the@@ a Bor@@ de has already proven that migrants are worse about their disease than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only at clinics , also in physicians who would have to be taken over , demands her . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees too were helped with more general medical procedures in emergency out@@ patient . &quot;
and with a different diagnostic view .
&quot; among refugees whom there are approximately more un@@ paid disabilities , and in the youths it is about HIV education . &quot;
&quot; with these other path@@ ologies , German doctors came from their training but clear , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; the paras@@ ite inf@@ estation , or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not so difficult to see . and what affects the nu@@ des , is through the refugees away even to allevi@@ ate the cause . &quot;
&quot; the Syrians had a highly developed education system , and a number of refugees even are doctors . &quot;
&quot; to practice women , they would have to post@@ p@@ ate their qualification and make no tests for possible tests . &quot;
least half of the refugees in Germany are about for estimates of the post @-@ psych@@ otherapy treatment ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psych@@ ologically ill : most of them suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress @-@ compul@@ sive disorder or depression .
&quot; being vulnerable to refugee , Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , president of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study done by the Technical University of Munich is that every fifth of Syrian refugee quot@@ a has been traumati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; who is suffering from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress @-@ resolution suffering , suffers from among others to so @-@ called Flas@@ h@@ backs with brea@@ ths , di@@ zz@@ iness and death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms are sle@@ e@@ pl@@ - and concentration of concentration , strong out@@ ste@@ er and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms would be chron@@ ically , be an early treatment necessary , explained Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; however , only four percent of psych@@ ologically ill @-@ sick refugees get a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although psych@@ ically sick , asylum seekers can take a request for psych@@ otherapy , but it usually takes place several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in those cases the welfare workers or doctors who are not educated to the psychological disorders are deciding if a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this lead often to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites to dream
&quot; with the new performance &quot; passion , &quot; Cir@@ cus gave way back to the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to draw any age group in the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sings and its unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites in the arena on the tiles and was@@ ps to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine without living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; said Stephanie Pro@@ bst , ti@@ ghter and junior @-@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this slogan is the current management staging .
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus is in the hands of the family .
the gift for inspiration is thus in the blood .
&quot; it is important to take away the people from their usual trouble and to take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; stressed the 27 @-@ year @-@ old j@@ uni@@ per . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ con@@ cord with world city flair , &quot; thus Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst looks at his concept . &quot;
&quot; now , 50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometers long tour can now experience this flair . &quot;
the Cir@@ cus program attracts talented artists from around the world .
&quot; excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v Clo@@ wn Family moves the audience with wit and charm in their spell . &quot;
the top Brothers can understand their craft .
with the heroes of the stun@@ ted films the Cub@@ an duo wants to appear .
&quot; light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words , they identify themselves . &quot;
their hum@@ orous art on the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s p@@ ups in the storm .
besides numerous Black Sal@@ ad@@ ven the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Cir@@ cus gave also also with finger@@ tips and joint .
with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on one bul@@ let br@@ ats ?
for He Yuan no problem .
sn@@ are fascin@@ ate and terri@@ bly at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little other and fascinated with their flexibility .
some 60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; empha@@ sizes Stephan@@ ies Mother , Brig@@ itte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
mis@@ hes in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often issues with different animal protection organisations .
&quot; Stephanie Pro@@ bst also takes position at it : &quot; &quot; it does not go well to our animals , it is also not good for us . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every stro@@ lling unit .
&quot; the &quot; four @-@ legged artists &quot; , &quot; as they are called lovingly , is according to the possibility of every wish of the eyes . &quot;
we want to work with animals and have fun with them .
&quot; feel the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want it into the ring . &quot;
&quot; so , the great commandment was : good for the animals provide . &quot;
&quot; specifically on her z@@ eb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ Pon@@ y@@ h@@ st and a Zeb@@ ra@@ mare , the family is also proud . &quot;
the two animals have lived in a en@@ closure for eight years and nothing has happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our small jum@@ bo was there , &quot; says Brig@@ itte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the z@@ eb@@ roid is not yet ready for the ring , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Cir@@ cus arena . &quot;
so for every visitor something might be something there .
&quot; one thing is certain &quot; &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , &quot; whether 5 or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot;
Cir@@ cus Trial invites 17 to 20 September every day at 17 and 8 pm .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 16 o &apos;clock .
&quot; Thursday is the Family &apos;s Day , the prices at 5 p.m. are discounted prices . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the animal welfare is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Sim@@ pl@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe gives wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , dropped down from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; last but last , he quickly became aware of the social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the parliament was also clou@@ ded by allegations of members of the opposition that would have received anonymous deaths , and warned that prior to Mr Mu@@ gabe and Mr Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the month , they had joined him and inter@@ rup@@ tions during his speech to the State of the Nation - this is a speech which he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
the spokes@@ man for the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven op@@ positions messages must receive SMS messages on their mobile phones that they warned from before Mr. Mu@@ gabe .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it reported the title &apos; death &apos; , he told journalists after the reported speech . &quot;
&quot; it warns the members of parliament @-@ members , that immunity in the parliament ends , and as soon as they leave the parliament , parliamentary immunity are no longer effective . &quot;
chief spokes@@ man said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i &apos;s Party is &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers for the politicians .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is used up to 30.000 jobs
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30.000 jobs in the framework of restructuring and savings @-@ up efforts at the company &apos;s services .
HP is later part of this year in two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and its services .
&quot; expected job creation leads to a load of more than 2.@@ 7 billion in the fourth quarter , said HP in one statement . &quot;
&quot; this restructuring measures will allow a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard enterprise , &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ President and Chief Executive , which should lead the unity into separation . &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise is smaller and stronger than it HP is today , and we have a wide and abundant portfolio of businesses that support companies with transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
&quot; as a stand@@ alone company , we are better positioned than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be enhanced , integrated , integrated technology solutions for companies so far , &quot; giving an explanation of the company . &quot;
&quot; it shares a company that was founded in the 1930 &apos;s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill He@@ w@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard , in order to build elec@@ tro @-@ systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto is called &quot; the birthplace of the Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has managed a massive restructuring to handle the removal from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; the measure from HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area that is based on the belief that closely focused companies perform better performance . &quot;
&quot; FC arsen@@ al captain Mi@@ cle Art@@ eta said , that team @-@ mate must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere . &quot;
&quot; So@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September , and if his rehabilitation is according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas . &quot;
this optim@@ ism actually means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss the next four games for England and in view of its history its involvement in the next summer on the European Championships is sure to be uncertain .
&quot; the big shame on this issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had greatly ended the last season after a separate com@@ lement , and then returned to his old momentum during the low season . &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury is threatening the career &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
it is a bone that is not well @-@ healed .
it is not a big matter .
but that was just an accident .
it was not in touch with the dum@@ pl@@ ings or injuries he had previously had .
&quot; this may be true from purely medical point of view , but as acknowledged as turning , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player attempts to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops a uncomfortable pattern .
investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has had a total of 23 different disorders of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
&quot; he also played in only 65 of arsen@@ als , 157 lig@@ asp@@ ens play in the last five seasons . &quot;
&quot; the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight hours since 2007 / 08 , who have attended most vulner@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; maneu@@ vers accepted the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that improvement in the risk of injuries during the last season will last . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable time period , a time when you have to strengthen your body and win fight power , &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening to Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ track next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger presents itself with rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud in place of Sli@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need it to get a little break @-@ up , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; although Arsenal won clear favour@@ ites , the Mak@@ si@@ mir &apos;s stadium in Zagreb is one of the slots with the largest intimi@@ dation in Europe . &quot;
dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after the &quot; un@@ defeated &quot; campaign in the last season has started .
&quot; the stadium was shaken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake , where on the Richter scale . &quot;
this year it was 10th place in Zagreb .
&quot; So@@ ger is the opinion , that Arsenal won the lesson from the past season with the Champions League chapter to Monaco and has been pushed back by the distant hope , with his management to lead the association for his first European apo@@ cr@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never folded in arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not a dre@@ amer . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show that gives us serious lessons of men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar representations in shows is evident , especially with regard to how the need for men to open themselves , now more dist@@ res@@ sed than ever has become , how self @-@ mor@@ tar by young men on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains common in men than in women . &quot;
&quot; trying to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ern ( CAL@@ M - campaign against a pi@@ tiful life ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to question the men to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to master this challenge .
&quot; a recent study on more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mind &quot; , its chances of recovery has doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those not depressed , own@@ ing a circle of mental healthy friends the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to have friends so that a friendship may function .
&quot; in the age of more than social media communication , focusing on the matter of substance , the im@@ pass@@ age@@ ability of the response times is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lifestyles have the need to be strong , viable and successful , even if in reality dominates the isolation . &quot;
&quot; superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists are ex@@ trin@@ sic value ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that works out much more deeply . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not purchase . &quot;
the beauty of Friends was that this focus on the head has been put on .
&quot; each character was defined not by his lab@@ ours , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , Mom@@ quarters in football and the longing of Ros@@ s to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can relate to each other , even though they often res@@ train their feelings . &quot;
&quot; like an employee of the telephone care , I explained to me : ... &quot; my requests for people who feel depressed and confident , can really clearly show me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
&quot; the men who contact us , often feel unable to speak with friends . &quot;
&quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; I get com@@ m with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as is the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one talks about problems openly . &quot;
&quot; Friends is one of the shows , which comes to me in mind when I try to offer long @-@ term reconstruction mechanisms . &quot;
and it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status on the phone to the people in eye @-@ looking the despair may also help increase the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
&quot; and so , if you are visiting Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest when you plan to celebrate the day completely newly designed setting , why do not take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better , if you are sitting in Star@@ bucks someone alone , give him a smile and say hello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the whole 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help P@@ SG in Mal@@ mo@@ ck Malmö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his encounter on Malmö .
&quot; di Maria takes place at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps P@@ SG , to Malmö . &quot;
here is the report and reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held a course as Paris Saint @-@ Germain &apos;s premi@@ er league season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park stadium on Tuesday launched .
&quot; Maria arrived less than four minutes after the launch of his champi@@ ons League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as P@@ SG @-@ Player , who brought the French master to the way , but after that they passed a series of opportunities before reaching a head start when Cav@@ ani continued in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k , also in Group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master , as they are not only striving for the K.@@ O@@ V laps , but also an improvement on the way to the quarters in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the d@@ ots , it was not a cl@@ an@@ esp@@ iel of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ ni @-@ hi@@ mo@@ vic@@ s adapted chances in front of the gate . he was later released in the game against his hometown team and against the association , with which he started his illustr@@ ator career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win back home or down@@ ward in the Champions League . hence , it &apos;s a good start to win two : 0 and look back to our opponents , even if there are certain things that we have perf@@ ected in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; Blanc . &quot;
&quot; it is a good sign .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we have not scored one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to the Paris team after injury to one of three changes in the Paris team , which decided on the weekend to hold its own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but was first aired by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ inian W@@ aters has been named as the man who took the P@@ SG to the next stage in Europe , and he pointed out why , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis passport , before going to Johan Wil@@ and over beautiful in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; however , someone believed that P@@ SG would have a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malmö , the Celtic in a Play @-@ off proposed to reach this level , stepped in An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national races on the field and was competing with a five @-@ man defense and two deep within the mid@@ field becoming a heavy opponent . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , which went far to Kevin Tr@@ apps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , P@@ SG was sometimes in place , with some mis@@ ha@@ unting and bad deals , not least from the case of o@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was abandoned with no less than five trials alone in the first half of the half and then after the restart of Cav@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he pointed out much more skill when he brought his opponents into the game and it was a pass from the hi@@ po@@ vic , which Di Maria turned into a revol@@ ting , which was guided by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole . &quot;
&quot; the second goal was finally just after the hour brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans had his sixth end of the season , having picked up a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; this was finishing all the thoughts that Malmö was able to return to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could hold the end result low before sub@@ player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was seen a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the trainer from Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , gave later that P@@ SG played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said , &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish league which did not have the same level . &quot;
the qualification plays not sufficient . &quot;
hut in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola turned 2008 to FC Bayern .
world and European Championships X@@ avi takes place since summer 2015 for the al @-@ S@@ add sports club in Qatar
&quot; the FC Bayern was obviously just shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s Super@@ star X@@ avi , who at that time played for the FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times a Spanish champion , three times runner winners , four times champion league champion , two times runner @-@ champion , two times runner @-@ champion , a first time world @-@ list of X@@ avi is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , approximately 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona in the summer and transferred to the al @-@ S@@ add sports club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi now joined that he stood before the arrival of Barcelona before the farewell . &quot;
&quot; they told me , that Bar@@ ça would not want to sell me . &quot;
&quot; Madrid then won everything , we were talking about it . &quot;
and that is also FC Bayern .
&quot; X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; rum@@ our wanted to have me .
&quot; reminder : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Bla@@ zer took over the FC Bayern . &quot;
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi is not reloc@@ ated
but the transition came not into place .
and the differenti@@ ating man today works for the German record master : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has put Gu@@ ardi@@ ola under contract , and I have played a great web@@ O . &quot;
&quot; PE@@ P told me I would not change , that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me . &quot;
&quot; so , he has under@@ gone me . &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would have walked with X@@ avi .
&quot; X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca at the quarter @-@ final of the Champions League against the surrounding Bavaria about the entire distance on the lawn , folded the Red Army ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated at the end the King &apos;s palace . &quot;
Matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in the movie
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ting the af@@ ro@@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she &apos;m not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a result of the Sunday night from HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , considered this the need for alternative prospects , and in relation to some black protagon@@ ists of the selected script of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it with the occupation of the film and not the occupation of the show &quot; , &quot; insured Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; Brown re@@ acted shocked , with dig@@ ni@@ ed un@@ belief and called &quot; hoo ! wow . okay , &quot; as the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian himself . &quot;
&quot; Dam@@ on and Brown had made the production of producer Ben W@@ le@@ ck , and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss about the show fin@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; I would like to ask people to think about it - who will always be the director - as they treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; &quot; said Brown initially . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a wh@@ ith that gets struck by her white pi@@ age . &quot;
&quot; the producer of De@@ ar White People appointed for the Fin@@ alist Leo Angel@@ os and Kr@@ isten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the direction of the film . Dam@@ on answered that their direction &quot; &quot; At the end give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was released - the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni captiv@@ ated his anger on the clip , by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on said on the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO HO@@ T that hur@@ ts it . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et served for over 5,000 retri@@ eves and 4,000 virtu@@ kes since its publication . &quot;
&quot; Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the precise race representation in the media is at the top of the social discussion .
&quot; after the teenage sons were killed in 2014 by a white police officer , the movement of Black lives in the country achieved national action and urged legislation and authorities to command discrimin@@ atory practices against color . &quot;
in February the singer Prince Prince made a landing to the movement during the introduction of nom@@ inees albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; record silent &quot; , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; as books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; more recently , the leader of the movement Black lives Mat@@ ter has published an explanation and in response to the question of the Fox @-@ News @-@ Person@@ en@@ beck , whether the group should be viewed as a hatred . &quot;
&quot; the network Black lives Mat@@ ter is a love @-@ group , &quot; said the leader . &quot;
&quot; recently , I announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ees , producers and media views , who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
&quot; whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope , it is unknown . &quot;
&apos; American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; cro@@ wned first champion
&quot; professional sport @-@ clim@@ bers and controls : Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athle@@ te , who won the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; the competition show , which completed just their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participants that could complete all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the seasonal work there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final . &quot;
&quot; at the last task , the climbing was to a 75 feet long climbing time in 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; Brit@@ ten ended the task within the time with which he completed the first athle@@ te , who ended the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge full three seconds quicker , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news following the hard @-@ fought victory , still under shock over winning the Great Prize of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it is amazing to think about it , I have never earned over 10,000 $ or her life , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his pile of money . &quot;
all of a sudden .. as I can not even imagine how that is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the guiding producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood re@@ porter to discuss the finals and why Brit@@ ten , although he was first finished the course , does not receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it receives the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
like very much money a wonderful price is and the life is changed ; he gets the great aci@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll have a res@@ entment against it .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
of these awards he received from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family @-@ father .
he is a hero for his wife and his wife .
&quot; G@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad , Isaac is Isaac . &quot;
&quot; and I think he was just as felt , if they had exchanged the roles . &quot;
&quot; America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or was prolonged for a da@@ ined stag@@ el , the filming will start in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers cre@@ eping on Minnesota T@@ wins &quot;
MIN@@ I W@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit tiger .
&quot; formerly , she once was one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League of Central . &quot;
&quot; the tiger is reduced to her role as sp@@ ic@@ iler , but also played this part on Tuesday to survive the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in a target field . &quot;
the T@@ wins was a chance for Ascension within a game of Houston Ast@@ or for the second American League .
&quot; for Detroit , even if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so difficult to put on over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories take fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad We@@ iss . &quot;
tiger Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon gave his early offensive support to stand up in Detroit three times in the first two inn@@ ings then once in the sixth and then once in the ninth @-@ below .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) suggested 6 times in the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the Bull@@ ring every game , and for that reason I want to enter into the game . &quot;
&quot; the designed tiger @-@ Hitler @-@ Hitler Mart@@ ine@@ z had three takes and was in two R@@ us , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit game played by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits on the Seattle naval base on July 6 . &quot;
&quot; he has well received the drummer , &quot; &quot; says . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at his ( first training ) , looked clearly better off in the bull@@ ring , and he carried it directly into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ uns in the rear of the seventh inner event , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back to the game . &quot;
the B@@ yron Bu@@ x@@ ton set the inning with a double on the left fiel@@ d@@ line .
&quot; Right Fiel@@ ds Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a stand , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ cian for Stri@@ ke@@ out , before it was replaced by the left @-@ handed sla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy passed a wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the design@@ ate ro@@ ok@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who formed a two @-@ run by the Right @-@ handed Dre@@ w ver@@ hagen . &quot;
with a pair of runners and the finishing run in the second place Ver@@ ges the third bas@@ al Tre@@ vor in front of an double play .
it was the major player in the major league in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit an Double Challenge .
&quot; after Detroit added an Insurance Run at the end of the ne@@ ti@@ ring , an R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the status of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the spelling leg remains S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for its fifth position . &quot;
Detroit prof@@ ited to the pr@@ el@@ ude of the game from one yet not movable Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the tiger made three of us achieved in the first two inn@@ ings against the Right @-@ handed @-@ veter@@ an , who had been rep@@ ain@@ ted before the game from the offen@@ se @-@ list , after he was missing for more than a month . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning that I wished for , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt better than I would start and sen@@ sing that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches as in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter in the first place , H@@ uss@@ ler received a single from Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
a Two @-@ out Walk of J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought to Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z &apos;s game to get a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ning in the Scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right , made a further run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , giving the threat . &quot;
the tiger emerged in the second made a one @-@ out Double von Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ ds Anthony G@@ ose for 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he was not really well beaten , but he got the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es found himself in a Pit@@ ch Count , and had no points in the third inning before being replaced by the Rel@@ o@@ ver law@@ suits . &quot;
&quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , it came to three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs . &quot;

hundreds of refugees shall be sub@@ contained in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on their way to Hessen .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the decent people should then be housed in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , like the town of Wiesbaden in the evening evening . &quot;
it assumed about 450 to 750 for refugees .
several sports halls of the h@@ ess@@ ian state capital have been pri@@ med for this event in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can be temporarily destroyed .
it is then to be distributed to other municipalities .

Isch@@ inger : German military intervention in Syria
&quot; the Head of Munich &apos;s safety conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for one possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe that farewell to military action options should not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he drafted the European states &quot; collective breakthrough &quot; .
four years ago she was pleased that the cup of a military participation in Germany has passed .
&quot; now the conflict was da@@ zz@@ ling before our door , &quot; &quot; he said in German . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international aid to the refugees .
Austria controlled its borders on southern and eastern borders
&quot; according to Germany , Austria also introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Minister for Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station OR@@ F , after Hungary , no one will now be returned . &quot;
also in Germany no refugees returned to Austria .
&quot; no , that is so arranged , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; to the question of an agreement , after which Germany could accommodate a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , it has already been a discussion between the General Director of Public Safety and representatives of Germany . &quot;
concrete figures put it not and rejected them on Wednesday at Berlin .
over the past days tens of thousands of refugees arrived over the so @-@ called Bal@@ an@@ route from Hungary to Austria .
your goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann drafted a special summit for next week in cooperation with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
so far the EU states have not yet been able to agree on a joint approach to the crisis .
&quot; the EU &apos;s interior ministers want to take a new attempt on binding targets for a binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees on the coming Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot;
&quot; given the strong refugee status in Germany , the federal government wants to assist countries in the initial inclusion and distribution of men . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will show this together with the countries , called Angela on the late evening evening after almost three @-@ hour consultation with the prime minister in the office of Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ score people , those people who need protection from over@@ came this too . &quot;
&quot; but who did not have a lead @-@ perspective , could not stay in Germany either . &quot;
this view has been expressed in the round quite op@@ tically .
the Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole had to overcome a &quot; enormous effort of force . &quot;
thousands of du@@ bi@@ ased refugees meanwhile are stuck on the route .
&quot; on the night of Tuesday , Hungary had signed its 175 kilometres at the border with Serbia on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; a few hours later , the government announced to Budapest , also the border to Romania with a fence . &quot;
that neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wanted to avoid wing @-@ pan@@ gs in Romania and said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government sentenced the plan immediately .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had car@@ ded the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , meanwhile , many more migrants would like to report on the road to the Greek border . &quot;

no diet fruit - Man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar
Man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
&quot; but who wants to pay attention to his slim line , it will often get lost of them . &quot;
&quot; for man@@ goes , there is relatively much sugar - above all su@@ cro@@ se . &quot;
&quot; healthy are exotic fruits nevertheless : in them stick B vitamins and the vitamins E and C. But above all , man@@ goes , but much vitamin A and its pr@@ el@@ ude beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; who eats the fruits , thus supports visual strength , immune system , and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; in purchase , man@@ go should not be too soft or too firm and to smell . &quot;
&quot; the form@@ work alone does not say anything about it , just as ripe the fruit is - so you can taste green man@@ goes very delicious . &quot;
&quot; these should be stored at room temperature , and consumed in a few days . &quot;
then they taste of course pure or in a sweet food .
a Man@@ go also gives hearty meals a special touch .
it makes the slightly bitter taste of some Bl@@ att@@ sal@@ em like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .

on Wednesday and at night the hair blows partly with storm @-@ strength thanks to its surroundings .
&quot; on Thursday mor@@ nings on Thursday morning we crossed a distinctive wake @-@ up front , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind arches , and a temperature decline . &quot;
how mete@@ or news writes in a communication so Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful south @-@ west circulation .
on the alpine north side the night cras@@ hes through the valleys through the valleys .
&quot; in the episode , the F@@ roh@@ n until Thursday mor@@ nings in the bo@@ oming valleys with bucks from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and specially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the hair dryer can store up to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and to the mountains , and on the mountains are even Or@@ kan@@ frames available at more than 120 km / h . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday , freezing temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees Celsius , moisture then begins to di@@ gest . &quot;
here the rain continues until Thursday night .
&quot; in total , 48 lit@@ res of rain has to be reck@@ oned in the next 48 hours , with some more than 100 lit@@ res of rain per square meter , so after the last few days we already have great rainf@@ all . &quot;

Rome has now a Martin Luther
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of the town President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino on Wednesday , a far @-@ known square in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill , was bapti@@ sed in the name of the German reform@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; after the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he was now honoured as &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is situated in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Col@@ os@@ seum .
the naming was requested by the working community of the evangel@@ ical Ch@@ urches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , priest of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es over centuries as a minority could often only live in secrecy . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic manner , I am visible that the tradition of the Christian faith is welcome in Rome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) stood as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the year at 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city back then as the welcomed fall .
his negative impressions should strengthen him according to historians in his future fight against Rome .
Luther then concluded with his thes@@ es against the Ab@@ las@@ sh@@ an@@ del in the split of the church .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gol@@ ding ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the principal buildings of the Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post has written the introduction and updated the Bible text .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not in the Ot@@ mar &quot; Old Bible , which now appeared with glorious images now . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning was the image for Oth@@ mar Alt , which has formulated his whole personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motives . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has obtained the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which however is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , adapted to the respective subjects , it can be quite glo@@ omy . &quot;
&quot; in the course of about three years , Ot@@ mar has been working on his bi@@ ble project for which he has made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many topics of &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cycles which are related to topics such as cru@@ bil@@ g , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or pat@@ ernity . &quot;
&quot; along with that , he also arose within several partners : that applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological alignment as well as the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his main focus on art books . &quot;
and there is mainly the author Klaus Al@@ te@@ post that has been dealt with on the basis of painting with the Bible scriptures .
&quot; he interpreted the Bible , which has been interpreted by the &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar &quot; &quot; Bible and thus today , into current contexts . &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ ally mirror of al@@ ts painting .
&quot; in between the original Bible and Martin Luther , they are each set in a set of the artist , who here set his own personal thoughts for the particular situation . &quot;
the tin @-@ band has gold containers .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old equally permits a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of intimacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protestant authority . &quot;
&quot; here the education took already time with the tube , &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar &apos;s declared himself . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work up , to possibly also bear witness to the Lord &apos;s father . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to increase art as soon as possible : &quot; the perception of cap@@ acious is characterised by complaints , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is there to be sup@@ pressed .
artists have a different desire and desire to show things .
pictures always have something mystical and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a dinosau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar declared that the viewers come into the pictures &quot; into the images , &quot; they allow themselves to be able to discover , discover and sense the power they have : &quot; the painting seeks to be an anti@@ thesis . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Al@@ te@@ post @-@ and on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; which has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like , as he understands with his pictures life . &quot;
&quot; when I have not taken care of the Bible completely , it is chosen for him important , also mysterious topics . &quot;
&quot; this was not co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; says Al@@ te@@ post : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text writes only . &quot; sprang is a images @-@ Bible . &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to strengthen his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for se@@ ag@@ ul@@ ators both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as responsibility .
part of the original - paper and lin@@ entry pictures - will be presented at an exhibition for the first time in an exhibition which will be inaugurated on November 15th in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Foundation .
construction begin for BM@@ X subway
&quot; plans were made , place found to model Earth &apos;s al@@ char@@ cu@@ le for an excursion : one year later nearly everything was finished - still before the official opening of the BM@@ X track was at the end again . &quot;
&quot; om@@ issions were made in politics and administration by the residents , especially among the residents who do not tolerate the railway . &quot;
&quot; so hill came up , new place sought - now with formal planning and application on building permit . &quot;
the permission to enter in October was the first community member of Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee .
&quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot;
DF@@ B &apos;s commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees to 2019 , the Bundesliga are awarded a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
soccer respon@@ ds to the mounting situation in Germany and secur@@ es its policies in tackling the pending problems .
&quot; I have been doing this for the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification .
&quot; there in principle no one can say , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with that . &quot;
&quot; this must be interesting for each and every individual to get a handle on this issue , &quot; said Deutsche B @-@ chief Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting of Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany . &quot;
&quot; I am the next Wednesday in the reg@@ istrar &apos;s office and meet the Minister of State in Je@@ z@@ ha@@ j@@ u@@ z , and the chan@@ cell@@ or &apos;s chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; since the topic will certainly play a central role , he announced . &quot;
the football could and wants to help .
&quot; however , the pi@@ vot@@ al steps must pursue the policy . &quot;
the German soccer association has therefore expanded his refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; to four years .
&quot; regarding the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us &apos;s Braun foundation , we have ensured that this program runs through 2019 , &quot; stated Ni@@ de@@ bach on the outskirts of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Juli@@ an@@ ko / Malta . &quot;
also some Bundes@@ lig@@ ists support this program .
already this weekend the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ provides a clear sign when they are run on the left of the Tri@@ kot@@ z@@ oles instead of the usual sponsor@@ ing logos ( Her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &quot; We help - # Mo@@ es@@ welcome . &quot;
&quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen Sport@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; picture &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and describes the project as &quot; natur@@ al@@ ness . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee @-@ drama is every one , nobody must see . &quot;

Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung on Thursday ; he will come back to Germany in October and lead to the software group .

&quot; whether it is important to go to the public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said , &quot; everybody can happen . &quot; &quot;

&quot; at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first board@@ game of the European League will finally be destroyed . &quot;
the soccer player will have the Bundesliga to the soccer league in the du@@ el with the FK Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 : 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we cannot rely on him , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ck@@ les on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; if Re@@ us will be back on Sunday of the Bundesliga to Le@@ verk@@ usen , leaving the BV@@ B @-@ Coach : &quot; we expect a return of him to work on Friday . &quot;
&quot; because of the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ ck@@ les will not only change its stem cell position in the Re@@ aper position . &quot;
&quot; so , he announced a change on the back @-@ back position . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Roman Wei@@ den@@ feller takes the place of the chief designer Roman Bür@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he trained on an absolute top @-@ level , &quot; praised the soccer teacher for the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; while jumping into the future is used in all Europe league games , it was supposed to be opened . &quot;
so with a high prob@@ abl@@ ity it will also deny the second game .

Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants the lead role for Germany
&quot; according to the will of the German government , Germany shall be at the forefront of changing the cars of technological progress . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Ministry of Justice decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the Minister of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ ors ( CS@@ U ) , which provides among other things investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ tra@@ dt said on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the A@@ AA , by a &quot; new mobile &quot; new mobile era . &quot; &quot;
&quot; automated , net@@ worked driving will enhance road safety and provide less steel , &quot; said Do@@ ors . &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his counterpart from the G@@ 7 states which also meet on the I@@ AA together with representatives of the industry .
the strategy paper of the ministry of transport emphasises the importance of mobile broad@@ band construction and of high level of high broad@@ casts .
&quot; at the time of testing of new technology , a test road is currently being created on the highway 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; to allow the driver &quot; no additional liability risks arise , &quot; the German federal government wants to examine the legal framework , and , where necessary , to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Germany aims to put up for example internationally for the increased maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km of kilometres . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government also wants to apply as a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only seen people as a driver . &quot;
&quot; automated driving takes over increasingly the car the guide , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that may capture the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , it will be highly automated driving on motor@@ ways up to 2020 technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , we want to expect less cars on public roads &quot; only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; value creation in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location of Germany , the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8,@@ 4 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; the digital connectivity of the P@@ k@@ ws can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD @-@ European Regional Chancellor S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the issue of liability in accidents and the safety of personal data on the driver should be clear . &quot;
&quot; however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still skep@@ tical - much more than a French or American . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday at the AA &apos;s survey carried out by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the testing of DE@@ K@@ RA , the result is that only eight percent of the Germans believe that in 20 years autonomous cars will count in the next ten years , 31 percent do not believe in it at all . &quot;
&quot; in France 21 percent of the respondents said to 20@@ 25 , with autonomous cars , in the USA 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to completely rely on a self @-@ driving vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a survey of the Digital fade @-@ left bit@@ ral , only 7 per cent would agree to devi@@ ate the control during the entire trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway , that could still be 15 percent in flowing traffic , at the St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , everyone would leave the car completely under no circumstances . &quot;
B@@ oll says team - and double start at table @-@ tennis @-@ EM

&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to take the title together without him , &quot; said Bundest@@ ra@@ iner Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ werk during the EM @-@ Course in Düsseldorf . &quot;
this was the time during the flight to a long @-@ term price of sponsor@@ ing in China at this time .
the 34 year old German champion is expected on Friday .

Gau@@ l@@ tier is too old for an En@@ f@@ ant
&quot; it is a mixture of very large fashion show and a guard of watch@@ men . this is the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) , which is presenting an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich on Wednesday . &quot;
the highlights : man@@ nequ@@ ins that look scary thanks to video proj@@ ections .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer that &apos;s among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits into the big star of the fashion - and hence he put men into rub@@ bing .
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant at Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have a white hair . &quot;
&quot; it used to be light , meanwhile it is real &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The S@@ ide@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From 18 September to the cat@@ walk ) , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer has changed at the beginning of the HY@@ PO @-@ Foundation from September 18 . &quot;
&quot; he had actually been to the contrary , because , For me an exhibition sounded a bit to death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when one dies , you get to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously took place in Canada and in Paris station .
&quot; it is about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is a question of tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the work of the man , which has written the fashion history , without ever being a school@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ological is not built up , but she is an excellent chore@@ ographic work @-@ work , for which much effort was operated : to fr@@ actu@@ alize the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was engaged . &quot;
14 tons of material have ent@@ an@@ gled the makers according to information of the curator of Thierry @-@ Maxime L@@ ori@@ ot in Munich .
shortly before the start of the October Revolution it was still a special treat : a lea@@ ther@@ h@@ fit out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he was always interested in strong women ( women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy is to be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , z@@ oned mo@@ dic cor@@ ne@@ ying of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he was dressed for his Ted@@ dy B@@ HS and dresses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; playing a d@@ oll is not allowed to play with a d@@ oll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he made the throw from fashion to himself on their own .
he st@@ acked up f@@ ings and looked at the dra@@ fts of other designers as the Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich told .
but I bought it off course .
for his first own fashion show he did not have to pay the Mod@@ els .
&quot; they got nothing , but they were not allowed to keep the clothes ... &quot;
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze ®
they used to go to the long nit@@ rogen engines in and around Pl@@ ust about to make meters .
the embro@@ i@@ dered substances and peaks have ar@@ isen in great numbers for clients that they re@@ worked for example on blankets and she@@ ers .
&quot; today , that alone does not work any more , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing Director of the Mo@@ g@@ store Pl@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; instead , the mode is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the plann@@ er top , fashion played a larger role , was then pushed aside by the textile industry and is now discovered as niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : top in jewelry , in accessories such as bags and for regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; all the so @-@ called vintage @-@ mode , which re@@ jects in past sticks , an increasing body @-@ potential . &quot;
&quot; who , in the textiles industry in Germany , no longer served , is no longer on the market . &quot;
&quot; with us , they already make up half of the orders . &quot;

only they are allowed to bear the protected label .
roughly 80 percent of sales growth has been cut in the last 15 years .
&quot; trade deals and also the wholesale trade , there are almost no more . &quot;
our products can hardly be achieved by our customers on this path .
&quot; nowadays , the mass ware is manufactured in the Asian region a lot cheaper and almost exclusively distributed over chains . &quot;
&quot; it is also weak@@ ening of export , currently in Russia and the USA . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there are plenty of reasons for new ways . &quot;
&quot; the industry association tries to score also by environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the nit@@ rogen in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; &quot; since this year we lead a seal of quality , which shows that we are producing ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this applies also to the materials used .
diplom@@ at U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berger Mission of the West@@ Sax@@ on University Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embro@@ ider@@ ies and tips .
&quot; in order to prevent competition from the Asian region , we have to find high quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; there is an tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and businesses which have to think , particularly economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design can often only be slightly modified to keep a customer base . &quot;

&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;

&quot; however , according to the Entertainment Weekly , it is not about a new filter , but a kind of continuation that takes place 20 years after the first film with the magic heart girl . &quot;
this is about the experiences of the N@@ anny family with the B@@ anks in times of the global economic crisis in England .

XI urges the economy to open broader to the world
&quot; the economy must open expanding outside to foster growth , said President X@@ i Jin@@ ping at Tuesday of a group called for the steering of the reform . &quot;
&quot; it was necessary to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the centr@@ alist leadership group for deepening an extensive reform . &quot;
&quot; to promote and promote reforms and drive reforms new momentum and vitality , and offer new space for economic growth , said X@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the leadership group has adopted a set of guidelines , including a neg@@ ativity to control market access , complete control of the border controls , the promotion of state operators ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and re@@ conditioning of the citizen @-@ milking . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a neg@@ ativity will be created which identifies the sectors and companies that will not be questioned for investments . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and tested by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of relevance , as it as@@ signs the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , guarantees a legally state operating environment and open the market more open , &quot; the statement explains . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the company and make companies that companies decide how they conduct business .
the statement also stated that China border @-@ areas will allow to explore new models of cross @-@ border business cooperation and explore new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; opening as part of an offer , public controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is made easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit , or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by getting reli@@ eved and facilitate the application process . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee the law of lawyers , to exercise their activities , and to show professional judges and pro@@ secut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;

EU wants to double mer@@ cury in predat@@ ory fish in predat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the threshold values for mer@@ cury in large predat@@ ory fish and allow consumers to add a significantly higher dose to the nervous system .
&quot; consumer organis@@ ers F@@ ood@@ watch , who presents a corresponding working paper of the EU , critici@@ zed the plans : &quot; risks and side @-@ effects of inf@@ alli@@ ons and infants are passed on with full weight on pregnant and infants , &quot; &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t says , the threshold values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , for &quot; economic reasons &quot; from one to two milli@@ gram of mer@@ cury , can be raised by fish . &quot;
large beasts are however already affected so strongly with mer@@ cury that are not allowed to be sold at the basis of the existing limit values about 50 per cent of the length .
&quot; according to dou@@ bling of the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ conceivable . &quot;
&quot; in return for this relaxation , the EU wants to shar@@ k the threshold values in other fish of currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.@@ 1 milli@@ gram of cury per kilo@@ gram . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ood@@ ow acquired this as a &quot; trick , &quot; because small cem@@ eter@@ ies , like e.g. car@@ p usually are so low exposed , that they already have the planned maximum value . &quot;
&quot; the sen@@ ess at Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ del@@ eting maneu@@ ver , which helps alone the economy , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
Mercury is a material which is highly toxic to humans which are highly enri@@ ches over the food chain especially in predat@@ ors .
&quot; therefore , the federal government warns that &quot; already small amounts can cause particularly damage to the nervous damage of the nervous system . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains its website with regard to the valid maximum levels but that a &quot; &quot; health concern for the general population &quot; &quot; should not be expected . &quot;
Mercury is mainly found through coal lighting to the environment .
&quot; according to a written information from the German Federal Ministry of German coal at the Green Party , Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bu@@ ck came up more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the German population of Germany em@@ itted the total . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fishing for instance in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; permanent and thus @-@ region@@ ally exceeded , &quot; the &quot; mirror &quot; in March quoted in the paper . &quot;
