&quot; a ) Z@@ ur effective implementation of the security measures in accordance with this Convention provides the Community of organization in accordance with this Convention Information on core material , the backup measures , and on the characteristics of the equipment , which are responsible for carrying out the security measures regarding this material of Bel@@ ang . &quot;
B ) The organization demands only the minimum level of information and data that is compatible with the implementation of its tasks .
&quot; ( II ) Information on systems are limited to the minimum level , which is subject to security measures relating to core material , which is subject to secure measures according to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in search of the community the organisation is ready , investment data , which respects the community as a particularly vulnerable , in the premises of the community . &quot;
&quot; these data need not be subject to material , unless they remain accessible for further examination by the organization in the premises of the community without further accessible . &quot;
a ) The organization returns the approval of the community and the states to the naming of inspections for the states .
&quot; II ) the community sets either against an proposed naming or at any point against a marked loss , so the organisation of the community and the states proposes one or more alternatives . &quot;
&quot; III ) Whi@@ le due to the repeated ref@@ usal of the community , the naming of inspec@@ tors of the organisation , the Council is referred to as the General Director of the Organization - in the following as &quot; the Direc@@ torate @-@ General &quot; - with the aim of meeting appropriate measure . &quot;
&quot; B ) The Community and the affected States will take the necessary steps to make sure that the inspec@@ tors of the organisation can actually get them in accordance with their Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organization are so established , that i ) are the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and disorder for the community and the states and for the inspection of peaceful nuclear activities as low as possible ; &quot;
II ) the protection of industrial secrets and other inspec@@ tors of the organization to have known confidential information is ensured .
&quot; each State applies to the organization , including its assets , funds and assets , as well as their inspec@@ tors and other officials , the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the rights and liber@@ ations of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization . &quot;
&quot; securing measures after this Convention are termin@@ ated with regard to core material when the community and the organisation have been noted , that it is used for nuclear activity , which is under consideration of the security measures of Bel@@ ang , is no longer usable or practically non @-@ winning . &quot;
&quot; the Community referred to the organisation according to the provision of this Agreement , the transfer of core material from the states , which is subject to security measures according to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; security measures in accordance with this Convention shall be termin@@ ated with regard to core material as soon as the recipient state , as envisaged in this agreement , has taken over responsibility for this . &quot;
&quot; the organization leads documents , from which any transmission and if necessary , the re @-@ application of the secure measures to the continued core material goes . &quot;
&quot; should core material , backup measures have been subject to this agreement , in non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the production of allo@@ ys or ceramics , so that the community should be termin@@ ated with the organization of such use of material , under which circumstances the security measures should be termin@@ ated according to this material . &quot;
II ) that the procedure is used during the duration of non @-@ proliferation of securing measures after this Convention is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons .
&quot; B ) The organization and the community meet a provision largely , that the backup measures planned in this Convention can only be applied as long as the core material used in such an activity . &quot;
&quot; in the regulation , as far as possible , how long and under what circumstances these secure measures will not be applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the backup measures will be applied once again as soon as the core material is again attributed to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organisation is set out over the overall quantity , and the composition of this material in the country or the respective states , and on such transmission of such material out of this state or States . &quot;
&quot; this explains its consent as quickly as possible ; it extends only on matters such as other time @-@ consuming and proced@@ ural regulations and agreements for reporting , but does not include an endor@@ sement , or an inter @-@ secret knowledge of military activity and does not refer to the use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the States bear the costs involved in each of them in carrying out their respective commitments arising from this Convention . &quot;
&quot; arise from the community , the states or persons who are subject to their territory , however , extraordinary costs as a result of a particular desire of organization , thus reimbur@@ se the organization of these costs , provided that they are explained in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organization carries the costs of all additional measurements and sampling which are required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the states make sure that the liability of liability for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , can be used in accordance with their laws and other provisions for the purpose of implementing this convention in the same way as to the nation@@ als of the states . &quot;
any claim that claims the community or a state to the organization or the organization towards the community or a state because of damages arising from a nuclear incident - claims arising from implementing the security measures in accordance with international law is regulated in accordance with international law .
&quot; if the Council asks for verification of the executive provided by the General Director , the Council has not been able to det@@ ach himself by re @-@ examination , that no core material which has to be imposed after this Agreement , he can report the reports specified in Article XII paragraph C of the Stat@@ utes and if necessary for the other actions there . &quot;
&quot; these steps have taken into account the Council , in which mass by the applied security measures , has been attained , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two contractual partners is concerned - every acceptable opportunity to give the Council the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; looking for the organisation , community or state you will find consultations on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this convention . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States are entitled to search for that questions , which arise from the interpretation or application of this convention , will be checked by the Council . &quot;
the council invites the community and the affected state to participate in discussing such questions by the Council .
&quot; with the exception of any disputes arising from the Council after Article 19 or one by the Council , there are disputes arising out of the interpretation or application of this Convention , which is not included in the negotiation or by another of the organization , the community and the states of a refer@@ ral tribunal which consists of five arbit@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States appoint two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also en@@ umer@@ ate two arbitr@@ ator , and the four so named arbit@@ ers elect a fifth one who presi@@ des . &quot;
&quot; if the community and the states or the organization are three days after the request for an arbitr@@ ator , not two arbitr@@ ator , the community or organisation may seek the president of the International Court of Justice , to appoint these arbitr@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; the same procedure is applicable , if binary three days after the name or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator of the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been chosen . &quot;
&quot; a majority of the members of the arbitration report is lu@@ ci@@ ble , and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the decisions of the arbitration proceedings are binding for the organization , the community and the affected States . &quot;
&quot; ( a ) This agreement enters into force for non @-@ discrimination , the contracting party of the contract and members of the community are listed , in force , i ) if the relevant state of organisation are listed , that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; II ) if the community of the organization is listed , it is able to apply their backup measures in relation to this state for the purposes of this convention . &quot;
a ) The organization , the community and the states consult each other on request one of the contract parties on a change of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the approval of the organization , the community and the States . &quot;
C ) The Direc@@ torate @-@ General shall be instruc@@ ted all Member States of the Organization for any amendment to this Convention .

&quot; the &quot; &quot; conventions used in this agreement &quot; &quot; means the agreement and the protocol . &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures when carrying out the provisions of the section I about security measures as required .
&quot; the objective of the procedure specified in this Convention is the timely discovery of the waste collection of peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nucleus of nuclear weapons for un@@ familiar purposes , as well as the deter@@ rent of such a down@@ turn through the risk of premature discovery . &quot;
&quot; to verify the target set in Article 28 , the material book@@ keeping is used as a backup measure of basic importance , ban@@ ces with the spatial de@@ mar@@ cation and observation as an important supple@@ mental measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical conclusion of the veri@@ fications by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which for any type of material tank , which is listed for a certain period of time , under stating the accuracy of accuracy . &quot;
the organization according to Article 3 full use of the safety system of the Community will be implemented .
the control and control system of the community for core material in accordance with this Convention is based on an outline in material balance zones .
&quot; when applying their backup measures , the community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following type , as far as required , as far as they are determined more closely and practical : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of preserv@@ atives , vers@@ ed , lost , lost or in other way from the stock of remote material and the inventory ; &quot;
&quot; ( B ) evaluating the re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of the measurements , and the assessment of data security ; &quot;
( C ) Proc@@ ed@@ ure for determination and evaluation of differences in the measurements of the sender and recipient ;
e ) Proc@@ ed@@ ure for the evaluation of accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;

the special account will be seper@@ ated and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are as follows : a ) The payment is carried out in the form of cash or un@@ paid notes of the Member State , which are payable in the currency of the respective State on order of the organization as administr@@ ate of the legal account and at the but@@ ing of the organization in the country concerned . &quot;
&quot; ( B ) The payment is carried out in two rates , namely i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution will be cancelled within 30 days of the agreement or another between the EEC and the administr@@ ating time ; &quot;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the credit amount to the 1 . January 1979 or another time , the deadlines required between the EEC and the administration , taking into account the deadline for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) Every@@ one member state cannot do payments from above @-@ mentioned appointments on request .
&quot; according to the usual procedure of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker takes about the usual procedure of the organization to cover the cash or the borro@@ wing to cover the expenditure on the special application and to equi@@ p the special account in an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; in the granting of this loan , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC : &quot;
III ) the extent that international economic factors have contributed to the current and fores@@ ee@@ able economic problems of the country ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further credit capacity to Dar@@ rest conditions without har@@ ming ; and
&quot; VII ) , in which the problems of the countries concerned are to be governed by contributions from other sources . &quot;
&quot; any special purpose of special benefits serves the financing of a clearly identifiable and rapid development programme or hab@@ itation ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , which is considered to be approved and administr@@ ated according to the proceedings and practices , which is approved and administr@@ ated by letter ( letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the Sonder@@ tos may not be used instead of a decent means of the International Bank for Re@@ construction and Development ( Bank ) or organisation , which has been approved by the directors of the Bank or organisation that have been approved by the directors of the Bank or organisation . &quot;
&quot; apart from Section 4 Special editorial loan subject to the same pay@@ load conditions , which apply to the organization granted by the organization ; they are thus refundable at ten free @-@ years in the age of 50 years . &quot;
special advantages may be granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies .
amounts for the payment of this clock are directly connected to the organization that it reserves .
&quot; any special deadline is issued by a separate Dar@@ rest agreement between the recipient and the administrator , in which particular the origin of the means is given . &quot;
&quot; the revenue from any special deadline may be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient or for goods or services , which are produced ( ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization , and those who granted the car@@ et@@ aker at the time of the loan granted , shall be the recipient of a special purpose . &quot;
&quot; capital payments from special actions are issued on the special account , and the amount paid by the member states in the currency of a member state shall return to the Member State after its receipt as soon as possible . &quot;
the car@@ et@@ aker teaches up to the complete award of all special editorial loan the EEC relating to the directors in preparation and of the directors approved for the directors and programs .
&quot; during the time of withdrawal of the special editorial loan , the administrator has taught the EEC quarterly on the development of the special acquisition and the expenses made for this . &quot;
&quot; the administrator is transferred to the EEC as soon as possible after the completion of the financial year of the organization , an extensive accounting account of the Organisation for the Organisation on this statement . &quot;
&quot; after full payment of the special deadline , the administrator of the EEC transmitted as soon as possible a detailed report on the project financing and programmes . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker created and performs suitable records and billing , from which the contributions to the special account , which received from the accounts recei@@ pts , and out of the account paid amounts and the withdraw@@ als agreed to the Member States . &quot;
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ akers are working closely to achieve the goals of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ akers see up to the full issue of the special editorial account of time to time information about the state of the special editorial account , the advancement of the promotion @-@ financed programs or projects and on any other questions that affect the provisions of this agreement . &quot;

resolution of the 8 May 1979 resolution regarding the inclusion of the protocol on the import of objects of objects , scientific or cultural value ( 79 / 50@@ 5 / EEC ) &quot;
&quot; recognizing reasons : the agreements on the UNESCO initiative focused on the import@@ ation of objects of objects , scientific or cultural character - the so @-@ called agreement of books , publications and objects of educational , scientific or cultural character . it provides for this purpose among other things that Z@@ ölle will not be charged on the import of these goods . &quot;
&quot; at the 19th session of the UNESCO Conference of the UNESCO of 26 November 1976 , a protocol on the treaty of Florence was adopted to grant customs clearance for a number of objects that have been excluded as a supplement to the agreement , as one of this agreement is considered to be a separate agreement . &quot;
&quot; subject to the application of the protocol agreed by number 16 letter a ) , the rules of the protocol agree with the goals of the European Economic Community . therefore , this protocol is recommended by con@@ ges@@ tion of the statements available in number 16 letter a ) . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The protocol of 26 November 1976 on the agreement on the import of objects , scientific or cultural character is approved in the name of the European Economic Community . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) In the signing of the protocol , the community - through the parts II and IV is not tied , &quot;

resolution of the Council of 24 June 1982 at the conclusion of the Convention on the conservation of the migr@@ atory species of animals ( 82 / 4@@ 61 / EEC )
&quot; considering the reasons : with the Declaration of 22 November 1973 ( 3 ) an action programme of the European Communities has been completed for environmental protection , which has been completed with the resolution of 17 May 1977 ( 4 ) , improving quality of life and protection of the natural environment . &quot;
he participated in negotiations on the conclusion of the Convention on the conservation of the migr@@ atory species of animals .
&quot; the conclusion of the Convention by the Community is necessary so that they can with@@ stand and close the regional agreements in this Convention , as far as these agreements will fall under Directive 79 / 4@@ 09 / EEC into the Exclu@@ sive jurisdiction of the Community . &quot;
the conclusion of the convention by the community brings - a light @-@ light of the legal record that later leaves it - no extension of the exclusive jurisdiction of the community with itself .
&quot; because of the special situation of Greenland , with regard to the natural circumstances of the country and the living conditions of the local population , Greenland should be exempt from the scope of scope of the Convention . &quot;
the Convention on the conservation of wild animals is approved in the name of the European Economic Community .
&quot; the President of the Council adop@@ ts the certificate concerning the affili@@ ation according to Article XVII of the Convention for the territories , where the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , with the exception of Greenland . &quot;
&quot; knowing that wild animals in its many manifestations constitute an irre@@ plac@@ eable part of the natural system of the earth , and must be preserved for the benefit of humanity ; &quot;
&quot; in consciousness that each human generation manages the nature of the Earth for the coming generations and is obliged to ensure that this legacy is maintained and there , where it is used for use in a careful way ; &quot;
&quot; con@@ den@@ k of the ever greater value of wild animals from environment @-@ related , ecological , genetic , scientific , self @-@ based , cultural , educ@@ ative , social and economic point of view ; &quot;
&quot; in particular concern for those types of wild animals , the walks on national immigration limits or outside the same company ; &quot;
&quot; knowing that the states are the prot@@ ector of the migrant species , who have to live in their national jurisdiction or cross it ; &quot;
&quot; convinced that sustain@@ ing as well as effective H@@ EGE and use emigr@@ ating animal species common measures of all states require , within their national jurisdiction , these kinds will have a part of their li@@ fec@@ ycle . &quot;

&quot; the re@@ agents used for the blood group can contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective share , the others are the necessary means to enhance the effectiveness and conservation of the stability of the re@@ agents . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided according to the origin of their effective contribution in three groups . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents contain human origin exclusively by human origin , or that animal or vegetable re@@ agents contain no substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; on each single container is a black on white printed label in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;
