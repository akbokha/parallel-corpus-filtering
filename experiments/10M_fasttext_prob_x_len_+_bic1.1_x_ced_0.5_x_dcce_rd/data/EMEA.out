&quot; this document is a summary of the European Public Health Organisation ( EP@@ AR ) , in which explains how the committee assessed for human medicine ( CH@@ MP ) , in order to get recommendations regarding the application of the drug . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or its treatment , please read the packages ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you want more information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets ( tablets that can dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to inhal@@ ing ( 1 mg / ml ) and as inj@@ ector resolution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. in@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing of things that are not present ) , distr@@ ust , and madness ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental illness , in which the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal vo@@ icing ) alternat@@ ely with periods of normal mood . &quot;
&quot; A@@ bili@@ fy will be applied to the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes , and for the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past . &quot;
the injection solution is applied to fast control of gest@@ ational unrest or behavi@@ oral disorders if the oral intake of the medication is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases the solution can be applied to one or the melting pot in patients , which are the lo@@ ops of tablets difficulties . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are simultaneously taking other medicines , which are like as@@ bili@@ fy , the dose should be adjusted from A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells among each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably seems as a &quot; partial Ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ in ( also ser@@ otonin ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ in and dop@@ amine , but in lower dimensions than the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter acts to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; da dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ in at schizophrenia and bi@@ polar disorder a role helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and prevents their re@@ act . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of bili@@ fy , the re@@ plac@@ ements of symptoms to prevent , was investigated in three studies of up to one year . &quot;
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders that compared to a placebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was passed over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with semi @-@ operating dol , in another study the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo that have been stabili@@ zed to 160 patients where the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with a@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ector has been compared in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that passed on cre@@ ased unrest with which of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , the change in the symptoms of the patient was examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients dealing with the treatment . &quot;
&quot; the company also led studies through to examine , how the body is absorbed the melting pot and the solution to inhal@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies with injection solution , patients showed that A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms increased anxiety than patients who received a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in applying to the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy is more effective in four of the five short term studies more effective than placebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ bili@@ fy , it also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the re @-@ perform man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy injections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy for inhal@@ ing ( observed from 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ pyram@@ idal disrup@@ tions ( ex@@ propri@@ ety ) , headaches , bl@@ ur@@ red ( ex@@ propri@@ ation ) , saliva , bol@@ dness ( nausea ) , saliva and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nie ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
the EP committee on human phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes have talked to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole to weigh against the risks .
&quot; in addition , the Committee came to the outcome that the advantages of inj@@ ecting solution in the rapid control of gest@@ ures and behavi@@ our@@ al problems in patients with schizophrenia , or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if a oral therapy is not suitable to ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the risks . &quot;
&quot; June 2004 , the European Commission announced the European Commission to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit to the transport of A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union . &quot;
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is for the treatment of moderate to heavy man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients showing mainly man@@ ic episodes and presented their man@@ ic episodes to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independently of meals .
&quot; increased effectiveness in doses about a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schizophrenia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients over 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients , a lower initi@@ ator should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duction is set out of the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and in some cases reported a anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
results of an epidemi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder no elevated risk of risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were compared to other anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ ac disease , con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease , conditions that are used for hyp@@ ot@@ ony pre@@ occupation ( stretching de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood@@ pressur@@ ized and mal@@ ign@@ ant shape ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which was a year or less advanced , there were occasional reports of while treating with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole dy@@ nasty Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ ingrad . &quot;
&quot; if in one with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , patients have to occur signs and symptoms of anti@@ d@@ dy@@ nasty , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient signs signs and symptoms that pointed to a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , have to be rep@@ lic@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used in patients with cr@@ amp@@ cent accidents in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or on states which are associated with caution . &quot;
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psych@@ osis patients associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease had patients infected with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole an increased mortality rate compared to placebo .
&quot; however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed d@@ osing , a significant relationship between the dosage and the speak for undes@@ irable rov@@ as@@ cular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ ac@@ osis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em Com@@ a or death , has been reported in patients who have been treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y . &quot;
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related unwanted events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents to treat patients with direct comparisons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ry , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to a deterioration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; gaining weight gain is generally known by schizophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , applying anti@@ psych@@ otic agents in which weight gain is known as side effect , or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central medicines with over@@ bearing side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the resistance rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , however this effect is considered clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study involving healthy pro@@ ban@@ den increased a high @-@ effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) , the Au@@ c of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole to 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to have other highly effective in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ etine and par@@ ox@@ etine , similar effects , and therefore similar tin @-@ reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; at C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; &quot; poor &quot; &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans can result in higher plasma concentrations of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations as compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sible Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; if you consider the common gift from K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefits should weigh the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , should have similar effects , and therefore similar tin @-@ reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after putting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , the dosage of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be lifted to the tin levels before the beginning of the companion therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical studies cans of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day had no significant effect on the met@@ al@@ abol@@ ism of sub@@ str@@ ates by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl@@ an / 3 @-@ method morph@@ ine @-@ rati@@ o ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ z@@ eb@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should get lost to notify your doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; due to the insufficient data base for human security and due to the concerns of animal studies , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefit is clearly the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , also with other anti@@ psych@@ otic medication , the patients should be warned of dangerous machines , including strength vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on it . &quot;
the following side effects appear more frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side @-@ side effects is defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
schizophrenia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole - a total of lower incidence ( 25@@ ,@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ wand , d@@ yst@@ ony and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ ingrad , compared to patients who were treated with semi @-@ operating dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
a placebo @-@ controlled study period over 26 weeks was the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients , which were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3.5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3,@@ 3 % in patients under semi @-@ operating dol treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term recovery period over 26 weeks with a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated placebo .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters appeared , revealed no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; height of CP@@ K ( Kre@@ atin @-@ Ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , have been observed at 3.5 % of patients treated by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to 2.@@ 0 % of the patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; to the side @-@ effects associated with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , and above their appearance also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome , sp@@ ig@@ u@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies and since the launch of the market launch , un@@ intended or inten@@ tional crossing with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone have been observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot;
&quot; although there are no information on the effectiveness of a here@@ tic in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ ophi@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose of benefits since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma connection . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schizophrenia and bi@@ polar disorder on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors will be conve@@ yed .
Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 recep@@ tor and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recep@@ tor and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recep@@ tor to the ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ep@@ in@@ ep@@ in@@ ine and to hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recep@@ tor .
in the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole in doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks to healthy pros showed a dos@@ ages of 11@@ C rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D@@ 2 / D@@ 3 recep@@ tor lig@@ ands , at the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the coup . &quot;
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1.@@ 2@@ 28 schizophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to placebo a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
&quot; in a semi @-@ operating dol @-@ controlled trial was 52 % of the Respon@@ ses patients who were talking to study media , in both groups similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ di@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from Mess@@ ages , which were defined as secondary study destinations , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - Ac@@ sion rates , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at semi @-@ operating dol . &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks to stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schizophrenia showed a significantly higher reduction in the return rate that was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole group and at 57 % below placebo .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ ks@@ in controlled , multinational twin @-@ blind study involving schizophrenia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients were involved and in which the primary study of &apos; weight increases &apos; , stood under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( N = 18 or 13 % of all @-@ value patients ) at significantly less patients ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg in an average weight of ca . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole a compared to placebo over 3 weeks compared to placebo .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed d@@ osing with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ eb@@ ol compared to placebo no superior effectiveness .
&quot; in two Plac@@ ebo@@ x and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies about 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo @-@ effect compared with placebo or semi @-@ operating dol in week 12 . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also pointed out a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ie on such as lithium or semi @-@ operating dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which partly over 2 weeks did not reflect on Li@@ thi@@ um@@ - or Val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic applications , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol resulted in reducing Lyme disease symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of over 26 weeks , followed by a long@@ time enlargement phase for 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients , who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zing phase prior to placebo in regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , predominantly in preventing a relap@@ se in the man@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; based on vit@@ ro @-@ studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for stretching and hydro@@ xy@@ lo@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ries is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the middle elimination time is up to approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with intensive Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and about 14@@ 6 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; at Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in the phar@@ yn@@ ge@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy proportions , as well as a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic investigation of schizophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a special @-@ specific evaluation to the phar@@ yn@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics yiel@@ ded no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the phar@@ yn@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ o Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole were similar to patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy subjects .
&quot; a single dose study involving subjects with different eng@@ radi@@ al liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of liver function on the phar@@ yn@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ o Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which is not enough to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on the security of security , toxicity in repeated gift , re@@ produc@@ tion@@ alism , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and for can@@ cer@@ ous potential , the pre@@ clinical data provided no special dangers for man . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological effects have only been observed with doses or extern@@ als , which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans so that they have limited , limited , or no meaning for clinical use . &quot;
the effects embr@@ aced a dose @-@ dependent co@@ ar@@ enal gland ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment ) and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ rin@@ den @-@ car@@ cin@@ oma ( Au@@ c ) at the recommended maximum dose @-@ lung cancer ( Au@@ c ) at the recommended maximum dose @-@ state @-@ car@@ cin@@ oma ( Au@@ c ) at the recommended maximum dose ( Au@@ c ) at the recommended maximum dose for humans ) .
&quot; furthermore , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the reduction of sul@@ ph@@ ate @-@ con@@ ju@@ g@@ ade of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle from monkey to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations of the human G@@ alle with the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found concentrations of sul@@ ph@@ ate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ lo@@ z@@ ole were no more than 6 % of the concentrations calculated in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of apes , and lie far under the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vit@@ ro @-@ solving . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which resulted in the positions of the 3@@ - and 11@@ fold of the middle Ste@@ ady @-@ State Au@@ c at the recommended clinical value dose . &quot;

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independently of meals .
patients who have difficulty in the slip of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets can take the melting pot alternatively to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) .

AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injections is applied to fast control of Agi@@ ity and behavi@@ oral disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if an oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole inj@@ ector should be termin@@ ated and started with the oral use of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
to boost the Res@@ or@@ ption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection at the M. del@@ to@@ id or deep in the glut@@ eus @-@ maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) can vary depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the drug or ak@@ ut therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .

there are no studies on the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole injections in patients with Agi@@ le act@@ ness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were different to schizophrenia and man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines , in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole inj@@ ector is considered necessary , the patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or a blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
studies on safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole inj@@ ector are available to patients with alcohol or drug poison@@ ing ( by prescribed or illegal medicines ) .

&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ry , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to a deterioration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; gaining weight gain is generally observed with schizophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder , applying anti@@ psych@@ otic agents in which weight gain is known as side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ an was greater compared to the after all @-@ some gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study , used in a healthy pro@@ ban@@ ish Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) as single @-@ piece in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ mination , and which simultaneously received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular . &quot;

&quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe Agi@@ le act@@ ness , a similar effectiveness in relation to the total population has been observed , but a statistical signature could be determined due to a decreased patient @-@ number . &quot;
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1.@@ 2@@ 28 schizophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) compared to placebo a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .

&quot; the effectiveness of my@@ x@@ ane was studied in a main study , at the 4@@ 60 women attended with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters had received an anth@@ rac@@ er . &quot;
the effect of my@@ x@@ ane ( in all variations or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to the drug by conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs ( given in combination with other drugs to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 associated with my@@ x@@ ane patients to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines . &quot;
&quot; considering only the patients treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there were no difference between pharmaceuticals as time as the deterioration of the disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; against those patients , who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer in terms of these indicators , that my@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el with herbal medicines . &quot;
it may also not be applied in patients who are breastfeeding or before beginning the treatment of low ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ites in the blood .
&quot; the Committee on Human Physi@@ cs ( CH@@ MP ) stated that my@@ x@@ ane in patients , in which the first treatment was no longer strikes , more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines and that it does not have to be given to other medicines to reduce side effects . &quot;
&quot; January 2008 , the European Commission promoted the company Bio@@ Science Limited for approval for the transport of my@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;

• Cl@@ auses brochures • a summary of the characteristics of the drug by means of technical information ) lab@@ eling and packages . • The clear picture depic@@ tion of the correct application of the product @-@ looking cooling boxes for the transport through the patient .
&quot; this means that abor@@ tions are similar to a biological medicine , which has already been approved in the European Union ( EU ) and it contains the same substance ( also &quot; &quot; reference phy@@ tom@@ bst@@ ones &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood value , in which in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur if before the procedure is not possible to expect a blood @-@ blood loss and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot;
&quot; treatment with se@@ amed has to be initiated under the supervision of a physician , which has experience in the treatment of patients with disease , for which the medicine is shown . &quot;
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a personal bleeding , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein . &quot;
the injection may also be made by the patient or his supervis@@ ors if they have received adequate instructions .
&quot; patients with chronic kidney failure or patients who receive chemotherapy should always be recommended in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ ite , adults or between 9,@@ 5 and 11 g / d@@ l in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients are to be insp@@ ected prior to the treatment , to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who receive chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems may be a an@@ emia caused by a er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ deficiency or thereby , that the body does not sufficiently address the body &apos;s body thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used to increase operations in order to increase the number of red blood cells , thereby reducing the consequences of blood loss . &quot;
it is produced from a cell into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
de@@ se@@ amed was compared with administration as inj@@ ecting in a v@@ ein within the framework of a main study with 4@@ 79 patients who suffered from kidney problems caused by kidney problems . compared to kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected for at least eight weeks E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a V@@ ene before they were killed or continue E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the change in the hem@@ ost@@ al bin@@ s between the beginning of the study and the trial period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
&quot; in the study involving patients , which were caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ i@@ glo@@ bin@@ s of patients were killed in the same dimensions as in those patients who continue to maintain E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , patients showed an increase of 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / d@@ l of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / d@@ l . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ effect of de@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which may occasionally lead to symptoms of a encephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , steady head@@ ache and con@@ cre@@ teness . &quot;

&quot; the EP committee on Human Physi@@ cs ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that in accordance with the provisions of the European Union , evidence has been demonstrated that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;

&quot; the treatment should be carried out only in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ B &#93; 10 - 13 g / d@@ l &#91; 6,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency . ( 4 or more units of blood on women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied in front of a large electric orthop@@ edic surgery with adults without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion applications is expected . &quot;

an@@ aes@@ thesia symptoms and conclusions may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical progression and path@@ ology is required by the doctor . &quot;
an increase in the hem@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ s increased by more than 2 g / d@@ l ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , occasionally in a patient , individual hem@@ ost@@ al bin@@ s can be observed above or under the tick glo@@ bin@@ - target concentration . &quot;
&quot; in view of these hem@@ ost@@ bin@@ ational stability should be tried over a similar dosage management , the hem@@ ost@@ al targets of 10 g / d@@ l ( 6.@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / d@@ l ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
if the Hä@@ mo@@ bell is worth more than 2 g / d@@ l ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and if the permanent hem@@ ost@@ al bin@@ o@@ value 12 g / d@@ l ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) exceeds 25 % the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be supervised to be supervised to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is required in the lowest approved dose which is required for control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ aes@@ thesia symptoms .
the present clinical results suggest that patients suffering very low H@@ B value ( &lt; 6 g / d@@ l or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) possibly need higher yields than patients where the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ B &gt; 8 g / d@@ l or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

patients should be supervised to be supervised to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is required in the lowest approved dose which is required for control of the anes@@ thetics of symptoms .
&quot; if after 4 treatment @-@ weeks of the hem@@ ost@@ al bin@@ der , at least 1 g / d@@ l ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tic number increased to the output value , the dose should be kept from 150 to / kg times per week or 450 / kg once a week . &quot;

&quot; patients with slight an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ mat@@ ok@@ r@@ it 33 - 39 % ) , in which the present@@ able en@@ umer@@ ation of ≥ 4 blood con@@ ta@@ ves is required , should be compensated in a dose of 600 g / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks prior to operational intervention . &quot;
&quot; the rail@@ substitution should be started as early as possible - for example , several weeks before the start of the aut@@ ologist blood programme - began to be at the beginning of the se@@ amed therapy of large iron reserves . &quot;
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 g / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa that should be given once weekly by three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgical procedure and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 g / kg should be given at the same 10 consecutive days , on the day of the surgery , as well as 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
alternatively the injection can be given at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis over the hose a fo@@ al needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic cooking solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug through the circulation . &quot;
patients suffering from treatment with any Er@@ y@@ thro@@ ul@@ tin ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive se@@ amed or another Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see Section 4.@@ 4 - Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ open@@ ie ) . &quot;
heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment , inst@@ ant@@ ile Ang@@ ina p@@ ect@@ oris , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ osis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ sch @-@ known thy@@ ism , lien ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are intended for a larger Elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery , the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , esc@@ ort or atro@@ cious disease , peripher@@ al arter@@ ial disease , vas@@ cular disease of the car@@ oti@@ onal or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease ; in patients with recently interven@@ ed heart attack or bru@@ rov@@ as@@ cular event . &quot;

8 For patients with chronic kidney failure should not be exceeded under Section 4.2 of the upper limit of the hem@@ ost@@ al targets .
in clinical studies an increased moral risk and risk of severe cardiovascular events have been observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ese @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given by a here@@ of over 12 g / d@@ l ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical trials have no significant benefit that is attributable to the gift of epo@@ et@@ ins when the hem@@ ost@@ al concentrations above the concentration required for control of anes@@ thetics and the prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions required .
the hem@@ ost@@ al bin@@ an@@ rose should be approximately 1 g / d@@ l ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / d@@ l ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evi@@ denti@@ al cardi@@ ac disease or in@@ suffici@@ ency should not be exceeded by Section 4.2 of the upper limit of the hem@@ ost@@ al targets .
&quot; according to the present knowledge , findings by the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ zed , the progression of kidney failure is not accelerated . &quot;
patients under chemotherapy should be considered for the assessment of the treatment efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and the Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response ( patients who may need to be trans@@ vers@@ ed ) .
if the H@@ B increase is larger than 2 g / d@@ l ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ B value of 13 g / d@@ l ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to minimize the risk of possible anthrop@@ ic occur@@ ren@@ a@@ emia ( see Section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ otherapy disease value between 10 g / d@@ l and 12 g / d@@ l ) .
&quot; the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ids should be based on a benefit of risk assessment , including the specific clinical context , which should also take into account the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are envisaged for a greater elec@@ ective orthop@@ edic surgery , if possible , before beginning the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ therapy was examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
patients who undergo a greater elec@@ tro @-@ orthop@@ edic surgery should have an increased risk of anthrop@@ ic and vas@@ cular diseases which have an increased risk of anthrop@@ ic and vas@@ cular disease .
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with a starting mo@@ ve@@ bell value of &gt; 13 g / d@@ l an increased risk of post @-@ surgical thro@@ b@@ bot@@ ic / vas@@ cular events can exist . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , epo@@ chs has not been proven that they can improve overall survival with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received chemotherapy reg@@ imen , if a hem@@ ost@@ al target con@@ centric of 12 - 14 g / d@@ l ( 7,5 - 8,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was tested . &quot;
&quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa along with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in , should be controlled by the blood levels of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in and the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ ind@@ w@@ osis will be adjusted to the rising ho@@ ok@@ r@@ it . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vit@@ ro investigations , there are no evidence of a interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F with regard to hem@@ atology differentiation or proliferation . &quot;
&quot; over anthrop@@ ic , vas@@ cular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ ac disease , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events ( brain bleeding , coron@@ ary arteries , lung cancer , axi@@ al thro@@ mb@@ osis , hy@@ ne@@ ys@@ ms , pul@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ osis , hy@@ ne@@ ys@@ ms , re@@ tin@@ ic thro@@ mb@@ osis and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys , was reported in patients under er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , so also patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
the most common side @-@ effect during the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dos@@ is@@ tive increase of blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ ton@@ ic .
an increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ vas@@ cular events ( see Section 4.@@ 4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients under treatment with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
independent from the er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood@@ vom@@ iting and vas@@ cular complications .
&quot; genetically modified epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ ined and related to the amino acids and carbohydrates , the endo@@ genous Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of local patients . &quot;
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone markings that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ese and the leu@@ kop@@ o@@ ese is not influenced .

survival and tum@@ ours were examined in five great controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blin@@ ded studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ous Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin patients and the control patient .
&quot; in these studies , patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ous Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients with a an@@ a@@ emia because of various more frequent mal@@ ign@@ ancies con@@ consistent an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality than in controls . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ osis and thus related complications resulting in combination with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ous Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin patients and at controls satisfactory .
&quot; there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ genic events in tum@@ our patients , which are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ous Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative impact on the overall survival can not be excluded . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are addressed to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ous Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tum@@ our patients , who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of transferring a tick bell under 13 g / d@@ l , since too few patients were included with these characteristics in the audi@@ ted data . &quot;
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ provisions after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy subjects and a slightly prolonged half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injections , the ser@@ um mirror of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the ser@@ um levels , which can be reached by intraven@@ ous injections . &quot;
&quot; there is no sorrow : the ser@@ um should remain the same , regardless of whether they will be determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;

&quot; if you suffer from Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ open@@ ie , he will break your therapy with ab@@ rup@@ tions and define how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , abor@@ tion must be given by inj@@ ecting in a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated because of a disease due to a kidney disease . &quot;
&quot; a high hem@@ ost@@ al bin@@ ars the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels , and the mortality could be increased . &quot;
&quot; in case of increased or increasing potassium , your doctor may consider any interruption of the treatment with dra@@ fts , until the cali@@ bre are back in the standard range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer under chronic kidney disease and clin@@ ically an obvious coron@@ ary heart disease , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ ost@@ al levels will not exceed a particular value . &quot;
&quot; according to the present knowledge , knowledge is not accelerated by the treatment of blood@@ shed with chronic kidney failure ( kidney failure ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ zed , the progression of kidney failure is not accelerated . &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and the desired effect should be taken into account for assessing the effectiveness of abor@@ tions .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood @-@ dy@@ e ( hem@@ ost@@ glob@@ in ) and to adjust your subscri@@ bers dose to be as low as possible .
&quot; this risk should be wei@@ ghed against the benefits incurred by the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa @-@ derived benefits very carefully , particularly if you are being obes@@ e ( adi@@ p@@ ously ) or if you have been obes@@ e incidents in the past ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ osis or lung an@@ lie ) . &quot;
&quot; in case you are cancer patient , remember that abor@@ tions are like a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances the tumor can adver@@ sely affect the tumor . &quot;
&quot; if a larger orthop@@ edic surgery is im@@ min@@ ated , before the beginning of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; if your values are too high for red blood @-@ offs ( hem@@ ost@@ glob@@ in ) , you should not receive se@@ amed as an increased risk of blood cl@@ amping after surgery is made . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; if you take Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means for the suppression of the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor will arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
laboratory studies have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F ) are means of building the immune system ( e.g. cancer @-@ chemotherapy or HIV ) .
&quot; depending on how your blood poverty ( an@@ emia ) addresses the treatment , the dose can be adapted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
your doctor will be able to arrange regular blood tests to check the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and doesn &apos;t exceed your hem@@ ost@@ al value a particular value .
&quot; once you are well adjusted , you will receive regular doses of abor@@ tions between 25 and 50 / kg twice weekly , distributed to two equal injections . &quot;
your doctor will be able to arrange regular blood tests to check the success of the treatment and ensure that your hem@@ ost@@ al value does not exceed a particular value .

&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease , which makes the bone br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ opause and in men . &quot;
&quot; it is applied in patients with a high risk of frac@@ ture ( bone breaks ) , including in patients who have recently suffered a couple of trau@@ matic envelope , such as the falling apart ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or inj@@ ecting in a muscle . &quot;
&quot; administration of acet@@ am@@ using or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , the symptoms occur in the three days after in@@ fusion symptoms , such as fever , muscle aches , flu pain and headaches . &quot;
&quot; to treat the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must be prescribed by physicians who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data material was used for Zom@@ eta to evaluate A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; at the first study , nearly 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and it was investigated the number of vert@@ ebr@@ ates and hip stret@@ chers over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; it was examined by the number of frac@@ tures for a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was whether the salary of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in ser@@ um ( an enzyme found ) in the blood back norm@@ alized or by at least 75 % compared to the output value .
in the study involving older women the risk of vert@@ ebr@@ ations were reduced by patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) over a period of three years compared to the patient under placebo .
&quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) , those under placebo , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ tional , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
most side @-@ effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days of in@@ fusion and are less frequent at repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be used in patients who may be sur@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid or other Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other components .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ ates , patients are subject to risk of kidney disease , reactions to the risk of kidney and oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose ( Ab@@ die of bone tissue ) in the ja@@ ws . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides information material for doctors ready to apply A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains information such as the drug , as well as similar material for patients , in which the effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should turn to the doctor . &quot;

&quot; treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and men with an increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip . &quot;
&quot; the patient information package should be provided and the following core message includes : • The pack@@ ets • contra@@ indication of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , of non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • W@@ ann on medical or nursing aid . &quot;
&quot; treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • • post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with an increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended once a year . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip , the administration of in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a will be recommended for two or more weeks after operating supply ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should be prescribed A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a just by doctors who have experience in treating the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
&quot; after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a long run @-@ emission period was observed in patients who addressed the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traumati@@ zing sleeve , an initi@@ al@@ dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 is , is recommended for 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D before the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced by the Gift of acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
patients with kidney disorder ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) For patients with a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min is not recommended as limited clinical experience for these patients .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and Eli@@ mination in older patients are similar to younger patients . &quot;
&quot; children and young people of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and young people under the age of 18 , as data is missing for im@@ purity and effectiveness . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ suffici@@ ency &lt; 35 ml / min ) because for these patient population only limited clinical experiences .
an pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ a@@ emia is before the start of therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a by sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the quick setup of the effect of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure , a temporary hypo@@ gly@@ ph@@ a@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , poor oral hygiene ) should be wei@@ ghed against an application of Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate a dental examination with appropriate pre@@ fix dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental attacks , no data is available , whether the interruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the max@@ im . &quot;
clinical assessment by the prescri@@ bing doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and are based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
&quot; the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced by the Gift of acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of as serious side @-@ effects reported by pre @-@ hoped was increased in patients , the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 % ) ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( P@@ FT , H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fr@@ ac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the overall prevalence of pre @-@ hoped between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.2 % ) and placebo ( 2.@@ 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , undes@@ irable drug effects are listed in Table 1 . &quot;
kidney disorder Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid has been associated with kidney dys@@ functions ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ( measured before the administration ) and the appearance of kidney failure as well as a restricted kidney function were comparable in a clinical study at oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years in comparison between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ ine within 10 days of gift was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to 0.@@ 8 % of the patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the Labor@@ atories , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic cali@@ bre , used below the normal tail range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , at 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies treated patients . &quot;
all patients additionally received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study to post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis in the study on prevention of clinical frac@@ tures following a hip frac@@ tures and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; in the study on avoiding clinical frac@@ tures , the vitamin D mirror have not been rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After the administration of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reports ( 0.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the max@@ im occasionally was , particularly in cancer patients , about oste@@ o@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses ( primary in the max@@ im ) reported the with bis@@ phosph@@ ates , including Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid , treated . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients according to tooth extraction or other dental attacks . &quot;
7 trial with 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients joined oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose in the max@@ il@@ field in one with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and one with placebo @-@ treated patients .
&quot; in the event of an over@@ dose which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , can be achieved by the gift of oral calcium and / or a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium carbonate . &quot;

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients from 75 years and older had a 60 % decreased risk of spinal fluid compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0,@@ 00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , referred to as an abi@@ ding effect over three years , which resulted in an increase of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of low frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a raised the bone density at the lum@@ bar acid , hip and at the dist@@ al radius compared to the placebo @-@ treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;

bone hist@@ ology For 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken from the pelvic floor after the third annual dose of bone mar@@ op@@ sies .
a micro@@ computer@@ ised ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treat patients compared to placebo an increase in the tra@@ cular bone volume and the preservation of the tra@@ vers@@ ular bone architecture .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ ates ( B@@ SAP ) in Ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in Ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ X ) in Ser@@ um were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 24@@ 6 patients in perio@@ dic intervals during the study period .
&quot; the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months , significantly by 30 % compared to the output value and was held at 28 % below the output value up to 36 months . &quot;

B @-@ CT@@ X was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the output value up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D mir@@ rors were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received a initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
the overall approach was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group associated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .

the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment conducted more than 24 months compared with placebo treatment to increase the BM@@ D around 5.@@ 4 % at the total th@@ ig@@ h and around 4.@@ 3 % of the Schen@@ kel@@ h@@ als .
clinical effectiveness in men In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study were random@@ ized 50@@ 8 men and assessed the BM@@ D after 24 months .
the study was not designed to demonstrate a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % with placebo .
in another study in men ( study C@@ Z@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M2@@ 30@@ 8 ) the once annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a compared to the once weekly gift of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate related to the percentage change of Len@@ den@@ dr@@ on BM@@ D after 24 months in comparison to the output value .

11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months was detected in two six months comparison studies .
the combined results have been observed after 6 months a similar acceptance of pain and pain kill@@ fulness in comparison to the output value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as responsible for patients at the end of the six month period as Respon@@ ses ( on the therapy ) could be included in an observ@@ ance phase .
&quot; from the 143 with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and the 107 with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at @-@ treated patients , the therapeutic approach to 141 of the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , compared with 71 the treatment with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ er treated patients will be maintained during an intermediate time period of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; unique and multi @-@ time 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid in 64 patients , the following pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plastic bar quickly took up to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;

&quot; the early phases ( α and β , with the above named ½ - values ) represent the rapid resili@@ ation in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of the adult dose can be found in the urine , while the rest is tied mainly to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the overall body Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains un@@ influenced by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the explosion @-@ time period of 5 to 15 minutes led to the acceptance of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ utri@@ d concentration by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation against Time ) . &quot;
&quot; a dimin@@ ished Clear@@ ance of Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ enzyme systems metabo@@ li@@ zed substances is unlikely because Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid is not metabo@@ li@@ zed by humans and because it is a f@@ aint or no direct and / or irreversible , hydrogen @-@ dependent in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ - &quot;

this results in fact that an easy ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and moderate kidney disorder up to 35 ml / min do not require a dosage adjustment of the Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid .
&quot; because for heavy kidney disorder ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data , are no statements possible for this population . &quot;

&quot; abstract of the EP@@ AR for the public , the present document is a summary of the European Public Safety Agency ( EP@@ AR ) , in which the study has been assessed , in order to get recommendations regarding the application of the drug . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( in particular overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabe@@ tic medicine ) is not applied together with another Di@@ abet@@ es@@ medication ( Du@@ al therapy ) .
&quot; it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which cannot be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ite or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ ph@@ onic nit@@ rogen and insulin can be maintained with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ ph@@ onic nit@@ rogen and insulin should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s body can be improved in better , and the blood sugar mirror decreases , which makes a type 2 diabetes better . &quot;
&quot; at more than 1 400 patients , the efficacy of acet@@ tos in tri@@ plex therapy was examined ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ ph@@ onic har@@ n@@ ite , in addition they received both accounts or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ li@@ fied hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood sugar is reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ plex study , the effect of the additional gift of accounts for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ite showed 0,@@ 94 % , while the additional gift from placebo to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % led . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of accounts and insulin is examined in 28@@ 9 patients , patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in the patients who received additional placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ effects associated with accounts were visual dys@@ functions , infections of the upper air@@ ways ( cold ) , weight gain and hypo@@ an@@ aes@@ thesia ( reduced sensitivity to irritation ) . &quot;
&quot; accounts may not be applied to patients who may possibly be sur@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , still in patients with liver problems , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ ac@@ osis - in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; it has been decided that accounts should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , in which met@@ form@@ in is not shown . &quot;
October 2000 the European Commission agreed to the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited as a permit for marketing accounts in the entire European Union .
&quot; the tablets are white until white , curved , and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the in@@ scription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also shown for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is insufficient to insulin , and for those met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility is un@@ suitable ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; to use Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , so the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are threatened by the presence at least a risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart failure ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , weight gain , or oils , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of in@@ suffici@@ ency , weight gain and oils , if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardi@@ ac Out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients suffering from 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ ular vas@@ cular disease was carried out .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports on cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with increased output liver enz@@ ym@@ atic ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper boundary of the standardization ) or with other signs of liver illness may not be used in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T mirror increases up to 3 times the upper limit of the norm@@ ality , the liver enz@@ ym@@ eric values are to be insp@@ ected once again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that point to a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , torso , appetite , appetite and / or darker har@@ n , the liver enz@@ ym@@ eric values are to be checked . &quot;
the decision whether the patient &apos;s treatment is continued with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be directed to the pre@@ aches of the laboratory parameters of clinical assessment .
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dos@@ is@@ dependent weight gain is proven that can be stir@@ red by fatty deposits , and in some cases it is associated with a hydr@@ ation . &quot;
as a result of a hem@@ ost@@ or she joined the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a low reduction in the middle hem@@ ost@@ al bin@@ s ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ o@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.6 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in comparative controlled studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ ost@@ al bin@@ s by 3 @-@ 4 % and insulin in ( relative reduction of the hem@@ mo@@ ve@@ bin@@ s by 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.@@ 2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin @-@ sensi@@ tivity , patients , the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as or@@ ale branch or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff , or as a branch @-@ combination therapy with insulin , is the risk of dos@@ is@@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the launch of the launch of Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , above an occurrence or deterioration of a diabe@@ tic Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms reported with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the appearance of mac@@ ular o@@ de@@ ms if patients report on distur@@ ban@@ ces of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable oph@@ thal@@ mic declaration should be considered .
&quot; in a summary analysis of messages of unwanted events in terms of bone cre@@ aks from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one . &quot;
&quot; the reduced frac@@ tional incidence amounted to 1.9 questionn@@ aires to the treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , women and 1,@@ 1 questionn@@ aires to women treated with a compar@@ ision drug . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.@@ 0 freight rates per 100 patient years ) with patients who were treated with a compar@@ ision medication . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes to pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is to be dis@@ missed ( see Section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on the investigation of interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on the phar@@ yn@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon , and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
interactions with drugs which are metabo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes is e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ al@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the Au@@ c from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one around the 3 @-@ fold .
simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) resulted in lowering the Au@@ c from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one that dimin@@ ished in pregnancy or increased insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance resistance and thereby dimin@@ ishes the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the federal growth .
&quot; very frequently &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rarely &gt; 1 / 1000 , individual cases : unknown ( out of present data are not estim@@ able ) . &quot;
these lead to a temporary change in tur@@ g@@ or and the brake inde@@ xes of the lens as they also be observed with other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic ingredients .
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ ders came across the three @-@ times of the upper border of the norm@@ ality , frequently referred to as placebo , but rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff . &quot;
&quot; in an Out@@ come study of patients with pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ ular vas@@ cular disease , the frequency of severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency was to 1,6 % higher than under placebo if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one b@@ z@@ w . &quot;
&quot; since the launch of the market was rarely reported about cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , but when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has been used in combination with insulin or in patients with cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency in an@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; there was a summary analysis of messages of unwanted events regarding bone breaks out of random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with compar@@ atively medi@@ al groups . &quot;
&quot; over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing pro@@ active study , frac@@ tures stood at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ) of the patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) with patients who are treated with a compar@@ ision medication . &quot;
&quot; when taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days were no symptoms . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ation Rec@@ re@@ ector Integr@@ ated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ G ( PP@@ AR @-@ G ) ) , which results in the animal model to increased insulin @-@ sensi@@ tivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the Glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver and the peri@@ ph@@ ere glucose de@@ valuation in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study involving pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to examine the time up to the recovery of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the treatment the treatment could be maintained ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.5 % ) by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under GB@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) .
&quot; in a plac@@ e@@ ased study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar has been insufficient in spite of three im@@ on@@ ati@@ ger optim@@ isation phase with insulin , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to the patients who continue to have insulin ; a reduction in insulin , compared to the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one group was observed . &quot;
in clinical trials over a year there was a statisti@@ cally significant decline of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Qu@@ oti@@ ons compared to the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( Mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 weeks out examination of type @-@ 2 @-@ di@@ abe@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical trials , compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ z@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels , as well as neg@@ li@@ gi@@ bly , however clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL levels . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de the total plas@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Cholester@@ ols . &quot;
compared to placebo was found under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not a statisti@@ cally significant increase in the L@@ DL cholesterol levels while under met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de decreased values observed .
in a study over 20 weeks Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and also to the hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ cem@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as the hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ cem@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a cardi@@ ac Out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients were random@@ ized with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ ular vas@@ cular disease in groups , in addition to existing anti @-@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy , either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; according to or@@ aler application Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is rapidly resor@@ bed , whereby the top @-@ concentration on un@@ changing Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on will usually be reached 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to the effectiveness in about the triple the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; Inter@@ actions studies could be proven that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on the phar@@ yn@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon , and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) or lo@@ wers the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; according to or@@ ally application of radio@@ active pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the mark@@ er was found mainly in the waste ( 55 % ) and a lower scale in the har@@ n ( 45 % ) . &quot;
the mean plasma elim@@ inations from un@@ changeable Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is at man 5 @-@ 6 hours and all of the active Met@@ abol@@ ites is at 16 - 23 hours .
&quot; the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its Met@@ abol@@ ites are lower than in patients with reduced kidney function , whereby the cr@@ ats of the oral Clear@@ ance of the parent substance is resem@@ ble . &quot;
&quot; in to@@ xi@@ k@@ ological studies they played in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys , after repeated administration of plasma volume , with here@@ tic , an@@ a@@ emia and rever@@ sible ex@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one that dimin@@ ished in the link@@ age of hyper@@ pl@@ ast@@ emia and increased insulin resistance resistance and thus reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the federal growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) were induced by the rat increased inci@@ dences of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary epitheli@@ um .
in a animal model of the famili@@ al om@@ at@@ ous poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ dal indi@@ ans resulted in an increased frequency of colon@@ ists .
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the in@@ scription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the reduced frac@@ tional incidence amounted to 1.9 questionn@@ aires to the treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , women and 1,@@ 1 questionn@@ aires to women treated with a compar@@ ision drug . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.@@ 0 freight rates per 100 patient years ) with patients who were treated with a compar@@ ision medication . &quot;
in a further study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were examined .
in clinical studies over 1 year a statisti@@ cally significant reduction of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Qu@@ oti@@ ons reported a statisti@@ cally significant reduction of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Qu@@ oti@@ ons compared to the output values .
in a study over 20 weeks Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial absorption as well as the hep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
&quot; although the study was mis@@ l@@ acked the aim of their primary end@@ point , which indicates a combination of the overall sense , non @-@ deadly cor@@ yo@@ car@@ dium , stroke , acute cor@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization and re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arteries , coron@@ ary ar@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization and re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arteries , are linked to the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not cardiovascular long @-@ term risks . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; 45 &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the in@@ scription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of messages of unwanted events regarding bone breaks out of random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind studies have been treated with more than 8.@@ 100 patients who were treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and received more than 7,@@ 400 patients , the compar@@ ision medication , showed itself an increased incidence of bone bro@@ ods in women . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.@@ 0 freight rates per 100 patient years ) with patients who were treated with a compar@@ ision medication . &quot;

Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e is usually used once or twice a day if a quick initial effect is desired with a longer lasting effect .

&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e was not able to produce a total of 2@@ 94 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to utilize the insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ li@@ fied hem@@ ost@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e led to a withdrawal of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c sp@@ eg@@ els that pointed out that the blood sugar levels were similarly strong as with another human experience .
Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e should not be used in patients who may possibly super@@ sensitive ( allergic ) on Human@@ ist ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
&quot; moreover , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e might need to be adjusted , when it is administered together with a number of other drugs , which can affect the blood sugar ( the full list is the pack@@ et to be found ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human Physi@@ cs ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e weigh in the treatment of diabetes against the risks .
October 2002 the European Commission adopted the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit to the event of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e across the European Union .
mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice a day when a quick initial effect is desired with a longer lasting effect .
injection needle must be kept at least 6 seconds long under the skin to ensure that the entire dosage has been inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood sugar have significantly improved , for example , by a more intensive insulin treatment , the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can change symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot;

&quot; Aden@@ ur@@ ic is applied to patients which have already signs signs of cryst@@ all@@ usion , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or poison notes ( &quot; stones , &quot; i.e. greater urine cryst@@ all@@ ments , which can lead to artic@@ ular and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ inary seal are still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ite after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased once a day to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , there may still be offen@@ ding accidents ; therefore , patients will be advised at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic , further medicines to prevention of accidents . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended for children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ tation since it was not examined for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , at the 1 0@@ 72 patients participating , the efficacy of three of different Aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) compared with a placebo ( hypo@@ cr@@ app@@ ents ) and of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( a different medicine to treat hyper@@ ur@@ an@@ emia ) . &quot;
in the second study two doses taken by Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ qui@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of once daily ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients whose ure@@ th@@ rot@@ ors were under 6 mg / d@@ l in the blood during the last three measurements .
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients , the Aden@@ ur@@ ic received a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patient , which once daily intake 120 mg once daily , in the blood of under 6 mg / d@@ l . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular , in patients with cardi@@ ac disease , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects which affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
the Committee on Human Physi@@ cs ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ure@@ th@@ oph@@ es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els in blood but also a higher risk of side @-@ effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
&quot; treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ an@@ emia in diseases , which have already led to Ur@@ at@@ abl@@ is@@ ations ( including one from the medical history ) or currently present Gi@@ cht@@ ing and / or a Gi@@ cht@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ser@@ um , after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , still &gt; 6 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , a dosage increases to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney functionality , the efficacy and safety have not been fully examined ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and teenagers , because in children and young people there are no experiences , the use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate is not recommended in this patient group . &quot;
&quot; in case of transplan@@ tion , the application of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate is not recommended in this patient group ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular diseases For patients with severe cardi@@ ac disease or de@@ compensated cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency is not recommended using F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ so@@ ber medicines , it can occur during the treatment beginning to an acute gyp@@ sum attack , because by lowering the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ sä@@ ulen@@ le , first ur@@ inary tract can be mobili@@ zed in the tissue . &quot;
B . for mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment ( les@@ bian syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases so far increases that it comes to a storage in ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing the clinical trials of phase 3 have been observed light abnorm@@ alities of the liver values associated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate patients ( 3.5 % ) .
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to perform before the start of the F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ treatment and in the further course depending on the clinical assessment of a liver function ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; The@@ ophy@@ l@@ in Z@@ was were not carried out in@@ effective studies on F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate , but it is known that the X@@ O @-@ shirts can lead to a rise in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ atex of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ ll@@ in was also reported for other X@@ O Hem@@ mer . &quot;
&quot; for subjects , the simultaneous gift of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate and Nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure ( C@@ max 28 % , Au@@ c 41 % and T@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
in clinical studies the application of Nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors did not stand in connection with a clin@@ ically significant increase in unwanted events .
&quot; col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in , without a dosage adjustment for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active substance required at the same time . &quot;
&quot; in a study involving subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily , an average 22 % increase in Au@@ c from Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ enzyme on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an an@@ ta@@ zi@@ ms , containing Magn@@ esi@@ um@@ hydro@@ x@@ id and aluminium hydro@@ x@@ id , is delayed by F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and caused a decrease in the C@@ max to 32 % , however no significant change in the Au@@ c . &quot;
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exp@@ oni@@ ated pregn@@ ancies do not leave side effects of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate on pregnancy or the health of fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
&quot; animal studies do not leave directly or indirectly harmful effects on pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful in the taxes of a vehicle , used by machines or in the exercise of dangerous activities until they can be reasonably sure that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not affect their performance . &quot;
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of the cardiovascular events has been observed in the total f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s in the total f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in the figure 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term contrac@@ tion studies ( 1,4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate could be found .
the risk factors in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ ac@@ ulous erotic disorder and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ d@@ inf@@ ant or a de@@ compensated cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency in the patient history .
&quot; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) side effects associated with the medicine and which were reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate treatment groups in total more than once , are listed below . &quot;
diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are at the same time treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In the clinical trials no heavy rash or heavy over@@ sensitive reactions were observed .
7 &quot; long @-@ term delay in the open long @-@ term delay studies were treated 9@@ 06 patients up to 1 year long , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years long , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients with f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the treatment @-@ related events reported during the long @-@ term studies were similar to those reported in the studies of the Phase 3 ( see table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events have been reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups altogether more than once and performed in patients , the F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure period of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patients ) , according to the specifications . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events have either been reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these doses either at all or with a lower frequency :

clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC has been shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ act study as described below ) which were carried out with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ k@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy point was in every study the proportion of patients with which the last three month of certain ser@@ um s@@ laugh@@ tered bar &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 8 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a ser@@ um Cre@@ ate value to study of &gt; 1.5 mg / d@@ l and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superiority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ act study demonstrated the statisti@@ cally significant superiority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional dosage Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with ser@@ um incre@@ mental &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were received for the analysis . * p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus 80 mg &quot;
lowering the ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ sä@@ ulen@@ le on &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed at the doctor &apos;s visit in week 2 and permanently maintained over the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um incre@@ mental rate &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l received 100 mg 1 x daily .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney dys@@ functions The AP@@ EX @-@ study reviewed the effectiveness in 40 patients with kidney dys@@ functions ( d. h .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients achieved . &quot;
&quot; there were no clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to percentage process of ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ aci@@ re@@ con@@ centric , irrespective of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with regular kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ aci@@ re@@ con@@ centric ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of the patients ( Bas@@ eline ) had a ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ aci@@ re@@ con@@ centric of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l .
the data collected in two years of the open extension study of phase 3 showed that the lasting lowering of ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ sä@@ ulen@@ esp@@ ace on &lt; 6 mg / d@@ l ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) showed that less than 3 % of patients needed in the months 16 @-@ 24 a treatment against a poison shoe ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients required no treatment against a poison shoe ) .
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the fangs , which had 54 % of the patients with a complete disappearance of the fangs until month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ IP values ( &gt; 5@@ µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.@@ 0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long@@ time extension studies ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; at healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plasma @-@ con@@ centric time curve ( Au@@ c ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate after administration , simpler and multi@@ pler cans from 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional . &quot;
&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at a rise in Au@@ c , which is greater than the dos@@ is@@ hable increase . &quot;
after taking easier or multi @-@ pler doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3.@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.@@ 0 @-@ 5.@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml .
&quot; however , no clinical significant change has been observed in percentage of ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ mammals , provided that this has been tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady state capacity ( V@@ SS / F ) from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is located in the range of 29 to 75 l after ing@@ esting doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plas@@ h@@ ap@@ rot@@ um from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary bond to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is reached via the concentration of concentration , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vit@@ ro studies on human liver abnorm@@ alities , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 were formed , and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ eh@@ bro@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly created by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , about 49 % of the dose found in urine as un@@ changeable F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , whose well @-@ known oxid@@ ative met@@ al@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine also approximately 45 % of the dose found themselves as un@@ changeable F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ gur@@ on@@ id of the substance ( 1 % ) , whose well @-@ known oxid@@ ative met@@ al@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
special patients with kidney failure After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild to moderate or severe kidney failure changed the C@@ max from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at not in proportion to pro@@ ban@@ den with normal kidney function .
the mean total Au@@ c from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at took about the 1.8 @-@ fold of 7.5 μ k@@ h / ml in group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ k@@ h / ml in group with severe kidney function .
&quot; 12 liver reproduction , After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( chil@@ d Pu@@ gh @-@ Classi@@ fication B ) liver functioning , the C@@ max and Au@@ c von F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate and its Met@@ abol@@ ites changed not significantly compared to pro@@ ban@@ den with normal liver function . &quot;
age There have been no significant changes in terms of the Au@@ c von F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its Met@@ abol@@ ites after taking multiple doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger pro@@ ban@@ den .
&quot; car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ esis , Mut@@ agen@@ ese , impairment of fer@@ til@@ ity With male rats has been found a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary tum@@ ors ( interim cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ oma ) only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin @-@ stones in the highly @-@ treated group , at about the 11 @-@ times of exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ ch@@ ori@@ zation and urine @-@ composition and for clinical use as not relevant .
it has been noted that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day does not have any effect on the fertility and reproduction performance of male and female rats .
&quot; at high doses , which were about the 4,@@ 3@@ - fold of the human therapeutic exposure , maternal toxicity came upon , which went along with a lowering of the performance and a development delay in the descendants of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in tra@@ iling cr@@ acks with ex@@ positions , which bore approximately the 4,@@ 3 @-@ fold and with common rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions that bore approximately the 13 @-@ fold of the human therapeutic exposure , erg@@ ing no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects . &quot;

&quot; since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already separated from each other in drugs used in the European Union , the company submitted data from earlier studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to em@@ ulate the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE in terms of increasing vitamin D mirror .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients were treated with low vitamin D mirror for the patient who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE ( 11 % ) than those who took exclusively Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also put data in front of the data contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE ( contained Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on dose , exactly the dose which is needed for preventing a bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headaches , pain of muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal he@@ ats ( muscles , bone or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdom@@ inal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ans ( flat@@ ness ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( pu@@ zz@@ ling ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( pu@@ ffed abdom@@ en ) , as well as acid . &quot;
&quot; patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components may not be applied AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in diseases of the op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ a@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who can not stand tall or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
Janu@@ ary@@ 2007 gathered the European Commission to Mer@@ ck Sharp &amp; D@@ oh@@ me Ltd . a permit to the marketing of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE in the entire European Union .
&quot; cap @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the tear of a button on one side and &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is only associated with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , beverage or use of medicines ( including An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
following critics are exactly to be followed to reduce the risk of op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and related side effects ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE should be swal@@ lowed after the end of the day with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not cr@@ ush the tablet or tablet in the mouth as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not be taken before the first food intake of the day that should take place 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
&quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic Ul@@ kus , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , except p@@ yl@@ or@@ opla@@ sty , are given only under particular caution ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; eco @-@ related reactions , such as Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Stri@@ c@@ tures , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( partly were these severe and required a hospital instruction ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore point out attention to all signs and symptoms which should point out to possible f@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out to the occurrence of symptoms such as Dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gie , pain , or a backward pain , or to obtain medical advice ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
3 The risk of severe pain @-@ ha@@ ge@@ tic side effects seems to be increased in patients who may not take the medicine correctly and / or after the appearance of symptoms that point to an ös@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is very important that all lec@@ tual references to the patient will be passed and understood by patients ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large clinical studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was determined , rarely ( according to market launch ) ga@@ stri@@ c and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and associated with complications ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy @-@ m@@ ime mostly administered by intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available , the tips will indicate whether the ab@@ stain from a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients who need a jaw surgical procedure , reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose of the jaw . &quot;
clinical evaluation by the prescri@@ bing doctor is relevant to treatment planning at each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted that they should take advantage of the intake of a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE the tablet in the next morning after they noticed their om@@ issions .
&quot; you should not take two tablets on the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the week@@ day planned . &quot;
other diseases that affect the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should be treated before the start of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE .
&quot; Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da and some or@@ ale drug can imp@@ air the Res@@ or@@ ption of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time . &quot;
therefore patients must wait after the intake of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at at least 30 minutes before they take other medications ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; although specific intervention studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken together in clinical studies with a number of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is intended only for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not used either during pregnancy or breastfeeding women .
&quot; animal studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate leave no indication of directly harmful effects in terms of pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose of the jaw was reported in patients under Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ; most reports come from cancer patients but also reported on oste@@ opor@@ os@@ ep@@ ati@@ sts over it .
&quot; nevertheless , depar@@ tures from the Ser@@ um @-@ Cal@@ ci@@ um to &lt; 8,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 2,@@ 0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the ser@@ um - phosph@@ ate to &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 0,@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;

in the two @-@ year extension of these studies the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of the spine and Tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to continue ; also the BM@@ D of the Fem@@ ur@@ hal@@ ses and the entire body was maintained .

in this study the daily gift of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the appearance of at least a new spine by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .

&quot; Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at will not be left out over the sau@@ re or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys , and therefore it is not assumed that people affected the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines through these transport systems . &quot;

&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application of Ad@@ vaginal met with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was compared . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients where the transp@@ l@@ ant was cras@@ hed after a treatment duration of a year ( by examining , for example , a renewed organ transplan@@ tation or a resum@@ ption of the di@@ aly@@ sis was needed ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , recent further studies have been carried out in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and examined as Ad@@ vaginal met in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft . &quot;
&quot; tre@@ mor ( tre@@ mor ) , headaches , nausea / vom@@ iting , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , kidney problems , increased blood sugar levels ( hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ) , diabetes , reproduction calibr@@ ation of blood ( hyper@@ state ) as well as in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) as well as in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components , Ad@@ vag@@ us may not be applied . &quot;
patients and doctors must be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines should be taken simultaneously with Ad@@ vaginal since the Ad@@ vaginal dosage or the dose should be adjusted accordingly appropriately .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t@@ ational patients should make this drug or make changes in immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to transplan@@ ts or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or super@@ immun@@ om@@ od@@ ine . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of the formulation or regime should only be done under the narro@@ wer control of one in the transp@@ l@@ ant ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; following a shift to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dosage adjustment must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains . &quot;
&quot; the dosage of Ad@@ vaginal raf should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ lication and compatibility in the individual case and on blood @-@ level regulations ( see below &quot; &quot; recommendations &quot;
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vaginal , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ ks should be controlled before switching and over two weeks to switch . &quot;
&quot; on day 4 the systemic exposure , measured as a mirror @-@ level , measured with both form@@ ulations both at Ni@@ er@@ - as well as in le@@ ber@@ transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeti@@ tive controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ ks are recommended during the first two weeks after transp@@ l@@ ant under Ad@@ vaginal , to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate after@@ math @-@ phase . &quot;
&quot; da Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , can last a adjustment of the Ad@@ vaginal @-@ Dos@@ is@@ sal@@ as several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the condition of the patient is not allowed in the first post@@ operative phase , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment intraven@@ ously may be introduced ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrations for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; the duration of application Z@@ ur repression of the transplan@@ tion must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy can not be specified . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of Tran@@ splan@@ la@@ xis The or@@ ale Ad@@ vaginal therapy should start with 0,@@ 20 - 0,@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning . &quot;
further tin adap@@ tations may later be necessary as the phar@@ yn@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after the transp@@ l@@ ant .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of Tran@@ splan@@ la@@ xis The or@@ ale Ad@@ vaginal therapy should start with 0,@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendations - switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vaginal , must be converted to a transp@@ l@@ ant receiver of twice daily intake of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules at a time daily intake of Ad@@ vaginal capsules , so this change in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire day dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transp@@ l@@ ant After a shift from other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants to Ad@@ vaginal once a day must start treatment with each other in kidney and liver transp@@ l@@ ant dose for the prophy@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ ts .
&quot; heart transp@@ l@@ ant With adult patients , which are converted to Ad@@ vaginal osis , is an or@@ ale initi@@ al@@ dose of 0,@@ 15 mg / kg / day daily in the morning . &quot;
other transplan@@ tation receiver Ob@@ ject there are no clinical experience with Ad@@ vaginal dose of lung cancer and cancer transplan@@ ted patients arrived in a oral initi@@ atory dose of 0.@@ 2 mg / kg / day and in intestinal trac@@ ell@@ ation dose of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / day for application .
dosage adap@@ tations in special patients groups with reduced liver function Z@@ ur maintenance of blood tal@@ cians in the per@@ missible area may be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions a descent of the dose .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function As the kidney function does not affect the pharmaceutical function of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required . &quot;
&quot; due to the ne@@ phr@@ otic potenti@@ als of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ ine levels , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
conversion of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Ad@@ vaginal , When switching from a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ ous to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; recommendations on the talent level in the full blood , The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ lication and toler@@ ability in the individual case under state aid of full blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ mud controls . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to carry out frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ talents during the first two weeks after transp@@ l@@ ant , followed by periodic@@ ally controls during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also change after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vaginal , Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ ation , changes of immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or at the simultaneous application of substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us full blood@@ stream ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Ad@@ vaginal met a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot;
the data in clinical trials make sure that a successful treatment in most cases is possible if the talent levels in the blood does not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice the talent of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in full blood lie in the first time following liver transp@@ l@@ ations usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and in the heart of 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; during the subsequent income generation of liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac disease , usually blood concentrations were used in the range of 5 to 15 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious unwanted events , including transplan@@ ts or other side effects , which can occur in a result of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of the formulation or regime should only be done under the narro@@ wer control of one in the transp@@ l@@ ant medical device ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; 5 C@@ ur treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ ts , which proved to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants as therapy , are not yet a clinical data for the retar@@ ded formulation ad@@ vag@@ us . &quot;
&quot; for prophy@@ la@@ xis of the transplan@@ tion of adult transplan@@ ators and transplan@@ tations in the child &apos;s age , there are still no clinical data for the retar@@ ded formulation ad@@ vag@@ us . &quot;
&quot; due to possible interactions , which can lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ b levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements containing cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) , or other herbal medicines during treatment with Ad@@ vaginal met ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentrations in the blood is offered as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels in such circumstances can be significant fluctu@@ ations in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f there was a cardi@@ omy@@ tin@@ opathy or Sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ tro@@ phy , which therefore can also occur under Ad@@ vag@@ us . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical distur@@ ban@@ ces are an already existing heart disease , hypertension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infection , fluid exposure and oils . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants , the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted for the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin lesi@@ ons due to suitable clothing or use of a solar protection by means of a high protective factor . &quot;
&quot; when patients discover the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for pris@@ als like head@@ ache , changed consciousness levels , cr@@ amps and visual dys@@ functions should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. &quot;
&quot; since Ad@@ vaginal Hart@@ mut , retar@@ ded , l@@ act@@ ose , is included in patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ t@@ arian Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ intolerance , l@@ act@@ ase inhibit@@ or mal@@ absorption special caution . &quot;
simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies which are known as inhibit@@ or or in@@ duction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may increase the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and consequently increase the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or lower .
&quot; it is therefore recommended that the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels in simultaneous gift of substances , which can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism and adapt the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain equal concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly pronounced interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ k@@ oti@@ ka such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ol , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ol as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic A@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ase ( z ) . &quot;
Phar@@ pr@@ ok@@ ine@@ tik@@ tik@@ os studies have resulted in the increase in blood levels mainly from the increased bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the inhibit@@ ing of gastro@@ intestinal radiation , results . &quot;
&quot; Hoch@@ do@@ si@@ fied Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as is used in acute retri@@ eving actions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood . &quot;
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with drugs which are metabo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 whose metabolism is imp@@ aired .
&quot; da Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us down the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tive , and thus increase hormone exposure , is particularly careful in decisions about receptive measures . &quot;
the results of animals have shown that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can potentially reduce the clearing of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and extend their half @-@ time .
&quot; the results of a small number of investigations in transp@@ l@@ ant patients provide no indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants , an increased risk of unwanted events with regard to the course and earnings of pregnancy exists . &quot;
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of new@@ bor@@ ns refers to any damaging effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ k@@ ali@@ emia of the newborn ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the side @-@ effective profile of immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants can often be determined due to the severe disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other drugs .
&quot; below , the side @-@ effects are listed after their frequency in descending order : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( = 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on the available data is not invaluable ) . &quot;

&quot; infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases How well @-@ known for other highly effective immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants is treated in patients who are treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , proto@@ zo@@ ale ) frequently increased . &quot;
cases of B@@ K @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ Associ@@ ated progressive multi @-@ focal leu@@ ko@@ encephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ pressive therapy including therapy with Ad@@ vaginal therapy .
it was reported via ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant Ne@@ oplas@@ men including EB@@ V@@ - associated @-@ coated diseases and skin tum@@ ours in conjunction with the treatment of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and high bond of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plastic rot@@ ate can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ zed . &quot;
drug mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on molecular level should be conve@@ yed the effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us by its li@@ aison to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ish protein ( F@@ K@@ B@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for the connection of the connection in the cell .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ bili@@ ary inhi@@ bit of signal trans@@ duc@@ tive because of the T @-@ cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sup@@ presses the T @-@ cells and the proliferation of B cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ k@@ inen ( like inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 and G @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; 12 confirmed high performance levels within the first 24 weeks in the Ad@@ vaginal group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) 3@@ 2,@@ 6 % and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) 2@@ 9,@@ 3 % . &quot;

&quot; patients survival rates after 12 months were at 9@@ 6.@@ 9 % for Ad@@ vag@@ us and 9@@ 7.5 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; in the Ad@@ vaginal arm , 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 8 ( 3 women , 5 men ) deaths . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy and safety of Pro@@ gra@@ f , Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in and Ad@@ vaginal has been compared , each in combination with Basi@@ li@@ xi@@ mab antibody therapeu@@ tics , MM@@ F and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , at 6@@ 38 de Nov@@ o kidney transplan@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of therapy sessions after 12 months ( defined as death , transplan@@ ted loss , bi@@ op@@ sy res@@ ignation or missing Fol@@ low @-@ up@@ - data ) was 14.@@ 0 % in the Ad@@ vaginal group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) and 17,@@ 0 % in the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) . &quot;
the treatment differential was -@@ 3.@@ 0 % ( Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f@@ - Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 9@@ 5.2 % con@@ fi@@ den@@ um interval &#91; -@@ 9.@@ 9 % , 4.@@ 0 % &#93; ) for Ad@@ vaginal interval &#91; -@@ 8.@@ 9 % , 5.2 % &#93; ) for Pro@@ gra@@ f vs Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;

&quot; 175 Integr@@ ated patients , at 4@@ 75 patients who had subjected to a pancre@@ atic planning process and used in 6@@ 30 cases following a intestinal transp@@ l@@ ant as primary immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive . &quot;
&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies spoke the observations in the large studies in which pro@@ gra@@ f is applied to liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac disease . &quot;
l@@ atives transplan@@ tation In an interim analysis about a recent run @-@ run multi @-@ centric study involving oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was reported on 110 patients working within 1 : 1 @-@ Rand@@ om@@ isation either Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
&quot; also a chronic transplan@@ tion , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome , was less common in the first year after the transp@@ l@@ ant ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the survival rate after a year was 80@@ ,@@ 8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - and 83 % in the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) . &quot;
in the patients with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us patients it came to the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis O@@ bl@@ iter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % below Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.@@ 0@@ 25 ) .
&quot; the number of cases , in which of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us had to be converted ( n = 13 ) , was significantly larger ( p = 0,@@ 02 ) than the number of patients being surrounded by Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in 1995 ; , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which no acute transplan@@ tion came , was greater after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5,@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.2 % ) and after 1 year ( 50@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Tran@@ spl@@ ant 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a study , the incidence of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ al was significantly lower in the patients with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us patients . &quot;
pancre@@ atic planning is a multi@@ centric study conducted at 205 patients who received simultaneously a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ tation which received after a random@@ ised method of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the or@@ ale initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0.@@ 2 mg / kg / day and was followed after reaching the per@@ v@@ ented valley levels from 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
&quot; gut micro@@ graf@@ ting The published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study conducted by 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ine , 75 liver and intest@@ ine and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ cer@@ al transp@@ l@@ ations ) under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and pre@@ d@@ nis@@ on a current survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;

&quot; factors such as a low hem@@ at@@ rate and low protein concentrations , lead to an increase in the in@@ found fraction of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or to be responsible for treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids in favor of transp@@ l@@ ant monitoring higher clearing @-@ rats . &quot;
&quot; this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely metabolic in front of the ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly via the genes . &quot;
&quot; in stable patients , made by Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) on Ad@@ vaginal ( once daily ) on Ad@@ vaginal dosage , the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Ad@@ vaginal had nearly 10 % lower than under pro@@ gra@@ f . &quot;

Adv@@ ate is used to treat and preventing bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII conditioned , inn@@ ate blood cl@@ apping disorder ) . &quot;
&quot; the dosage and frequency of application are directed after , whether they are applied to the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII lack , which causes bleeding problems like bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but according to a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII .
&quot; Adv@@ ate is a different in the European Union approved medicines called Re@@ lie@@ ate , similar , but it is different , so that the medicine contains no proteins and animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , among them a study of 53 children under six years , the application of the drug is investigated using the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of Adv@@ ate was evaluated in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood@@ sep@@ iso@@ den with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ xy ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who may be sur@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human ger@@ inn@@ ate factor VIII , Maus@@ - or Ham@@ ster@@ protein or any of the other components . &quot;
March 2004 the European Commission adopted by the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit to the transfer of lawyers across the European Union .
&quot; dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy set up after the severity of the factor VIII , according to the site and the extent of the blood and the clinical state of the patient . &quot;
&quot; in the following here@@ mor@@ atorium events , the factor VIII factor should not be decreased in the appropriate plastic bar ( in % of the standard or in a / d@@ l ) . &quot;
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours for patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute draw@@ backs are eliminated .
inj@@ ecting all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours for patients under 6 years ) until the danger of the patient is over .
&quot; during the treatment , the controlling of the dose and the frequency of inj@@ ections becomes an appropriate determination of the factor VIII plastic bar . &quot;
individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII to achieve different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different se@@ wer@@ ies .
3 Pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis Z@@ ur long @-@ term prophy@@ la@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 by factor VIII per kilo@@ gram body weight at the distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII plasma activities cannot be reached or if the bleeding is not dominated by a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out to detect an inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so other therapeutic interventions need to be wei@@ ghed . &quot;
the maintenance @-@ speed is intended to address the patient after the patient , whereby a maximum inj@@ ector rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutral antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
&quot; these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say . &quot;
&quot; the risk of developing in@@ em@@ bit@@ ors , cor@@ relate with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk is dependent on the first 20 Ex@@ posi@@ tional stage and on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; for pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 expression days and an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ sch @-@ known In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or@@ development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII @-@ product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( humili@@ ating ) In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of the hem@@ ophi@@ lia A for women , the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breastfeeding has no experiences . &quot;
&quot; the AD@@ R@@ s in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who were all infected in previously untreated patients , which have a higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ ache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( each 3 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 up to &lt; 1 / 1 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on the available data is not invaluable ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of the patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . b ) The unexpected waste of the blood @-@ inn@@ ate factor VIII @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els entered post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10th - 14th post @-@ surgical day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror in the plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th post @-@ surgical day .
clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate Ha@@ m@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII &lt; 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentrations ( ≥ 150 days ) showed only a patient after 26 exposure days with A@@ DV@@ ATE a low inhibit@@ ors ( 2.@@ 4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition one of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of 6 years and diagnosed ( F@@ VIII &lt; 2 % ) after prior exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentrations ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or .
&quot; in previously , patients of a current clinical study conducted 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE , patients infected inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII . &quot;
the immune response of patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by the investigation of antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant increase as well as an ongoing peak of antibodies against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell , but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms related to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; four patients have been unified over the appearance of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number e@@ os@@ in@@ ophil@@ es Gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes at several repeti@@ tive product positions within the study . &quot;

&quot; based on the data available since the first inspection data , the CH@@ MP has continued to assess the benefits risk assessment , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP based on the safety pro@@ filing of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a filing of PS@@ UR@@ s all 6 months needed , decided that the filing was supposed to apply for in 5 years another extension procedure . &quot;
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited ( CH@@ MP ) officially distributed to the Committee on Human Physi@@ cs ( CH@@ MP ) officially with that the company takes its request for approval from Adv@@ ex@@ in to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
&quot; however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the past@@ ure parts ( tissues , the other structures in the body connect , surround and base ) . &quot;
this is a type of virus that genetically modified so that it can wear a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; in the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in , it is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been changed so that there are no copies of themselves and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ex@@ in would have inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , and thus allow cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is made from which not defective in the human body is formed at the existing p@@ 53 gene , normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer , where the p@@ 53 @-@ gene defect is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer@@ ous cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company submitted data from a study with a patient , at the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the range of under@@ mining , in the bones , and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had tested the answers of the company on the questions posed by the company , there were still some questions un@@ solved . &quot;
&quot; based on the audit of the submitted documentation , the CH@@ MP issued a day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company . &quot;
according to the CH@@ MP opinion was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors will bring benefits to the patient .
&quot; the committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug , in the body , the type of administration , as well as the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
&quot; the company did not inform the CH@@ MP , whether the withdrawal of consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or &quot; Com@@ missions Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in . &quot;
changed drug release &quot; means that the tablets are so assembled that one of the effective components immediately and the other slowly will be released over a few hours .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal @-@ allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever , caused by an allergy to pol@@ len inflammation of the nas@@ al passages ) in patients with nose @-@ grin@@ ds ( hidden nose ) . &quot;
&quot; for adults and young people from 12 years onwards , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily , which should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and finished once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nose @-@ s@@ skin ( hidden nose ) . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be traced to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
&quot; the main effective , the changes in the sword of the ha@@ y @-@ up symptoms , reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment were reported . &quot;
&quot; during the study , the patients received their symptoms all 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard sc@@ ala , how hard the symptoms had been in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; considering all hypo@@ cris@@ y symptoms , except the sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients , the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze recorded , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patient , the pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nose @-@ s@@ fores@@ kin was seen , the patients under aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a reli@@ eving the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26,@@ 7 % against the patients who were dis@@ qui@@ at@@ ly alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed from 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , but@@ ton@@ ic hyper@@ activity ( throat infection ) , swelling , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nie ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ enz ( sle@@ ep@@ iness ) , in@@ som@@ ing disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may be used in patients who may possibly super@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other components , against in@@ ep@@ in@@ ep@@ herds agents or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) are not applied . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients suffering from a bot@@ t@@ apping glau@@ coma ( increased eye pressure ) , coron@@ ary or vas@@ cular disease ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ osis ( over@@ functioning of the thy@@ roid ) or have already caused a hem@@ at@@ las stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission adopted the company SP Europe a permit to the transport of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is to swal@@ low in the whole ( i.e. without removing them to cr@@ ush or che@@ wing ) . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should be applied due to the lack of data to un@@ thin@@ kable and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) not for children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms of symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the use period on 10 days since in long @-@ term application the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can take time .
&quot; after the fall of the swelling of the mu@@ cos@@ as in the upper respiratory , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ ad@@ ad@@ in as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; da Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within 2 weeks after completion of such treatment . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , Per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ inet , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ Phr@@ in , eph@@ edr@@ ine , oxide , ox@@ y@@ met@@ ac@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; the security and effectiveness of this combination therapy have not been reviewed for this patient collective , and the data are not sufficient to speak corresponding recommendations for dosage . &quot;
safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver therapy and do not submit the data to speak corresponding recommendations for dosage .
&quot; patients must be informed about that treatment at the appearance of a hyper@@ ton@@ ie or a tick , cardi@@ ac disease , nausea or any other neurological symptoms ( such as headaches or rein@@ forcement of head@@ ache ) must be cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of the following patients , patients under D@@ IG@@ IT@@ AL@@ IS • patients with cardi@@ ac disease • patients with hypertension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ d@@ attack in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is to prevent at least 48 hours before performing the mat@@ ologically tests since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce in their extent .
&quot; as part of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol was additionally administered , however , no clinical @-@ relevant interactions or changes in plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in were observed . &quot;
&quot; during the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests , there were no significant differences between the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ ad@@ in and the patients treated with placebo , regardless of whether a lor@@ ence was taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme used for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzymes was not yet identified , so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely excluded . &quot;
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in inhi@@ bited in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ kop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ consistency of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , no increase in the frequency of abnorm@@ alities compared to the incidence of normal population . &quot;
&quot; since Re@@ production studies on animals can not always be transferred to humans , and on the basis of the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ k@@ tor@@ ped@@ ic properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; patients should be informed about it , however , that it may occur in very rare cases to a ben@@ evol@@ ence , which can lead to impairment of traffic ti@@ ghtness , or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms can vary between a Z@@ NS depression ( se@@ dation , Ap@@ no@@ e , reduced mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tering processes . &quot;
&quot; head@@ ache , anxiety , complic@@ ity mi@@ xes , muscle tissues and increased muscle tone , euph@@ oria , inflammation , respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency , nausea , vom@@ iting , fri@@ zz@@ ie , visual distur@@ ban@@ ces and hyper@@ ton@@ ic or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; a T@@ NS stimulation is especially likely , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth@@ wash , p@@ up@@ ill@@ ar and - di@@ lat@@ ation , bon@@ ding , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ fan@@ ic cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 , and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ cells / Bas@@ ophi@@ le as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the additive molecule P @-@ Sel@@ ek@@ tin on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ cells . &quot;
&quot; a single dose study involving adults showed des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg no influence on standard measurement sizes , including the strengthening of subjective anxiety or the tasks connected with flying . &quot;
controlled clinical trials were found in controlled dose of 5 mg daily no increased frequency of sle@@ ep@@ iness compared to placebo .
&quot; the or@@ ale application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause further lik@@ om@@ im@@ e@@ tic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ ts or manifestations of a T@@ NS arousal . &quot;
&quot; it took 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal @-@ allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients received Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies the hist@@ am@@ in@@ antagon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the overall scores of the symptom ( except nas@@ al s@@ skin swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nose @-@ skin swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic affili@@ ation . &quot;
as part of a single dose study to the phar@@ yn@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma .

&quot; as part of a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dimension@@ ally study , which was performed with the formulation as a tablet on healthy adult subjects , has been noted that four subjects were mis@@ diagnosed in bad symptoms . &quot;
a component Inter@@ actions Study that exposure ( C@@ max and Au@@ c ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in bio@@ en@@ qui@@ valence was for exposure to a aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on the security of security , toxicity , toxicity and reproduction treatment , the pre@@ clinical data with dis@@ lor@@ ity can be seen no special dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination has no greater toxicity than their individual components , and the observed effects were generally linked to the ingredient pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; in reproductive @-@ sto@@ xi@@ al studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in / pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and not rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day not ter@@ ato@@ gen . &quot;

A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and young people with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies with seasonal @-@ allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies of patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
&quot; the effectiveness has been measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the tr@@ ams , impairment of sleep and the performance on the day ) before and after six @-@ week treatment was determined . &quot;
&quot; there have been further studies submitted to em@@ ulate that the body values the sy@@ rup , the solution to inhal@@ ing and melt in the same way as the tablets and the use in children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies have been taken together , the two weeks treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us to an average decrease in the symptom has reached 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients who received a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in both studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria amounted to six weeks treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % in the patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be sur@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; January 2001 , the European Commission adopted the Company SP Europe a permit to the in@@ filtration of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent Rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience from clinical trials to the effectiveness in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( symptoms of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be termin@@ ated according to the previous path@@ ways and can be resum@@ ed after the end of symptoms and with their re@@ occur .
in the pers@@ isting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( symptoms of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) the patient can be recommended during the allergy period a lasting treatment .
&quot; clinical @-@ relevant interactions were not found in the context of clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets , where Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol was additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study the simultaneous effect of alcohol is not ampli@@ fied ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; patients should be informed about it , however , that in very rare cases it may come to ben@@ om@@ men@@ ity , which can lead to impairment of traffic ti@@ ghtness , or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects , which was reported more often than in placebo , fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , oral dry ( 0.@@ 8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common side @-@ effect head@@ ache , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of the patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ ad@@ ad@@ in and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; administered in a multi @-@ quality dose , administered by up to 45 mg dis@@ lor@@ ad@@ in ( nin@@ ety clinical dosage ) , no clinical @-@ relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ fan@@ ic cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 , and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ cells / Bas@@ ophi@@ le as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the additive molecule P @-@ Sel@@ ek@@ tin on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ al@@ cells . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of a clinical study with multi @-@ user identi@@ fiers , in a dosage administered of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in a dosage administered by 45 mg daily ( the ninth of the clinical dosage ) than ten days administered , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls showed itself . &quot;
&quot; with an individual dos@@ is@@ - study with adults showed des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg no influence on standard measurement sizes , including the strengthening of subjective anxiety or the tasks connected with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ eg@@ rets , tri@@ but@@ ary , and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can be divided into dependence on the duration of symptoms also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and pers@@ isting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
pers@@ isting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the appearance of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks .
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall scores of the frac@@ ture for the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ economy ti@@ vi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ished by seasonal @-@ allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was investig@@ ating for further forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria as the underlying path@@ physiological ology irrespective of the e@@ ti@@ ology of the different forms is similar and chronic patients can be rec@@ tified .
&quot; as the history of history is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular diseases , is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in except in other forms of Ur@@ tik@@ aria leads to an improvement of symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effective in enhancing Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of qu@@ add@@ les at the end of the first tin inter@@ v@@ alls .
&quot; as in other studies with Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka at chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the minority of the patients who did not react to Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka , from the study . &quot;
an improvement in the itch to more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ ry in comparison to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of the sleep and the wax , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a phar@@ yn@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which the patients de@@ aler@@ ts were allergic to the general seasonal @-@ population Pop@@ ulation , was achieved with 4 % of the patients a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
there are no clue to a clin@@ ically relevant di@@ ulation after once daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
&quot; however , the enzyme used for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzymes was not yet identified , so that interactions with other drugs are not entirely excluded . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in hem@@ med in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ kop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; in a single dos@@ is@@ ler study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of 7.5 mg applied meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie breakfast ) not on the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the clinical trials of Des@@ lor@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in carried out pre@@ clinical trials , at a comparable level of exposure of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to toxicity of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and from Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on the security of security , toxicity in repeated gift , genom@@ ics and for Re@@ production @-@ sto@@ x@@ ic@@ ity the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ ad@@ ad@@ in cannot be recognized for humans . &quot;

&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken regardless of meals , to allevi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of Rh@@ initi@@ s are caused in children under 2 years by infection ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) and that no data is available to support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es should play a role in diagnosis the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , physical investigations and corresponding laboratory studies . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between the ages of 2 and 11 are metabo@@ li@@ zing Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and experience a higher sub@@ stan@@ z@@ load ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up at children between 2 and 11 years , which are restricted metabolic disorders , is identical to the children &apos;s normal metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; this drug contains Sac@@ char@@ ose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients should not use her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intolerance , glucose , in@@ suffici@@ ency in@@ suffici@@ ency or in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine . &quot;
&quot; clinical @-@ relevant interactions were not found in the context of clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol was additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study involving as@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol was not ampli@@ fied by as@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the overall prevalence of side @-@ effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar at the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup Group as with the placebo group .
&quot; clinical trials with adults and young people in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; administered in a multi @-@ quality dose of adults and adolescents , administered up to 45 mg dis@@ lor@@ ad@@ in ( ninete@@ en clinical dosage ) , no clinical @-@ relevant effects were observed . &quot;
children aged between 1 and 11 years old who came into question for an anti@@ hist@@ amine dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( between the ages of 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( between the ages of 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in with adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in adults can be extr@@ ap@@ ulated in adults to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of a clinical study with multi @-@ disciplinary an adult and juven@@ iles , used in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and young people , in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ninth of the clinical dose ) has been applied over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls showed itself . &quot;
controlled clinical trials were found at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of sle@@ ep@@ iness compared to placebo .
&quot; in a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and young people in clinical trials have no impairment of psych@@ omot@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies of adults , it was not imp@@ aired by the simultaneous intake of alcohol or to increase the alcohol induced performance imp@@ aired even to an increase in the sle@@ ep@@ iness . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as kidney , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ eg@@ rets , tri@@ but@@ ary , and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall scores of the frac@@ ture for the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ economy ti@@ vi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets are effective caused by seasonal @-@ allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effective in enhancing Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of qu@@ add@@ les at the end of the first tin inter@@ v@@ alls .
&quot; the dissemination of this restricted metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sians ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ disciplinary study with the Sir@@ up@@ formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s who are restricted .
&quot; the loading ( Au@@ c ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was after 3 to 6 hours , approximately 6@@ times higher and the C@@ max approximately 3 to 4@@ times higher with a time period of about 120 hours . &quot;
&quot; there are no clue to a clin@@ ically relevant ingredient , after a daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and young people . &quot;
&quot; 12 In different individual dose @-@ studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients were comparable with those of adults , who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; however , the enzyme used for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzymes was not yet identified , so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely excluded . &quot;

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l officially distributed to the Committee on Human Physi@@ cs ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company takes its request for approval by A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 @-@ influenza in adults and elderly people .
&quot; A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied in adults and older people to protect the flu , which is caused by the trunk ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus . &quot;
this is a special kind of vaccine administered by a strain of flu virus that might cause a future pan@@ demic .
&quot; a flu pan@@ demic breaks out , when a new strain of influenza virus is emerging , which can easily spread from person to person because people still have no immunity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognises the immune system contained in the vaccine as &quot; physical foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system later is able to form in a contact with a grip virus of this gene@@ ms faster antibodies . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membran@@ es of the virus marked with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membran@@ es of the membran@@ es that det@@ ects the human body as a body @-@ alien ) , united and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
a inspection of some of the studies showed that the study has not been carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; in this way , the extent of the clinical data base for evaluating the security of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ demic vaccines . &quot;
&quot; if you are interested in clinical testing and need more information on your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you want more information on the basis of the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is applied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years working with human immun@@ ode@@ ficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which are causing the acquired immun@@ ode@@ ficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who can not swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ is may be taken as a solution to inhal@@ ing , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the security of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has tested , which anti @-@ viral medicines has previously been taken , and probability assessed that the virus is to address the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily mg bis@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of ax@@ ase depends on the body weight . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase reduces intake in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines the HIV amount in blood and keeps them at a low level .
&quot; AIDS not to heal AIDS , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and therefore also delay the development of associated infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medication , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , who had previously not been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; that with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicines A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with 20@@ 6 adults , who had previously taken protest against other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ers . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with un@@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change of virus last after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously had no protein avoidance , although after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase more patients had a virus last less than 400 copies / ml than under placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children decreased A@@ gener@@ ase also decreased the virus last , but with the children who were previously treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ tics , were very few to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving adults , who had been treated earlier with prot@@ e@@ as@@ po@@ urs , lowered the virus with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , for 16 @-@ weeks treatment as effectively as other prot@@ e@@ as@@ po@@ inters : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ e@@ as@@ tical , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the virus last after four weeks as with the patients , who received their previous prot@@ e@@ as@@ po@@ orer : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in over 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( vom@@ iting ) , nausea , rash and F@@ gue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be sur@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ ic@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may also not be applied in patients using cur@@ rant ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines , which are just like as@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood of health . &quot;
&quot; as with other drugs against HIV , the A@@ gener@@ ase is taking the risk of a Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , a oste@@ o@@ ek@@ y ( symptoms of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection which are caused by the recre@@ ative immune system ) . &quot;
the EP committee on Human Physi@@ cs ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ gener@@ ase is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat cancer @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years over the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic multip@@ licity , but the committee stated that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase is taken in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not have a prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ or . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; because at the time the approval for scientific reasons only limited information .
October 2000 the European Commission adopted the G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited to adopt A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ tical ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
for usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be given to pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ stery of am@@ moni@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r should take place under consideration of the individual viral remains and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take up is 14 % less than a capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for inhal@@ ing on a milli@@ gram pro milli@@ gram is not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying supplement of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ st@@ fication ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ moni@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the phar@@ yn@@ o@@ genetics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ e@@ as@@ tics were not examined in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data for im@@ mortality and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ o@@ genetic data , the dose should be reduced to A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver disorder on 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions on 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
simultaneous application should be done in patients with lighter or more liver therapy with caution in patients with severe liver dysfunction it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ is must not be given simultaneously with drugs that possess a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ en@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal supplements containing cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) may not be applied because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
&quot; the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot;
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be applied together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and are treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver impacts with potentially deadly disease .
&quot; in case of simultaneous viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information on this medicine . &quot;
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including chronic hepatitis hepatitis show an increased incidence of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored in accordance with clinical practice .
simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ate or other Glu@@ c@@ co@@ stero@@ ids that are confused about C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment weighs a risk of systemic cor@@ ster@@ oi@@ ent effects including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and Sup@@ pression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; as the metabolism of the H@@ M@@ G Co@@ A reduc@@ er inhibit@@ or Lov@@ mer Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin is dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , an simultaneous administration of axi@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin is not recommended for the increased risk of My@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International standardization rati@@ os ) , are available methods for determining the ingredient concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ is may be less effective because of decreased plastic bars of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills can be altered , however the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be surve@@ yed at O@@ pi@@ vot@@ al symptoms , especially if there are still low doses from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the possible risk of risk of toxicity due to the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ col@@ ates of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patients . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to duration 5 , if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ cos@@ as is involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ e@@ as@@ po@@ orer , has been reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an ex@@ her@@ edi@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases whose therapy drugs were needed to be associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug addic@@ tive factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in h@@ ec@@ ophil@@ es patients ( Type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ase , are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous hem@@ ost@@ al hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune def@@ aults may develop an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections , which leads to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial etheric body is accepted ( including the application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol intake , heavy immun@@ o@@ ids , higher Body Mass Index ) , cases of Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose were particularly reported in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not simultaneously be given to pharmaceuticals which have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ en@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined together with pharmaceuticals whose agents are primarily associated with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are connected to the increased plastic bars with severe and / or life @-@ threatening effects .
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is a 82 % reduction in the Au@@ c von Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; at the attempt to eradic@@ ate the reduced plastic bar through a dosage increase of other protein @-@ inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently unwanted effects on the liver were observed . &quot;
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) The ser@@ um levels of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r can be lower by the simultaneous application of vegetable preparations with Johann@@ is@@ wort ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) .
&quot; when a patient gets already cur@@ rant , the an@@ kl@@ ash level and , if possible to check the Vir@@ us@@ last and put the cur@@ rant . &quot;
a dosage adjustment for one of the medicine is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ on ) .
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max to reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r has been applied twice daily , which occupy the effectiveness and im@@ purity of this treatment schem@@ atas . &quot;
52 % humili@@ ated if Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administered .
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r in the plasma , which were achieved during the combination of am@@ ic@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg Lop@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dosage recommended for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ etra cannot be given , however , there is however a narro@@ wer supervision recommended since the effectiveness and obs@@ cures of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there has been no pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic study on the use of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in recommended , however , due to the anta@@ sia component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase is at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
therefore the gift of E@@ f@@ avi@@ ca is used in combination with Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and no dosage adjustment required .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ca in combination with Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both protein fraud would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in to other prot@@ e@@ as@@ po@@ orer and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in the ser@@ um@@ con@@ centric of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r may lo@@ wers .
&quot; if these medicines should be used simultaneously , caution is advisable , because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the decreased / or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plastic bar . &quot;
&quot; if these medicines are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made as an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( Au@@ c ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at 19@@ 3 % and thus related to an increase in the associated side effects .
&quot; if it is required for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin to be administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase , becomes a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available . &quot;
pharmaceutical studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out but could be increased the plastic bar of both drugs in the case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous application of twice a day 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ moni@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in comparison to the value that has been observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily without simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ ic@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines which are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or in@@ duction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can , if they are applied together with A@@ gener@@ ase , possibly can lead to interactions . &quot;
patients should therefore be associated to toxic reactions which are associated with these drugs if they are applied in combination with as@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ase , it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da will not be taken at the same time as as@@ gener@@ ase as it can come to res@@ oral disorders . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ ants known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r can lead to a humili@@ ation of the Plas@@ tic@@ avi@@ r bar . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium concentrations like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Zo@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@
&quot; simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plas@@ tic@@ ulations considerably and ampli@@ fy with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection to side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ times daily ) over 7 days of commission income , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plastic bar rose significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol rose by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ Con@@ fi@@ den@@ um interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous Gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended together with these Glu@@ c@@ ok@@ or@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , unless the potential benefits of a treatment weighs a risk of systemic cor@@ ster@@ oi@@ des . ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with H@@ M@@ G @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose metabolism is heavily dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , have pronounced height of Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ens at simultaneous administration with current administration of A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
since Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ ds increased from this H@@ M@@ G @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to My@@ opathy including a car@@ n@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this medicine is not recommended with Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; it will be recommended a more common monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to the stabili@@ zation of the mirror , as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased at the simultaneous gift of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase is not allowed to be applied together with oral uni@@ form@@ em mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while at the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
data on the simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ bit@@ ors point to a possible increase in plastic bars of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3@@ - to 4 @-@ times .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one administered together with Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be surve@@ yed at O@@ pi@@ vot@@ al symptoms , especially if there are still low doses from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the low reliability of historical comparisons , currently no recommendation is given , as the Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose is to be adjusted , if Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International standardization , rati@@ o ) is recommended because of the possibility of sealing off or rein@@ forcement of the anti @-@ anthrop@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive is not fores@@ ee@@ able , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot;
a careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side @-@ effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in current Gift of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied to the potential risks of fet@@ us for the mother in comparison to the potential risks of fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk l@@ actic rats were detected Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances , however , it is not known whether Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r is over@@ flowing with people in the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
a reproduction study at the toler@@ able rats which was administered by the inc@@ ist@@ ung in the uter@@ us up to the end of the down@@ time Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r was demonstrated during the lac@@ tation period a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight loss .
further development of descendants including Fer@@ til@@ ity and Re@@ production capacity was not imp@@ aired by the administration of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r to the mother@@ tier .
the in@@ consistency of A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years onwards in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most with the A@@ gener@@ ase @-@ treatment side effects were slightly up to moderate , occurred early on and often led to the treatment outbreak . &quot;
&quot; many of these events are not clarified , whether they are applied in connection with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or any other at the same time to HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side @-@ side effects originate from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ers not pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day . &quot;
&quot; events ( degrees 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ator than in connection with study media , and in more than 1 % of the patients were performed , as well as under the treatment advances ( degrees 3 to 4 ) are listed . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy has been associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy ) in HIV @-@ patients , including a loss of peripher@@ al and in@@ toxic@@ al fat tissues , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and thor@@ n cervi@@ cal tissues ( Sti@@ ckers ) . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ active non @-@ treated persons , which were treated with Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ u@@ dine / Zi@@ dov@@ u@@ dine over a medium run of 36 weeks , was only observed ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , at 2@@ 45 N@@ RT@@ I@@ - pre @-@ treated patients under Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in combination with various N@@ RT@@ Is over a medium length of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin irritation were normally easy to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ atic or macro @-@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred usually during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without having to dis@@ car@@ ded the treatment with Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; cases of Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose were particularly reported in patients with generally known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune def@@ aults may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections . ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre@@ treated patients , 600 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily , were kind and frequency of side effects ( degrees 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degrees 2 to 4 ) and lab changes ( degrees 2 to 4 ) and lab changes ( degrees 3 and 4 ) , which were obtained in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase along with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very common . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , are necessary support measures . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents process viral and G@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ levels , with the consequence of a formation of non @-@ infectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti @-@ viral activity of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both in acute and chron@@ ically @-@ infected cell@@ ar@@ hob@@ las@@ tic cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) , as well as in peri@@ ph@@ onic blood@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; the 50 % inhibit@@ or de@@ centr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r is located in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µm with acute cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm with chronic cells &quot;
the connection between the activity of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and the inhibit@@ ing of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication is not yet defined .

&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes through additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpre@@ tations systems for analy@@ zing the results of resistance tests . &quot;
on Pho@@ en@@ otyp@@ ic res@@ ists based analysis Bla@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otype systems can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for the assessment of the activity of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ ic@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ase @-@ resistant insulation .
companies that exp@@ el diagnostic res@@ ists have been clin@@ ically developed clinical @-@ phen@@ otype Cut @-@ offs ( divi@@ ders ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV that can be applied to interpre@@ ting results of a res@@ hap@@ haz@@ ard .
&quot; each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r associate gene@@ tical pattern creates a certain cross resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r but is generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on the cross resistance between Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ers for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ moni@@ avi@@ r remains , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ fitted patients with which a Fos@@ am@@ opo@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; in the other way , Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other protein @-@ resistant insulation material ; the conservation of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early departure of a promising therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits that can affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; the evidence of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ cl@@ o@@ si@@ dan@@ alo@@ ga ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , so@@ c ) with a PI , predominantly with lowest Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; , &quot; received . &quot;
&quot; one hundred thre@@ es@@ sixty ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I have been included in the part @-@ study group A by PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ rep@@ airing of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the So@@ C @-@ PI group in the plasma last 16 weeks with a non @-@ under@@ weight wave of 0.@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
&quot; the evidence of the effectiveness of un@@ f@@ oo@@ ster@@ ated A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 , of whom 152 with PI were pre @-@ treated . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase is used to take and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; it has been given no low @-@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , at the same time ; the majority of people with PI @-@ treated patients had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ RT@@ Is . &quot;
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of the patients included a plasma @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ ate increase in the CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) opposite the output value .
&quot; 19 basics of these data should be considered in the treatment optim@@ isation , with PI @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; il@@ oo@@ ster@@ ated &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
50@@ 8 % increases for C@@ max to reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; the administration of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % cancellation of the Au@@ c , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ influenced by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake influence the scale and rate of the remains . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume is about 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be traced to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ dimin@@ ished penetration of am@@ ic@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of the active ingredient in plasma , with the quantity of un@@ developed Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r that represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ born Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r remains constant , fluctu@@ ates the percentage part of the free active component in the ste@@ alth state in the ste@@ ady state over the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines must indu@@ ce C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or inhibit@@ or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution administered if they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg times a day , leads to a similar daily am@@ moni@@ avi@@ r exposure like in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bi@@ dding than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ grams . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore might be the effect of a kidney disorder on the Eli@@ mination of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
this treatment schem@@ ata lead to am@@ ic@@ avi@@ r plastic mask comparable to those that achieves a dose of 1200 mg am@@ ic@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for se@@ al@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats occurred at male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ ato@@ ell@@ ular Aden@@ ome on men who , after 2,@@ 0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - triple ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily gift from 1200 mg am@@ moni@@ avi@@ r , said . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hep@@ ato@@ genic aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ oma were still not tested and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , from the present exposure data on human beings , both clinical trials and the therapeutic application , there are little evidence of accepting a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery for In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ tests , the bacterial Re@@ verse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ ly@@ mph@@ oma test , micro@@ phones test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ en@@ ab@@ err@@ ation on human peri@@ ph@@ ate lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r , or gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxicity may be monitored and detected in clinical everyday life by measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; so far , in clinical studies there has not been any significant liver toxicity in patients , either during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase or after the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies of tox@@ ic@@ ity with juven@@ iles , which were treated at an age of 4 days , demonstrated a high mor@@ aine . &quot;
&quot; in a systemic Plas@@ ma@@ ths , the significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the anticipated exposure to therapeu@@ tical dosage was observed in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus glands and minor skel@@ etal changes observed to a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying supplement of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ st@@ fication ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ moni@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous application should be done in patients with p@@ aving or easier liver disorder with caution when patients with severe liver dysfunction is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; 26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International standardization rati@@ os ) , are available methods for determining the ingredient concentration . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to duration 27 , if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ cos@@ as is involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an increased risk of a Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug addic@@ tive factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is a 82 % reduction in the Au@@ c von Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max to reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r in the plasma , which were achieved during the combination of am@@ ic@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg Lop@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dosage recommended for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ etra cannot be given , however , there is however a narro@@ wer supervision recommended since the effectiveness and obs@@ cures of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ca in combination with Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both protein fraud would be low .
&quot; if these medicines are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made as an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is required for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin to be administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase , becomes a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data available . &quot;
&quot; ser@@ um concentrations of calcium concentrations like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Zo@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine , Ni@@ fi@@ pine ,
&quot; in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ times daily ) over 7 days of commission income , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plastic bar rose significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol rose by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ Con@@ fi@@ den@@ um interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International standardization , rati@@ o ) is recommended because of the possibility of sealing off or rein@@ forcement of the anti @-@ anthrop@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl@@ est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.@@ 0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) led to a decrease of the Au@@ c and C@@ min by Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r by 22 % b@@ z@@ w .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied to the potential risks for the fo@@ etus in comparison to the potential risks of the fet@@ us . &quot;
a reproduction study at the ch@@ asti@@ ty r@@ atten , which was administered by the inc@@ ist@@ ung in the uter@@ us up to the end of the down@@ time Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r , was demonstrated during the lac@@ tation period a dimin@@ ished increase in the weight of the body . &quot;
the in@@ consistency of A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years onwards in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , are necessary support measures . &quot;
&quot; the anti @-@ viral activity of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both in acute and chron@@ ically @-@ infected cell@@ ar@@ hob@@ las@@ tic cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) , as well as peripher@@ y blood@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; the 50 % inhibit@@ or de@@ centr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r is located in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm in acute cells ( 1 µm = 0,@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; in the other way , Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other protein @-@ resistant insulation material ; the conservation of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , should be considered in the treatment optim@@ isation of with PI @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; un@@ ted &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ born Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r remains consistent , the percentage of free active components during the dosage inter@@ v@@ alls during the dosage inter@@ mitt@@ ent in the ste@@ ady state over the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines must indu@@ ce C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or inhibit@@ or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution administered if they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
also the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the impact of a kidney disorder on the Eli@@ mination of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be small .
in long @-@ term studies for se@@ al@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats occurred with male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ ato@@ ell@@ ular Aden@@ ome with lec@@ tur@@ ers to the 2.@@ 0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - triple ( rat ) of exposure to man after twice daily gift from 1200 mg am@@ moni@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of hep@@ ato@@ cel@@ ular Aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ oma has not yet been reviewed yet and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , from the present exposure data on human beings , both clinical trials and the therapeutic application , there were little evidence of accepting a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery for In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ tests , micro ly@@ mph@@ oma test , micro@@ controller tests on rats and chromos@@ om@@ en@@ ab@@ err@@ ation on human peri@@ ph@@ ate lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , am@@ ic@@ avi@@ r was neither nuts nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; studies of tox@@ ic@@ ity with juven@@ iles , which were treated at an age of 4 days , demonstrated a high mor@@ aine . &quot;
&quot; these results can be concluded that in juven@@ iles , the Met@@ abol@@ ization are not yet fully mature , so Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for installation is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ tical ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
&quot; the benefit of having Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; m@@ oo@@ ster@@ ous &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inhal@@ ing has not been treated with PI pre@@ treated patients , nor with PI pre@@ treated patients . &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take up is 14 % less than a capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for inhal@@ ing on a milli@@ gram pro milli@@ gram is not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules filled with taking the solution to inhal@@ ing ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.@@ 1 ml ) Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 2@@ 800 mg am@@ moni@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; additionally , since no dosage recommendations must be given for the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to inhal@@ ing and low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided , this combination with these patients . &quot;
&quot; although a dosage adjustment is not necessary for am@@ ic@@ avi@@ r , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to inhal@@ ed in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic response as a result of high prop@@ ylene gly@@ col@@ ates , A@@ gener@@ is solution for inhal@@ ing in small children and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure . &quot;
the simultaneous administration can lead to a competitive inhibit@@ ing of these medicines and possibly cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening effects caused like cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
&quot; the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent risk 47 of a transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot;
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International standardization rati@@ os ) , are available methods for determining the ingredient concentration . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to duration when a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ cos@@ as is involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an increased risk of a Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with pharmaceutical medium 49 dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in h@@ ec@@ ophil@@ es patients ( Type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ase , are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous hem@@ ost@@ al hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ es . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is a 82 % reduction in the Au@@ c von Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max to reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plas@@ tic@@ ulations considerably and lead to P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection to side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
based on data to 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors are largely anticipated by Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk to human being is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase solution to inhal@@ ing may not be applied due to possible toxicity of fet@@ us on the contained prop@@ ylene gly@@ col in pregnancy ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the milk l@@ actic rats were detected Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances , however , it is not known whether Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r is over@@ flowing with people in the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
a reproduction study at the ch@@ asti@@ ty r@@ atten , which was administered by the inc@@ ist@@ ung in the uter@@ us up to the end of the down@@ time Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r , was demonstrated during the lac@@ tation period a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 body weight . &quot;
the in@@ consistency of A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years onwards in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; many of these events are not clarified , whether they are applied in connection with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or any other at the same time to HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the disease . &quot;
in the treatment anti @-@ backward patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ moni@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages - like with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ oo@@ st@@ em@@ bit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described only rarely observed .
early departure of an enchanted 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits that can affect the subsequent treatment .
62 basics of this data should be considered in the treatment optim@@ isation of with PI @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; Un@@ le@@ oo@@ ster@@ ated &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase .

&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies at 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete deriv@@ ative of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined at 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma in two studies , where patients were treated six weeks or twice a week or five times a week . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete indul@@ gence of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ants .
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In case of treatment of war@@ ms in the genital area , the complete deriv@@ ative rate of 66 % up to 52 % were combined with placebo @-@ treated patients , but only 3 % to 80 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a treat patients compared to 0 % up to 3 % in the placebo group . &quot;

&quot; an interruption in the methods described above should be wei@@ ghed if intense local inflammation occur ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) , or if in the treatment area a infection is observed . &quot;
&quot; if at the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the lesi@@ ons were only incomplete , should be started a different therapy ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; when a dose was left out , the patient should pay the cream as soon as he / she notices it and then continue with the usual therapy plan . &quot;

&quot; it should be associated with these patients a break , between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their autoimmune disease . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , there should be a decrease in these patients between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ@@ ig@@ ame or Gra@@ ft @-@ Center @-@ host@@ - reaction . &quot;
&quot; in other studies where no daily pre @-@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ate was conducted , two cases of severe p@@ hi@@ mos@@ is were observed and a case with one for circumc@@ ision &apos;s leading stri@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended cans , an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , there were severe local skin irritation that made a treatment required and / or to a temporary physical impairment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the output of the ure@@ th@@ ra , some women had trouble passing urine , which required a not@@ ary ca@@ ter@@ ization and a treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , directly after the treatment with other cut@@ aneous agents in the treatment of external cases of genital war@@ ts in the genital and peripher@@ al range , there is no clinical experience until now . &quot;

local skin @-@ actions are common but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or reactions after completing the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
&quot; if it is necessary due to the discomfort of the patient or due to the severity of the local skin interactions , a treatment break can be made of several days . &quot;
clinical results of therapy can be assessed after the treatment of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .

local skin @-@ actions often occur but these reactions usually take off during the treatment of intensity or go back after putting the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
&quot; if the local hood transactions are likely to cause great discomfort or are very strong , treatment can be exposed for several days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 AK@@ G lesi@@ ons showed a lower full healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive treatment ( see 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;

&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ ca@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ ca@@ es , g@@ ags ) will not be disman@@ tled and thus s@@ hab@@ by in most organs in the body and those ashamed . &quot;
&quot; following neurological symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , the movements difficult , reduced lung volume , heart and eye diseases . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
&quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out in a hospital or clinic with re@@ cl@@ adding equipment , and patients may need appropriate medicines to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; in the study , primarily the safety of the drug was examined , but it was also measured by its effectiveness ( by examining its effect in relation to reducing G@@ ag concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; for children under five years old Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , the G@@ ag concentrations in the urine are around 60 % , and half of the treated children reported a normal large liver in the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed at more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headaches , nausea , abdom@@ inal pain , skin pain , pain , pain , pain , pain and reactions to the in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may be used in patients who may possibly be extremely sensitive ( allergic ) to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) , not applied . &quot;
&quot; every year the European Drug Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will be able to test all new information , which may be known and to update this summary . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients , the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , with regard to the reactions to in@@ fusion and development of antibodies . &quot;
June 2003 the European Commission shared the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. has been approved for the in@@ filtration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms across the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human@@ en α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ able DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , Ei@@ erst@@ enst@@ ock of Chinese Ham@@ sters ) . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is available for long @-@ time enzymes for patients with spot@@ ted diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sis I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase @-@ defect ) to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried through a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient is wearing this , every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms for adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no faculty scheme can be recommended .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure have not been determined and for these patients no faculty scheme can be recommended .
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , patients may develop in@@ fusion @-@ conditioned reactions which are defined as any side effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be supervised , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made available in a reasonable clinical environment , at the re@@ vit@@ re@@ ation facilities for medical emergency accidents . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , virtually all patients Ig@@ G antibodies form against larv@@ on@@ id@@ ase generally form within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion reaction must be treated with caution when applying Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; since there is little experience regarding the resum@@ ption of the treatment after a longer break , due to the theoretical increased risk assessment required after a break of treatment carefully . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ p@@ ics ) to treat the potential occurrence @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of light or moderate @-@ heavy in@@ fusion reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be wei@@ ghed and / or a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half of the fusion rate , in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , heavy in@@ fusion reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms associated with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is considering . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be recorded with a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate where the reaction occurred has occurred .
3 are ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) as well as a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular image of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; veterinary studies cannot be taken on direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; because no data in new@@ bor@@ ns that were expon@@ entially compared to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , is recommended during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
the side @-@ effects in clinical trials were predominantly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ conditioned reactions which were observed at 53 % of patients in phase 3 trial ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) were observed .
unwanted medication reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms that have been observed during the phase 3 years or older at a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years are performed in the following table ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper air@@ ways and lungs in the pre @-@ history there were heavy reactions to , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus , air@@ still@@ s and facial hair ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children un@@ favorable medicine impacts related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a ph@@ as@@ ure 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predominantly severe form of course and a treatment duration up to 12 months , reported are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every two weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients , within 3 months after the treatment of treatment to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version , the majority of patients aged under 5 years of age came to a Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version ( average after 26 days compared with patients aged 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature departure from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients had no det@@ ectable antibodies before , including 3 patients , where it has never been a serv@@ o version . &quot;
patients with lack of low antibodies made a robust decrease in the G@@ ag @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els in the har@@ n while in patients with high antibody ti@@ tern was a variable reduction of G@@ ag in the har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in Phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ ally to low neutr@@ alized inhibit@@ or activity in vit@@ ro that seemed to not imp@@ air the clinical effectiveness and / or reducing G@@ ag in Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies seemed not to stand in connection with the incidence of unwanted medication reactions , even if the appearance of unwanted drug transactions typically fell together with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the reasoning for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ strate and preventing another accumulation of adequate recovery of the enzymes .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly taken from the cycle and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were examined in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ent phase @-@ 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients have been recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients had been en@@ acted , the majority of patients were from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient referred to the heavy phen@@ otype . &quot;
&quot; patients have been recru@@ ited if they had a for@@ ci@@ ated exp@@ ir@@ ator volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and 5 meters . &quot;
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute secret stream in the 6 @-@ Min@@ ut@@ - o@@ test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label survey study where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated compared to the placebo group , an improvement in the lung function and o@@ conduc@@ tivity , presented in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the acceptance of the expected percentage of percentage . over this period clin@@ ically is not significant and the absolute lung @-@ volume increased propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
&quot; from 26 patients with a Hep@@ atom@@ izer , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size from the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a significant increase in the G@@ ag @-@ mirror in the har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was determined that remained constant up to the degree of study . &quot;
&quot; regarding the hetero@@ geneous path@@ ways between the patients , which sums up the clin@@ ically significant changes across across five hosts ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
&quot; it was conducted a one @-@ year @-@ year open phase 2 study , where mainly the security and phar@@ yn@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied at 20 patients ( 16 patients with severe round @-@ form and 4 with the medium course of course ) . &quot;
&quot; for four patients , the dosage was increased because of increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror in the Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg . &quot;
&quot; in several patients , a size of magnitude ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) has been determined after the Z @-@ Score for these age group ( &lt; 2,5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mid @-@ course form to determine only limited or even no progress in cognitive development . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , investigations into pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ Do@@ xi@@ schem@@ ata were carried out at the G@@ ag @-@ Spiegel in the har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walking test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every two weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks may be in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , a reasonable alternative . however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two doses is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug is actu@@ alized . &quot;
the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic profile among patients aged under 5 years was similar to those in older and less strongly affected patients .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on the security of security , toxicity in mal@@ ign@@ ant gift , toxicity in repeated gift and reproduction , the pre@@ clinical data cannot be recognized for humans . &quot;
&quot; since no ampli@@ fiers studies have been carried out , this medicine may not be mixed with other medicines , except with the ones listed under 6 . &quot;

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with Cis@@ pl@@ atin ( a different drug against cancer ) , which still has no chemotherapy ( drug against cancer ) , and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant cancer ) has already been removed or spreads easily to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ bourgeois &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the plate cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have previously not been treated earlier , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy as all therapy . &quot;
to decrease side effects should patients receive a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and injections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with Cis@@ pl@@ atin , should be given before or after the gift of Cis@@ pl@@ atin in addition an &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic &quot; ( drug against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent an fluid deficiency ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood image changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be pushed above , or the dose should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; the active form of pl@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed slo@@ ws down the formation of DNA and RNA , and prevents the cells divide . &quot;
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in its active form goes easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells which results in higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer period of time in cancer cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta was examined for treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oms in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy against their disease .
&quot; the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , which had previously been treated with chemotherapy in chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( a further drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin , passed on average 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months at all @-@ some administration of Cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients who previously received chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,@@ 3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , patients , in which cancer did not attack the plate cells , during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta extended survival times than with the comparison of comparison . &quot;
&quot; September 2004 , the European Commission adopted the El@@ i Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. , a permit for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union . &quot;
each passing bottle has to be applied with 4.@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a resolution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ - sis is taken from a bottle of bottle and cut with 0.@@ 9 % sodium injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) on 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is displayed in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin on first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ adhesive bronze ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ toxic bron@@ chi@@ al cardi@@ ac ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² - space ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of Cis@@ pl@@ atin amounts to 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small cell bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma according to previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduction the frequency and severity of skin , must be given the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift , as well as on the day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid are given . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days prior to the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses must be taken fo@@ lic acid and the intake must be continued during the entire therapy sessions as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate dose . &quot;
patients also need to receive an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ gram ) during the week before the first pin @-@ fixed dose as well as after each third term .
&quot; in patients who received P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should have created a complete blood @-@ screen before each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a thy@@ ism . &quot;
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ ates ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate Trans@@ am@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ G@@ OT ) and Alan@@ in @-@ Trans@@ am@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be &lt; 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit value . &quot;
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle a tin @-@ examination must take place under m@@ ück@@ ing the n@@ adi@@ rs of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity of the previous therapy cycles .
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applicable to AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy , or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute common C@@ rit@@ eria ( CT@@ C v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ CT@@ C degree 2 blood .
&quot; should patients not develop @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be interrupted , until the patient has the value before the treatment . &quot;
treatment with AL@@ WA@@ TA must be dis@@ continued when patients after 2 Dos@@ is@@ tive toxicity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity grade 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continued at the appearance of degree 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 years of age or in comparison to patients aged 65 years an increased side effects .
AL@@ WA@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to non @-@ sufficient data for im@@ mortality and efficacy .
clinical trials were necessary in patients with a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min no Dos@@ is@@ able adap@@ tations that go beyond the recommended Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations for all patients .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver functioning of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the top B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - bor@@ dering and / or trans@@ am@@ in@@ as@@ en@@ values of &gt; the 3,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metastatic cancer ) were not tested specifically in the studies . &quot;
patients must be supervised with regard to the button mark@@ marking and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be administered to patients before their absolute neutr@@ ons has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ - cylin@@ ders once again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a tin @-@ reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ any number , Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ zy@@ ten@@ te and maximum non @-@ hem@@ atology toxicity , as observed in previous treatment cycles - ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; reduced toxicity and a reduction of degree 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ at@@ mat@@ ology such as ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was be@@ amed if a pre @-@ line treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients need to be instruc@@ ted with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a prophy@@ l@@ actic measure for reduction treatment of toxicity ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to low kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non @-@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , in the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - TE@@ NS 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; all patients , for which a therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is intended to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ time treatment for at least 5 days before the therapy , in the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients , in which these events occurred , had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including stretching de@@ hydr@@ ation , pres@@ active high blood pressure or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid liquid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular area , a dra@@ inage of the ergometer should be wei@@ ghed against before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment . &quot;
&quot; 5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ d@@ gling , and zer@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events have been reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this substance is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application atten@@ u@@ ated vital substance ( except yellow fever , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of an irre@@ versi@@ bly skull is made by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the treatment - g@@ inn@@ y should be pointed out to consult with regards to the sper@@ mat@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses can non @-@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1 day a day ) , to a decreased penetration of side @-@ effects . &quot;
&quot; therefore , caution is advisable when in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid can be used in high doses . &quot;

&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are te@@ dious spots along the After , Fl@@ atus ( Win@@ de ) with stu@@ d@@ ging , fa@@ eces ( f@@ oul ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( Win@@ de ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it must not be used in patients who are treated with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent the organ @-@ proof at transplan@@ ts ) or with drugs like War@@ far@@ in to prevent cl@@ ots of blood cl@@ ots .
it must also not be used in patients who suffer from a long @-@ term mal@@ absor@@ bing syndrome ( which do not suffer enough nutrients from the digestive tract ) or to chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver illness ) or pregnant mothers .
July 2007 the European Commission announced the European Commission G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited to adopt Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
alli made for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with an easily hypo@@ cal@@ orie .
&quot; alli made use of children and young people under the age of 18 , as not enough data on efficacy and security exist . &quot;
&quot; however , since Or@@ list@@ at is only minimal and absorbed among elders and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function , no adjustment of dosage is necessary . &quot;
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or one of the other components • simultaneous treatment with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.6 ) • Chron@@ icle ( see section 4.6 ) • Integr@@ ated treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ als anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of the more gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if alli is taken together with a low @-@ fat meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied with improved metabolic control , patients should consult a medicine against diabetes before starting a therapy with a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic needs must be adjusted if necessary . &quot;
patients who have made alli gains as well as medicines for high blood pressure or higher cholesterol levels should consult their physician or pharmac@@ ists whether the dosage of these medicines must be adjusted .
&quot; it is recommended to meet additional fluctu@@ ating measures , in order to prevent the possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
both in a study on interactions of pharmaceuticals as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of Or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed a de@@ ple@@ tion of the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in plastic bar .
&quot; when using war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with Or@@ list@@ at could be influenced by the Quick @-@ values ( international normal , rati@@ o , IN@@ R ) ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for most patients , which were treated in clinical studies up to 4 full years with Or@@ list@@ at , the concentrations of the vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta @-@ carot@@ enes in the standardization sector remained . &quot;
&quot; however , the patients should be recommended before bed@@ time to take a supple@@ mental mul@@ tiv@@ itamin supplement to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the gift of a single @-@ mal@@ dose Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ one was observed at a limited number of volunteers , who at the same time got Or@@ list@@ at , a slightly decrease in the Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; veterinary studies showed no direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug , as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented . &quot;
the gastro@@ intestinal effects were obtained from clinical trials with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
&quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not invaluable ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of those who were determined after the launch of Or@@ list@@ at is not known , as these events voluntarily were reported from a population of un@@ certain size . &quot;
. it is plau@@ sible that the treatment with alli gains in terms of possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects can lead .
&quot; individual cans of 800 mg Or@@ list@@ at and multi @-@ user sources of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered for a period of 15 days to norm@@ alized , overweight and overweight subjects , without any significant clinical findings . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of the reported cases reported by Or@@ list@@ at over@@ do@@ zation , either side @-@ side effects or similar side effects were reported in the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on investigations on humans and animals , it can be traced by a rapid re@@ formation of systemic systemic effects that are attributable to the li@@ tigation properties of Or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
the therapeutic effect continues in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by kov@@ al@@ ente to the active Ser@@ in @-@ Rest of the ga@@ str@@ al and Pan@@ cre@@ atic Li@@ pas@@ es .
&quot; clinical studies has been derived , that 60 mg Or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fet@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ized , plac@@ eb@@ controlled studies on adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 shows the effectiveness of 60 mg Or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with an hypo@@ cal@@ orie , fet@@ ched diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameters , the variation of the weight loss compared to the output value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) , has been rated as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of course ( table 1 ) and as a percentage of those courses that have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their output weight ( table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction has been observed over 12 months , the largest weight loss in the first 6 months occurred . &quot;
the average change in the overall cholester@@ in was with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( output value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.@@ 8 % ( output value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
the average change in the L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols was with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg - 3.5 % ( output value 3,@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( output value 3,@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at the wa@@ ist size the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( output value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.@@ 6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3,5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of not metabolic organ at 8 hours after the oral gift of 360 mg Or@@ list@@ at were not measurable ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , at therapeutic doses could not be metabo@@ li@@ zed in the plasma only spor@@ adic@@ ally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.0@@ 2 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of a grief . &quot;

BM@@ I helps you determine if you have a normal weight in relation to your body size or are overweight .
&quot; even if these diseases first do not cause you to feel uncomfortable , you should nonetheless ask your doctor to check a check@@ up . &quot;
&quot; for each 2 kg body weight , which you can decrease in the frame of a diet , you can lose an additional kilo@@ gram with the help of alli . &quot;

&quot; if you leave a meal or contains a meal no fat , do not take any capsule . alli can only work when the food fat contains . &quot;
&quot; when you take the capsule in connection with a meal , which contains too much fat , risk @-@ conditional esc@@ ort ( see section 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; to get used to your body to the new eating habits , you begin already before the first capsule with a cal@@ ory and fet@@ ched diet . &quot;
&quot; dietary supplements are effective as you can track at any time , what you eat , how much you eat and it will probably be easier to change your diet habits . &quot;
&quot; to achieve your target weight , you should set in advance two daily goals : one for the calories and one for fat . &quot;
&quot; • Food out sc@@ ou@@ sted to reduce the likelihood of nutritional supplements ( see Section 4 ) . • Imag@@ ining , to move more before you start taking the capsules . &quot;
remember to ask your doctor in advance if you are not used physical activity . • St@@ ay you during the intake and also after finishing the intake of alli physically active .
&quot; • alli is not allowed to be taken longer than six months . • If you can notice no reduction in your weight after twelve weeks , please ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice . &quot;
&quot; under circumstances , you must finish the intake of alli made . • In a successful reduction of weight it is not about to switch to diet and return to old habits . &quot;
&quot; • If less than an hour has passed since the last meal , take the intake of the capsule after . • If more than an hour has passed since the last meal , do not take any capsule . &quot;

the most common side @-@ effects depend on the way of capsules along and thereby arises that more fat is out of the body .
&quot; these side @-@ effects usually occur within the first weeks after treatment begins , as you might not have reduced the amount of fat in the diet during this time . &quot;
&quot; with the following basic rules you can learn to minim@@ ise the nutritional companions : • You already have some days , or better a week , prior to taking the capsules with a fet@@ ching diet . • Learning more about the usual fat content of your favourite food and about the size of portions that you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the likelihood you can exceed your fat limit . • Do your recommended fat is even@@ ly mounted on the daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of a high @-@ fat peak , or a timely after@@ math , as you may have done it in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people in which these companions occur to control them with time in adaptation of their diets . &quot;
&quot; • medications to protect children from in@@ accessible . • You are not allowed to store the content from moisture to the content of moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with sili@@ cone gel , which serve to keep the capsules dry . &quot;

energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ le that you also find as indication of the packaging of food . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day .
note the further down in this section below . • The recommended fet@@ ters used in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
&quot; which quantity for you is suitable , take the lower information , which is the number of calories you are suitable for you . • Due to the size of the capsule is the observ@@ ance of the recommended fet@@ ters is crucial . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; due to the recommended fet@@ ters , you can maximize the weight loss and at the same time reduce the likelihood of nutritional components . • You should try to gradually increase gradually . &quot;
&quot; 34 These decreased cal@@ orie intake should allow you to gradually lose weight of approximately 0,5 kg per week without frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; low physical activity &quot; means that you are forced to work daily only little or not , e.g. through 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute gardening or 2 km of running in 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; • For a lasting weight reduction , it is necessary to set up realistic cal@@ ory and li@@ posu@@ ction targets and to adhere them also . • useful is a nutritional book with information about cal@@ ory and fat content of your meals . • Imag@@ ining to move more before starting with the intake of alli . &quot;
&quot; the alli program for supporting weight reduction combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information material , which can help you feed , cal@@ ori@@ ze and fet@@ ches and provide guidelines to become physically active . &quot;
&quot; in conjunction with a tailored program to support the weight delivery , you can help you develop this information to develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chemotherapy which are strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like Cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ a , which are moderate trig@@ gering for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a drug can be used as anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic ) .
the use of patients under the age of 18 is not recommended as to the effects in this age group there is not enough information available .
&quot; this means that the substance is known to a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ in ( 5@@ HT , even as ser@@ otonin ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine . &quot;
Alo@@ xi was investigated in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy reg@@ imen which are powerful or moderate trig@@ gering for nausea and vom@@ iting .
&quot; in chemotherapy , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting are 59 % of the patients who were treated with alo@@ xi ( 132 from 2@@ 23 ) compared to 57 % of patients with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chemotherapy which are moderate trig@@ gering for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients showed , in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 15@@ 3 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ on these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ on ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 the European Commission commissioned the company Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd . a permit to the event of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : to the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting at strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer disease and the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting at moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting that is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be reinforced by adding a prior to chemotherapy given cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids .
&quot; as Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on can prolong the col@@ on , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ nesty Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or sign of a subtle I@@ le@@ us after the injection . &quot;
&quot; as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 Ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , caution is advisable in the simultaneous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on with drugs that prolon@@ gs the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ t interval is extended or which tend to be such an extension . &quot;
&quot; except in connection with another chem@@ ist gift , Alo@@ xi should not be used for preventing nausea and vom@@ iting for the treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on inhibit@@ ors the five examined activity of the five examined chemotherapy agents ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ or , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) . &quot;
in a clinical study no significant pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on and a ste@@ ady - concentration of met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , of a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in one of a population based pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( Ami@@ o@@ chi@@ an , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ ine , C@@ im@@ mobili@@ zer , ch@@ ox@@ ic@@ ine , ch@@ ic@@ alin and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on . &quot;
&quot; experience to use Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on in human gest@@ ures are not before , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on should not be applied in pregnant women , unless it is necessary to treat the doctor as necessary . &quot;
clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observe side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) who were at least possibly with alo@@ xi in connection to head@@ ache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity and reactions to the end of fulfillment ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were stated in post @-@ marketing reviews . &quot;
in the group with the highest dosage showed similar frequencies of undes@@ irable events as in the other doses ; there were no dose to be observed .
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis probably is not an effective therapy for alo@@ xi@@ an over@@ do@@ zation . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ized double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1.@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with &lt; 50 mg / m2 al@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 micro@@ grams or 750 micro@@ gram Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 7,@@ 3 hours ) or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ on ( half @-@ time 7,@@ 3 hours ) received intraven@@ ously on day 1 without D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients , which received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ or and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ dic@@ ine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ gram Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on , who received 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron , which was given to day 1 intraven@@ ously . &quot;
results of the studies with moderate @-@ based chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical studies on indicator of chemotherapy induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on blood pressure , heart rate and E@@ KG parameters , including the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron and Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on . &quot;
according to the naming of pre @-@ clinical studies Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on has the ability to block the i@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ pol@@ arization of the I@@ on@@ en@@ channels and to extend the duration of the action potential .
&quot; the aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the E@@ KG effects of i.@@ v. administered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on in single d@@ ots of 0.@@ 25 , 0,@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg . &quot;
Res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous gift follows a initial decline of plasma concentrations a slow Eli@@ mination of the body with an average duration of half @-@ time of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentrations @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the entire dosage area of 0.@@ 3@@ - 90 μ g / kg in vocal and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous gift from Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average ( ± SD ) was measured between day 1 and day 5 measured medium ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; from pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , the total duration reached from 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on to 3 consecutive days reached in total tex@@ position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with which after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration reached by 0,@@ 75 mg higher . &quot;
&quot; about 40 % are eliminated over the kidneys , and approximately another 50 % are converted into two primary Met@@ abol@@ ites , which are compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on over less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor . &quot;
in @-@ vit@@ ro studies for Met@@ abol@@ isation have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , on a limited extent , the I@@ so@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 am involved in Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on . &quot;
&quot; Eli@@ mination After a intraven@@ ous individual dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on were found about 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on as un@@ changing substance made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a unique intraven@@ ous bol@@ ster object , the total of the body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although in patients with severe liver therapy the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ al acid , and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on increases , a reduction in the dose is therefore not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered sufficiently above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relevance to the clinical use . &quot;
10 out of pre@@ clinical trials took note that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on can only block in very high concentrations of I@@ on@@ en@@ channels that are involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ pol@@ arization and can prolong the stock@@ holders .
&quot; high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on ( each dose spoke in about the 30@@ 3 of the therapeutic exposure in humans ) who were given daily over two years , led to a multip@@ ly incidence of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine , pancre@@ as , tri@@ bul@@ ae , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al glands and skin tum@@ ours on rats , but not on mice . &quot;

&quot; June 2006 , the Committee on Human Physi@@ cs ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the ren@@ unciation of the drug for the treatment of hepatitis C is recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon is a biological medicine named Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medical and effective component , which has already been approved in the EU ( also &quot; &quot; reference rating &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ prolonged ) hepatitis C ( one by a viral infection ) .
&quot; at a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic examination , the liver tissue causes damage to , in addition , the values of the liver en@@ vy of Alan@@ in@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) is increased in the blood . &quot;
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of the active ingredient .
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon submitted data prior to the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active structure , composition and purity of the drug , an estimated , safety and effectiveness in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
in the study of patients with hepatitis C the effectiveness of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to the effectiveness of the reference phar@@ ma via 4@@ 55 patients .
&quot; the study was measured , as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment sessions as well as six months after setting the treatment to the drug ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood has been reported ) . &quot;

&quot; furthermore , concerns have expressed concern that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug are not sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C , which spoke to treatment with al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study . &quot;
&quot; after setting the treatment with al@@ ph@@ eon fl@@ amm@@ te the disease at more patients will be back on than with the reference certificate ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the test was conducted in the study to investigate the question , to which far the drug forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
it can be applied to the treatment of Im@@ peti@@ go ( one with cr@@ ust formation of @-@ going skin infection ) and small in@@ fic@@ ated Laz@@ er@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ - or cutting ) , me@@ ager and paraly@@ zed wounds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go is not intended to treat infections that have been det@@ ectable or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ fi@@ ente for@@ res@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because aler@@ go against this kind of infections may not affect .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients aged nine months , but patients under the age of 18 must not be able to treat skin surface more than 2 % of the body &apos;s surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient is not addressed two to three days , the doctor should study the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial cast@@ es ( the parts of the bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ elle where proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was dis@@ car@@ ded after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.@@ 1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo spoke to the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected Hau@@ tw@@ unden , Al@@ tar@@ go and Cef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar points of contact : if the results of both studies were put together at Hau@@ tw@@ unden , about 90 % of patients were involved in the treatment of both groups . &quot;
&quot; in these two studies , however , that Al@@ tar@@ go was found in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( whi@@ p @-@ filled cav@@ ity in the body tissue ) or of infections that have been det@@ ectable or presumably by MR@@ SA is not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed from 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irritation at the Principal .
the Committee on Human Physi@@ cs ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of al@@ tar@@ go to weigh in the short @-@ time treatment of the following superficial skin infections in comparison to the risks : • Im@@ peti@@ go , • in@@ scri@@ bed small lazy , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; may 2007 , the European Commission announced the European Commission G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a permit to the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go to the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; patients , in which two or three days not show an improvement , should be investigated once more and an alternative therapy ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the event of raising or heavy local irritation , the treatment is broken down by the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ine , the sal@@ ine should be carefully de@@ fici@@ ent and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection began . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not intended to treat infections where MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gens or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials of secondary wounds was the effectiveness of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections , which were caused by a meth@@ ade @-@ resistant st@@ hy@@ lo@@ cocc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , insufficient . &quot;
an alternative treatment should be considered if after a 2- to 3 @-@ day treatment will not happen any improvement or worsen@@ ing of the infected item .
the impact of the simultaneous application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical resources on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentrations , which have been achieved by humans according to topical skin or infected superficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition will not be expected in vi@@ vo ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 After simultaneous gift from 2 times a day 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol elevated the middle re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Au@@ c ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max to top@@ ischer application of 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on de@@ ported skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations are not required for if topical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive @-@ production after oral intake and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and the federal / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ine should be used only during pregnancy if a topical anti @-@ bacterial therapy is clearly indic@@ ative and the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to deal with the gift of a systemic antibiotic .
when deciding whether the breastfeeding continues / termin@@ ated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continues to be completed between the benefit of breastfeeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
&quot; clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was used , the most commonly reported side @-@ effect irritation at the end of the end , which considered about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; it is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by Fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly P@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the effect mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective in@@ hibition of bacterial prot@@ ein@@ synthesis by interaction at a particular bin@@ der point of the bacterial str@@ bos@@ oms which differs from the bin@@ ds of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial fabrics .
data point out that the B@@ use point ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ Bin@@ ding centre and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ral centre .
&quot; through li@@ aison at this binary point P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line den Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , block partial P @-@ bin@@ der interactions and prevent the normal education of active 50@@ s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; if the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should be reflec@@ tive to the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin , at least some infection forms , a consultation should be pursued by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ aur@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ysts . &quot;
&quot; in the case of failure to treatment at S.@@ aur@@ ur@@ us , the presence of tribes should be considered with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) . &quot;
Res@@ or@@ ption In a study involving healthy adults has been rated 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ine a day under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ine twice daily for 5 days to the topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual sculpture were obtained . &quot;
the sampling took place on the days 3 or 4 in adult patients in front of the mediation and children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual system admission to the people after topical application of 1 % sal@@ be on 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; Au@@ c ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 @-@ times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP Hem@@ p . &quot;

&quot; in studies on oral toxicity to rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;

&quot; there was neither male nor female genital signs of reduced fertility at oral doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , whereby one up to 5 times higher exposure has been reached as the highest valued exposure to humans ( top@@ an application on 200 c@@ m2 . &quot;
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats were detected at oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 @-@ times of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) to development sto@@ x@@ ic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ern@@ ale toxicity .

Ambi@@ rix applies to protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases which affect the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years that are not im@@ mu@@ te against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix will be applied within the framework of one of two doses existing vaccines , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix must only be used when the immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and it is ensured that the vaccine can be managed from two doses . &quot;
if a refres@@ her dose is desired against hepatitis A or B can be Ambi@@ rix or another Hepatitis A or B vaccine .
&quot; vaccines have an effect on bringing the immune system ( the natural resistance of the body ) , &quot; how it can rise up against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognises the viruses and surface anti@@ gens than &quot; foreign &quot; and generates antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the approved vaccine Twin@@ rix adult and the approved vaccine Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
&quot; the three vaccines are used to protect the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adult and Twin@@ rix children are administered within the framework of one out of three doses . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix contain identical ingredients , some of the data , which support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also as proof of the use of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the percentage of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection a protective antibody concentrations .
in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with six months and a 12 @-@ month interval between the two injections .
Ambi@@ rix resulted in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection from ambient at a six @-@ month interval between the injections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in over 1 of 10 vaccine ) are head@@ ache , pain in the injection site , redness , mat@@ iness , and irrit@@ ability . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix may react to patients who may possibly super@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients one of the other components or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) will not be applied .
August 2002 joined the European Commission to the G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als s.@@ a. a permit for the transport of Ambi@@ rix in the whole
&quot; the Stand@@ ardi@@ zation plan for pri@@ di@@ mm@@ ation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vaccines , whereby the first dose is administered after the election and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her can be desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vaccines or with a combination @-@ simple vaccine . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis C anti @-@ hepatitis C anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vaccines .
&quot; it is not yet completely secured , whether immune persons addressed to an hepatitis A@@ - vaccine , a refres@@ her can be protected as protection , as they are also protected with no longer det@@ ectable antibodies by the immun@@ ological memory . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all injections , should be available immediately for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the gift of the vaccine appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and supervision . &quot;
&quot; if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the Stand@@ ardi@@ mp scheme is recommended with the combination @-@ simple , the 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis C virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able Hepatitis B surface finishes . &quot;
&quot; in case of here@@ tic patients and persons with mal@@ functions of the immune system , there is no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibody therapeu@@ tically , so in these cases the Gift of additional vacc@@ inations can be required . &quot;
&quot; since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tra @-@ muscular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ ure results , these injections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; however , with Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ zy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or blood cl@@ ots , Ambi@@ rix can be in@@ ject in@@ compar@@ ably sub@@ cut@@ aneous as it can occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift to bleeding . &quot;

&quot; in patients under immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ aults , it has to be assumed that potentially no adequate immune response is achieved . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study that has been carried out with 3 vacc@@ inations of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ch@@ iness , headaches and fever comparable to the frequency , which was observed in the earlier Thi@@ omer@@ ang and preserv@@ ative vaccine formulation . &quot;
in clinical trials 20 29 vaccines have been administered at a total of 10@@ 27 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
&quot; in a study of 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ doses of combination . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and effects on a basis basis per vaccine basis , however , not on a basis basis per person . &quot;
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the subjects compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the pros after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ doses combination .
&quot; after the complete vaccine cycle reported 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects , the Ambi@@ rix had given sufficient , over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % for the subjects associated with the 3 @-@ Dos@@ age combination . &quot;
&quot; however , the incidence of mat@@ iness was comparable high ( i.e. over the whole vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects , the Ambi@@ rix got , compared to 3@@ 6.@@ 2 % with the subjects that received the 3 @-@ doses of combination ) . &quot;
the incidence of superior pain and matri@@ mon@@ ity was small and comparable to that after administration of the combination @-@ simple vaccine has been observed with the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ inations .
in a comparative study of 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year vacc@@ inations was the appearance of local actions and general public transactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group comparable to that in administration with the 3 @-@ doses of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis C virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able Hepatitis B surface finishes .
&quot; at the 6@@ - to 11@@ - year @-@ old , however , after vaccination with Ambi@@ rix , it was a common occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band . &quot;
the percentage of vacc@@ inations available over severe effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine with the combination @-@ simple hepatitis C virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able Hepatitis B@@ - surface finishes , was not statisti@@ cally different . &quot;

&quot; the immune response , which have been reached in a clinical comparison study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old a month after completion of the full vaccine series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ doses vaccines with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA units formal hepatitis C virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able Hepatitis B surface .
&quot; for individuals who were at the time of the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ ation between 12 and 15 years old , the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 month of vaccine . &quot;
&quot; the immune response reaction against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that , based on vaccination of 3 cans with a combination simple , consisting of 360 ELISA units , form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B systems and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able hepatitis B surface in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml . &quot;
in a clinical trial at 12@@ - up to 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be demonstrated that the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies 24 months after immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6@@ - months @-@ vacc@@ ema comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vaccination scheme .

&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a blonde face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yellow ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vaccines , Ambi@@ rix cannot protect entirely from infection with hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccine series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your Child are infected before the administration of both vaccines and is infected with hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B virus ( although you / Your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill / feel ) vaccination may not prevent disease .
protection against other infections that are causing the liver or symptoms which are similar to those according to hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B infection cannot be conve@@ yed .
• If you have an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express themselves through it@@ chy @-@ set@@ backs , breathing problems or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you / your child has performed an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccine against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever . &quot;
• If you want to quickly have protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the scheduled administration of the second vacc@@ inations ) .
&quot; with a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccine with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
instead he will recommend you / your Child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis A@@ - / Hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased content to effective components of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B @-@ surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ inations of this vaccine with decreased content to effective components is usually administered a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccine against your child at the end of the vaccine .
&quot; sometimes , Ambi@@ rix will suffer from people who suffer from serious blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not in the muscle inj@@ ected . if you / your child is weak@@ ened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s body , or if you / your Child moves to a tick @-@ cataly@@ se . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases but the immune response of these persons on vaccine cannot be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is .
21 sa@@ ws to your doctor if you / your child take further medicines / take ( including those that you have been received without prescri@@ bing ) or if you / your child have recently been vacc@@ inated / has been given or immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibodies ) received / has or this is planned in the near future .
but it can be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
&quot; if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different limbs . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , ambient or breastfeeding women is not administered unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B . &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please tell your doctor if you have shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) in your child .
&quot; if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; often ( more than 1 case per 10 exp@@ ired cans ) : • pain or discomfort at the inser@@ tion point or redness • mat@@ uring • stimul@@ ant • head@@ ache • appetite deficiency . &quot;
&quot; often ( up to 1 case per 10 exp@@ ired cans ) : • swelling at the injection site • fever ( more than 38 ° C ) • Ben@@ om@@ men@@ ence • gastro@@ intestinal ail@@ ments , &quot;
&quot; other side effects , which were reported days or weeks after vaccination with comparable com@@ ation or individual substances against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 dec@@ imal cans ) are reported : &quot;
&quot; these com@@ prise limited or expan@@ sive set@@ backs , which can be or blows to ju@@ cken , swelling of the eye parts and the face , complicated breathing or lo@@ ops , sudden blood pressure and consci@@ ous@@ y . &quot;

&quot; based on the data , which has been known since the first approval for the in@@ filtration , the CH@@ MP thinks that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix is positive . &quot;
&quot; however , there is only limited traffic in one member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure . &quot;
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients aged over a month using in@@ complete en@@ ym@@ atic defect ( brain damage as a result of high br@@ am@@ mon@@ ium concentrations ) in the pre @-@ history .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps is divided - split up to several individual cans among meals - swal@@ lowed , among the food mixed or via a gastro@@ scopy ( through the abdom@@ en in the stomach of leading hose ) or a nose ( through the nose in the stomach of leading hose ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study , since Am@@ mon@@ aps will not be compared with any other treatment or with placebo ( a hypo@@ cr@@ o medicine , i.e. without active ingredient ) . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps also can lead to loss of loss , loss of acid , headaches , irritation , headaches , impotence or taste , pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , un@@ even@@ ly body odor or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee on Human Physi@@ cs ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Am@@ mon@@ aps in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle may be effectively prevented .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps has been authorized under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; because of the r@@ arity of the condition at the time of admission , only limited information on this medicine is available . &quot;
&quot; the use is indic@@ ative in all patients , where a complete duck deficiency has already manifested in the newborn child ( within the first 28 days of life ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ feste form ( in@@ complete en@@ ym@@ atic defect , which is manifest after the first CV ) , then there is an indication for the use when in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese is a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary encephal@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with slip disorders , AM@@ MONA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form . &quot;
the daily dose will be calculated individually by taking into account the protein intolerance and for the growth and development of all daily protein intake .
&quot; according to recent clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; for patients suffering from an early manic@@ ure lack of car@@ b@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the substitution of Cit@@ qu@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
patients with a arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ app@@ ucc@@ ine deficiency must be arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with slip disorders , as a risk for the emergence of an oil hag@@ us , when the tablets are not immediately moving into the stomach . &quot;
every tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at that corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure and with sodium and educational background only with caution .
&quot; since Met@@ abol@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ at over the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should be applied to patients with liver or kidney failure , only with extreme caution . &quot;
the significance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous Gift of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate at young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) it came to a slo@@ wing of the neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and to a gest@@ ed loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a hesit@@ ated mat@@ uring of cerebral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be noted whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ased by humans into the mother &apos;s milk and for that reason the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS , at 56 % of patients stood at least one unwanted event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these undes@@ irable events , it was assumed that they did not connect to AM@@ MONA@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a probable @-@ toxic response to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old anor@@ mal patient , which developed a metabolic encephal@@ opathy in connection with Lac@@ to@@ azi@@ k@@ ebo@@ x , he@@ avier hypo@@ neu@@ rop@@ es , peripher@@ y N@@ europ@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; a case of an over@@ dose came with a 5 @-@ month old baby , with a accidentally single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound linked by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that is out of the kidneys .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ ometric is comparable to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea comparable ( both connections contain 2 nit@@ rogen ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nit@@ rogen .
5 patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ure@@ tic cycle may be assumed that for each gram Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen . &quot;
&quot; it is of importance that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately , in order to improve survival and clinical results . &quot;
&quot; the prognosis of the earliest shape of the condition with the appearance of the first symptoms in the newborn old was almost always inf@@ ant , and the disease itself led to death with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their sti@@ cking @-@ free an@@ alo@@ ga within the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; by Hem@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis , the exploitation of alternative ways of nit@@ ric acet@@ ate ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ ate , sodium t@@ zo@@ at and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , sodium and perhaps substitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rates of post@@ part@@ ements in post@@ part@@ al ( however , within the first CV ) diagnostic conditions to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients , it was time with many other intellectual disabilities or other neurological deficits . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ wearing shape of the condition ( including feminine patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ out form of or@@ ni@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ y encephal@@ opathy and then permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a prot@@ ein@@ ated diet , was the survival rate 98 % . &quot;
already existing neurological deficits are also hardly rever@@ sible and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is preserv@@ ated in liver and kidney acid with glut@@ amine , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is created . &quot;
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its Met@@ abol@@ ites in plasma and urine have been determined according to gift of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at with so@@ ber healthy adult and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis according to individual loan and repeated gifts of oral doses from up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its Met@@ abol@@ ites was also investigated in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous use of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an or@@ ical dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form were determined 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ nit@@ rogen distur@@ ban@@ ces or hem@@ ost@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies after different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning after noc@@ tur@@ nal fasting no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma det@@ ectable .
&quot; in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis that were repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three individual cans ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plastic bar on the third day are five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medicine is retired within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of con@@ ju@@ gi@@ ted product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine via the kidneys .
&quot; according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at with toxic and non @-@ toxic cans , rats had no cl@@ ast@@ o@@ genic effects ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2@@ 800 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules becomes either oral ( inf@@ ant and children who have not swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with lo@@ ops ) or over a host ro@@ stom@@ a or nas@@ al no@@ vices . &quot;
&quot; according to recent clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um@@ prot@@ eine in plasma should be held within the normal range . &quot;
&quot; for patients suffering from an early manic@@ ure lack of car@@ b@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the substitution of Cit@@ qu@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
if rat @-@ feder@@ ate before birth phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ lit by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ) were exposed to lesi@@ ons in the pyramid cells of the brain rin@@ ses .
&quot; a probable @-@ toxic response to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old anor@@ mal patient , which developed a metabolic encephal@@ opathy in connection with Lac@@ to@@ azi@@ k@@ ebo@@ x , he@@ avier hypo@@ neu@@ rop@@ es , peripher@@ y N@@ europ@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ ometric is comparable to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea comparable ( both connections contain 2 nit@@ rogen ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess weight .
based on investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ure@@ tic cycle may be assumed that for each gram Nat@@ al phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can be produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen . &quot;
&quot; already existing neurological deficits are hardly rever@@ sible , and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition . &quot;
after an or@@ ical dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form were determined 15 minutes after the intake of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; with this procedure , the small measuring spo@@ on 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring spo@@ on 2,@@ 9 g and the large measurement of 8,@@ 6 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
if a patient needs to get the medication via a Son@@ de can be dissolved AM@@ MONA@@ PS before the use even in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
&quot; patients with these rare diseases are missing certain liver enzymes , so they can dis@@ car@@ ve the sti@@ cking waste products that accum@@ ulate after consumption of proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if you are done with laboratory studies , you need to tell the doctor that you will use AM@@ MONA@@ PS , as Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can affect the results of certain laboratory studies . &quot;
&quot; when taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period , you may not take AM@@ MONA@@ PS because the medicine could move into the mother &apos;s milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases also confusion , headaches , taste disorders , indul@@ gence of hearing , dis@@ oriented , memory disorders and a deterioration of existing neurological conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you determine one of these symptoms , consult immediately with your doctor or using the emergency intake of your hospital for the purpose of appropriate treatment . &quot;

&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , decreased blood sugar to the heart ) , for example with inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ d@@ attack ( heart attack ) without &quot; &quot; ST@@ ILL &quot; &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measurement at electro@@ cardi@@ o@@ gram or E@@ KG ) . &quot;
&quot; if An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to the prevention of blood cl@@ auses in patients , which is applied to a PC@@ I , a higher dose can be administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help in patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PC@@ I .
&quot; nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox at all some gift ( GP@@ I , another medicine to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination @-@ line treatment with He@@ et@@ in ( another anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and an GP@@ I was compared . &quot;
&quot; during the PC@@ I the patients frequently became a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the Ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , and they also received other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart failure or re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year altogether as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who subjected to a PC@@ I , An@@ gi@@ ox was just as effective as ha@@ par@@ in , except for heavy bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than ha@@ par@@ in . &quot;
angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be sur@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , other deer , or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it must also not be used in patients who recently had a blood , as well as with people with heavy hypertension or severe kidney problems or heart infection . &quot;
the Committee on Human Physi@@ cs ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is used in the treatment of ACS and during a PC@@ I a remov@@ able replacement for Hit@@ par@@ in .
&quot; September 2004 , the European Commission announced the European Commission The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd received approval for the transfer of angi@@ ox across the European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute anxiety / non @-@ leverage assault ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) for an emergency attack or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bol@@ ding of 0.@@ 1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if the patient is carried out a PC@@ I in further sequence , an additional bolt should be increased from 0.5 mg / kg and increases in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; after PC@@ I , according to clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be added for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately prior to the procedure , a shaft of 0.5 mg / kg is administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation . &quot;
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PC@@ I consists of a initi@@ als intraven@@ ous bol@@ ding of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a loss directly subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single Bol@@ us Gift of An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PC@@ I procedure is planned .
&quot; this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) shortened to under 225 seconds , should be a second round of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the appearance of low ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ ent and dil@@ uted medicines should be carefully mixed before the application and the bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis will be administered quickly intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT amounts more than 225 seconds , another surveillance is no longer required , provided that 1.@@ 75 mg / kg In@@ fusion dose is administered correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney functionality ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PC@@ I ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; the ACT value is under 225 seconds , is a second bol@@ ted dose of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second shaft dose to test again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney disease , which led in the phase II@@ I@@ - PC@@ I study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT lay 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment , on average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients is An@@ gi@@ ox contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be carried out 30 minutes after termination of intraven@@ ous use of un@@ questionable he@@ als or 8 hours after ending the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift from lower molecular hegemon@@ y .
• well @-@ known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other components or against brain disorders due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of hem@@ ost@@ asis and / or irre@@ versi@@ bly cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders . • severe kidney disease ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding especially when bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even if in PC@@ I patients , most blood@@ ches occur in arter@@ ial points , can occur in patients suffering from a cut@@ aneous coron@@ ary military intervention ( PC@@ I ) during the treatment in principle all bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in patients , those waiting in and with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine should be considered to ensure that the value of the IN@@ R ( International standardization ) should be considered once again , before the treatment achieved existing level . &quot;
&quot; starting from the knowledge of the active mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ów@@ ko ) , it can be assumed that these active substances increase the blood danger . &quot;

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , juven@@ iles and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( among the skin ) into the abdom@@ inal wall , inj@@ ected the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm or as permanent in@@ fusion with a insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not have enough insulin in regulating the glucose epitheli@@ um ( sugar ) in the blood or may not process the insulin .
&quot; insulin is quite different from human resources , and the change means that it works faster and a shorter period of time has as a short @-@ effective human . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a slow insulin treatment in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between 4 and 17 years .
&quot; type 2 diabetes , where the body of insulin is not able to work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was investigated in a study of 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the change of concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ li@@ fied hem@@ ost@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin .
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.0@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human standard . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be used in patients who may be sur@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against insulin or any of the other components or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra need to be adjusted when it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose level .
&quot; September 2004 , the European Commission announced the European Commission San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ enti@@ s Deutschland GmbH with approval for the in@@ filtration of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is known as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , either in the area of the abdom@@ en , the torso or the del@@ usion or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdom@@ en . &quot;
&quot; due to the decreased gluten @-@ homogen@@ ous capacity and the dimin@@ ished insulin @-@ free insulin , the insulin needs to be down in patients with a limitation of liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the active strength , the brand ( her@@ - St@@ eller ) , of insulin @-@ type ( normal , N@@ PH , galvan@@ izing etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method can draw a change of insulin delivery . &quot;
&quot; 3 An insufficient dosage or the outbreak of a treatment , particularly in patients with an ins@@ isting diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ ac@@ osis ; these conditions are potentially threatening . &quot;
changing a patient to another insulin or insulin or insulin in another manufacturer should take place under strict physician supervision and can make a change of dosage required .
&quot; the timing of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the real profile of the insulin , and can therefore change when switching to the treatment schem@@ as . &quot;
&quot; to the substances that increase the blood@@ sugar activity and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic acid , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ y@@ ll@@ in , Pro@@ po@@ x@@ yp@@ hen , S@@ ali@@ zy@@ s@@ late and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ isers , such as Bet@@ ab@@ lock@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ in , Guan@@ eth@@ id@@ ine and reserves the symptoms of in@@ ep@@ in@@ ep@@ in@@ ants may be shiel@@ ded or missing . &quot;
&quot; animal @-@ experimental studies on the reproduction of animal studies showed no differences between in@@ su@@ e and human@@ ization in terms of pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ enters into the human mother &apos;s milk , but in general , insulin is not resor@@ bed to the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it resor@@ bed to or@@ aler application . &quot;
&quot; following are the clinical trials known from clinical studies , grouped according to system organs and ordered by decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very often : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare ( frequency based on the availability ba@@ - ren data is not estim@@ able ) . &quot;
&quot; cold , silent and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , nerv@@ ousness or weakness , confusion , concentration , loss of vision , headaches , nausea and pal@@ p@@ itations . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy is missed , the injection site within the injection range continuously , can occur in the sequence a Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy at the injection site . &quot;
heavy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic potential with consci@@ ous@@ nesses can be treated by any in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) that is given by an appropriate person or have been treated by intraven@@ ous gift of glucose by a doctor .
&quot; after a glucose object , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin lo@@ wers the blood sugar mirror through the stimulation of the peripher@@ al glucose intake ( especially by skel@@ etal muscle and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing the glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ ans Ga@@ - be of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the efficiency occurs faster and the amount of time is shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ em normal .
&quot; in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 diabetes m@@ li@@ - showed insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the therapeutic effect of 0.@@ 0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg a dose of dis@@ inf@@ ant effect , and at 0.@@ 3 E / kg or more a dis@@ proportionate increase in a glucose @-@ bearing effect , just like human@@ eness . &quot;
insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as rapid impact as a normal human body and achieves the complete glucose effect about 2 hours earlier than human .
&quot; from the data , it was obvious that when there is an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ als gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved as with human@@ eness , which is given 30 minutes before meal . &quot;
&quot; if insulin was ge@@ ta@@ d in 2 minutes before the meal , insulin was achieved better post @-@ ran@@ ale control than with human standard , which was given 2 minutes before meal . &quot;
&quot; if insulin is inserted into 15 minutes after the meal at the start of the meal , insulin is given a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control as in human standard , which is given 2 mi@@ - gro@@ o@@ ves before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin is given 2 minutes before the meal at the start of the meal ( figure 1@@ A ) before the meal at the beginning of the meal ( figure 1@@ A ) as well as compared to human normal , which was given 2 minutes ( normal - before ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin is given 15 minutes ( GL@@ UL@@ IS@@ IN - after the start of the meal compared to human standards , 2 minutes ( normal - before ) before the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) . &quot;
