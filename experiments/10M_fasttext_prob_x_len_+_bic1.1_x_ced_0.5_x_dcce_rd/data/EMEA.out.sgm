<seg id="14">"the effectiveness of bilify, the replacements of symptoms to prevent, was investigated in three studies of up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders that compared to a placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was passed over twelve weeks to 347 patients with semi-operating dol, in another study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo that have been stabilized to 160 patients where the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injector has been compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder that passed on creased unrest with which of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>

<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify for inhaling (observed from 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrappyramidal disruptions (expropriety), headaches, blurred (expropriation), saliva, boldness (nausea), saliva and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnie (sleeping disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">The EP committee on human pharma (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in patients who had mainly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes have talked to treatment with Aripiprazole to weigh against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the Committee came to the outcome that the advantages of injecting solution in the rapid control of gestures and behavioural problems in patients with schizophrenia, or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if a oral therapy is not suitable to outweigh the risks."</seg>
