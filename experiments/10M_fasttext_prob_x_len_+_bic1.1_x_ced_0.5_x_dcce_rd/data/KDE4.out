&quot; the package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; in spite of its low size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; by making these easier available . &quot;
further information on the use of &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ;
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or , select Settings enhancements .... open the card tools and select the desired modules . &quot;
&quot; this is a list of standard settings , from the package box ; add @-@ ons . please note that any more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed . &quot;
&quot; you should install the package base , the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; includes , before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the cras@@ hing module , click in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; at ex@@ tras cras@@ hes . then you can view the page , the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; for cras@@ hing , or the list of cras@@ hes , if available . &quot;
the module filter filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Ex@@ tras An@@ tim@@ filter . with the module you can filter &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory on different ways .
&quot; to display the DO@@ M map in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or , select Ex@@ tras DO@@ M @-@ tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as an adjustment begins the display with the root node of the document , example : document@@ aries , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root window . &quot;
&quot; the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view of objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ Type I@@ node / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbols and text views , so as to view the content of your local file system . &quot;
&quot; the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in it , conce@@ aled folder @-@ hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree map . each object is proportional to its size . this size must possess the property that the sum of the sizes of sub@@ ordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; at &amp; FS@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or folder , while the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . accordingly , big files can be detected far down in the folder hierarchy . accordingly , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you will be considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ map representation is a rec@@ tan@@ gle that represents a file , or a folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the right @-@ corner of meaningful colours and cap@@ tion settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rec@@ tan@@ gle , which is switched on color mode , can be either a depth of the light detection of the fittings or the representation of another file , such as name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E @-@ type . &quot;
&quot; a rec@@ tan@@ gle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property you can determine if it is displayed at all , only if enough space to display is present ( whereby therefore Dar@@ ing errors can occur due to the sign of the stair@@ way ) . furthermore , you can set the relative position of cap@@ tion in rec@@ tan@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; the display algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps should be maintained that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ emap in &amp; FS@@ View ; this goal will not always be respected . note that less space is lost for the frame , if the rec@@ tan@@ gle quad@@ r@@ atic is . &quot;
&quot; as distribution of the area of an entry for the sub@@ ordinate entries is made , the implementation is left to it . here , it is up to the marking and avoiding space loss by setting up that rec@@ tan@@ gle are created , which are as quad@@ r@@ atic . the best methods of this are lines , columns , or recur@@ sive second . &quot;
&quot; you can indicate the minimal set area for an entry over the menu entry view . instead , a smo@@ ker pattern is drawn into the area of the superior entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a sub@@ ordinate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets , designed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ e@@ gr@@ ind . &quot;
the module images can be found in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu under ex@@ tras picture gallery ... or with C@@ TR@@ L ; I .

the option title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery in a text box .
the option images per line has a sli@@ der and a turn@@ around to adjust the number of mini@@ shots of each line in the gallery .
&quot; with the closing field of the picture , you show whether the fil@@ en@@ ames are displayed among mini@@ images in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the cross @-@ field file size of the picture , you determine whether the file size is shown below the mini @-@ pictures in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the image size , you show whether the size of the images is shown below the mini @-@ pictures in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in a dialog folder , you determine where the gallery will be saved and which sub@@ folders are to be included . &quot;
&quot; in the file selection store in HTML file , you can specify where the HTML @-@ page is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; with the sub@@ folders sub@@ folder you can draw with a sli@@ der or a rotating field , up to which level the sub@@ folders are included . &quot;

&quot; one of the most beautiful things to be released , is how easy to extend its functionality by modules : &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I module : the K@@ DE Image plug @-@ ins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; checking ; , K@@ Phot@@ o@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . goal is to provide the modules for all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it &apos;s much easier to supplement it , by writing a small module to supplement a function as the changes in &amp; digi@@ tization ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the side with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ TR@@ L + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; draw and disc@@ ard pictures works everywhere : you can disc@@ ard a picture in another part of the table , above the horizontal separation line or into another application window . the only limitation is that a picture does not appear in keywords , file list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file selection allows you to raise the most common : JP@@ EG , P@@ NG , T@@ IF@@ F , Ro@@ h , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is used only for the fields , which are currently displayed in the tool@@ bar . thus , the filters on the fil@@ en@@ ame only works if this ind legs will appear . which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ ding settings . &quot;

&quot; the buttons El@@ t@@ ester , average , new@@ ester : these set the date on the one of the oldest , the latest image or the cut out of the album . first , first tries to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of last change of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; when you first got an album in &amp; digi@@ tization ; open the first image in the album as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ l@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; selected . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative , and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you must click on the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; As a album button on the list , you can put the photo on the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be wasted .

&quot; the keywords will be stored in a database for quick access and wei@@ ghted key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the picture , at least for JP@@ EG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . besides , the tags in the loss of the database re @-@ imported as soon as I got the images noticed . &quot;
&quot; you can add new words by clicking with the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My key@@ word , or add new key@@ word . if you add a new key@@ word , after you have clicked on an existing password , this one becomes the sub@@ ver@@ word of this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a key@@ word by clicking the key@@ word with the right mouse button and Dele@@ te . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the key@@ word will be removed from this photo . &quot;

&quot; select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ TR@@ L ; L D@@ em lighthouse will add from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lumin@@ ous menu . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ table ; main window , you can open the light @-@ table quickly with L ex@@ tras . &quot;
&quot; from the preview bar you can compare the pictures you want to compare , to the left or right area of the window and drop there . a small arrow shows you the copy in which window bar , then you will be able to preview the same section of the two images . so you can compare the same area of the two images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to load quickly from a picture series . if you use pa@@ ar@@ ingly navig@@ ating from the tool@@ bar , then the two first pictures are automatically displayed in the fields of comparisons . you now use the left mouse button in the right @-@ hand side to view it in the right area . this makes it easier to work through a number of similar pictures . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal holes work directly from the light as e.g. F@@ 4 file Edit .... &quot;
&quot; all picture information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both models in light . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data . &quot;
&quot; at the lower end of each area , you will find a built @-@ in shot function that you can see at the crossed arrows . to counter the visible area of the picture , you need to view this and the &amp; L@@ MB ; follow in mode then both pictures show the same picture . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . simply use the z@@ oom controller under the pictures or C@@ TR@@ L ; scroll wheel in the image in and out to zo@@ oming . this happens in both pictures when you preview in the mode .
what is a digital press management - apart from the modem word ? digital press management considers every part of the process after the picture has been taken up to the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the photos takes up , scans or digital photos , does not take a form of digital media management . however , most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient manner . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to secure your pictures , protect and use photos again . we consider the downloading , ren@@ ame , group@@ ing , assess , maintenance , maintenance and export of image files . &quot;
&quot; digital display administration takes on , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , seeks , transforming , ready @-@ assembled , and exports content that contain a mon@@ tage or cultural value . &quot;
met@@ adata are defined as data on data . met@@ adata are provided according to your definition data that will provide information about or documentation from other data that are managed by an application or environment .
&quot; I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t even need to find a certain photo . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you definitely use &amp; checking in a database and in the images to store very fast searches and a secure archiving on which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you want to cultivate something into your system , the structure of information structure is organized in contrast to the data structure . you need to decide whether other access to your photos do not want to save it on your machine or run on a network drive &amp; etc . note that you will have to switch to a larger drive at some point . &quot;
&quot; maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly through your memory location . if you have enough photos , then you will download sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 , 2008 @-@ 02 , 2008 @-@ 02 , 2008 @-@ 02 , 2008 @-@ 02 , 2008 @-@ 02 , 2008 @-@ 02 , then use a folder for pictures that you can print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements like e.g. version of photos , archiving , work processes , constant intake of pictures on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % of archives and 5 % work files have and you will not want to organise your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the pile processing simpler . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived picture .
&quot; we also recommend the option met@@ adata to store in the settings page of the met@@ adata in &amp; digi@@ tization ; this ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently be able to save the met@@ adata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate point menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? this gives you a met@@ adata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important . &quot;
&quot; now the real work starts , as you now select any photo keywords , cap@@ tions and evaluation . of course , you can select all the pictures that need the same attribute and then put the value . it makes sense since you can concentrate on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; let us now come with keywords , ke@@ epers , as described in other programs frequently , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same cause . &quot;
&quot; if you import cat@@ alo@@ ised images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; sync the tree to the right place . the sort of hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done through creating a sub@@ tree to another . the changed keywords will be deleted from &amp; digi@@ tising ; updated while it pursu@@ es the sub @-@ trees . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different met@@ adata over@@ cut itself . this is a very rough representation , since each block of met@@ adata in truth consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar dates features all pictures . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to cat@@ alo@@ ise your met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; most anyone don &apos;t want to let your photos just see , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are sure to be interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then catch some details to see people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I tell you that this is the Lan@@ de@@ platz of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ man@@ die 60 years after landing is . wow ! one starts to dream , associations , the historical time span has been present again , you might even hear the silence . so the cap@@ tion has changed your perception of this panor@@ amas . &quot;
&quot; for others who consider your photos , the title may be more important than the picture itself to produce an interest . remember , the key is it the meaning to the viewer to help Him learn about the motif you move has to understand what you understand . &quot;
it is fine when a picture is not perfect when the strength has only to work with only one cap@@ tion for themselves .
&quot; with &amp; checking , you can use any as much text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as cap@@ tion . you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time . K@@ DE will even display it for a selection of pictures at the same time . K@@ DE will even tell you a spelling examination according to your wishes into the cap@@ tion and / or the title of the Web site . &quot;
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find yourself in another city without navigation system ? was they earth not a boring planet from Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well because with pictures the turn of the spatial presentation now starts with light speed .
&quot; the possibilities to exploit the ge@@ olo@@ urs are already innum@@ erable and will be used in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can also repeat the photos on the recording site . you can also export c@@ ml files even to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps Viewer . &quot;
&quot; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and refers to the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you which information you got in the furnishings of &amp; checking ; as information is deposited there :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creators and writers ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo , e.g. to protect the name of the photographer , for example , the name of a company or organisation can be used . this field does not support Kom@@ mas nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for editor ) : linked to the author . examples of this field contains the work designation of the photographer . examples for this can be title as : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or Independent photographer . as this is a note to the author &apos;s field , this must be as completed as well . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the an@@ ium box to identify who works the photo . this must not necessarily be the author . if the photographer is listed here for a message agency like Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press , these organizations can be listed here . if the image is a camp photo , then here the group / agency displays the image here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this cannot provide protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or change . the solution for this problem is digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this protection is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and Hal@@ b professionals this protection is very important . &quot;
&quot; the digital water@@ marks is unique per picture . &amp; &apos;s , in the near future , such a module will be available for batch processing . &quot;
&quot; topics : plate errors , plate , black@@ outs , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging the storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , des@@ ast@@ er@@ esis , lifetime , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ sti@@ tions &quot;
&quot; of course , we are not talking about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of loss are the same who can also happen to you with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section we deal with problems with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll On@@ track , the biggest data structure of the world , has some interesting statistics which reasons a data loss . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs must be treated cautious , and you may not be able to buy more difficult than a couple of years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality . there are offers of gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . whether you believe this is in your meas@@ urer room . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you are using good discs and good recording devices and they are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot of reliable . so it turns the right to select the right . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors , even if you have just been written . therefore , they use a control mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for the form@@ atting and the control environment . despite this massive protection they need for chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that seems to be miracles for CDs and DVDs . however , similar applications are not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from defective dis@@ ks , hard drives , flas@@ h@@ media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to store the For@@ mat@@ war against the HD DVD . a dual Lay@@ er Blu @-@ ray Disk can save 50 GB and thus almost h@@ sm@@ al the capacity of a dual Lay@@ er DVD with 8.@@ 5 GB . everything which was said to CDs and DVDs was also true of the Blu @-@ ray disc .
&quot; burn slowly with a good recording unit on high quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ate format . after that , you can copy the media with a description , dark dry and above animals protected place . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media or software that can read this media . &quot;
disco manufacturers retain your statistics for themselves . your production warranty includes a new disk but not the data . Google will provide a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard@@ dis@@ ks : dis@@ error study
&quot; shortly : dis@@ ks keep the longest on the longest when you operate in the temper@@ ament of 35 ° C up to 45 ° C . with lower temper@@ ament , the error @-@ rate is dramatically increasing . some of the SM@@ ART reported bugs will notice the immediate forthcoming failure . this is especially read@@ ef@@ eh@@ ler and publishing count . the expected lifes@@ pan is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only a complete loss due to over@@ tension . of course , you can also have data loss due to an electric case before you have secured the files , but these losses arise normally without any major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices are not much difference , the devices made with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors are different . these can cause severe damage . in your machine , these anom@@ ali@@ es are blocked , hardware loss , destruction mother@@ boards and other defects . thus protect yourself from un@@ avo@@ id@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most widespread protection against electricity tips is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device , that a part of the energy benefits are absorbed and the rest er@@ det . it is usually available in the form of a pin@@ point bar . remember , however , that not each St@@ ec@@ ker@@ bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you look for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to protection against Bl@@ itz@@ büh@@ el and thus protect the properly connected devices . &quot;
&quot; since an over@@ voltage can use any cable to your machine , you should pay attention to that also all the peripher@@ als , which can also be connected to your system . some manufacturers provide over @-@ voltage capability , which also provide a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ axi@@ al cord of cable and TV . &quot;
&quot; if you have an emergency , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a large number of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . so you are ideal for the travel . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection your system protects your system from smaller fluctu@@ ations in electricity lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in uninterrupted power supply . &quot;
&quot; besides protection from over@@ power@@ ing , these devices can automatically make cordless energy available when a black@@ out occurs . however , some models allow them to even further work up till the current . if you buy a US@@ V then you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the underlying software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; concerns the potential risk to which your computer system is exposed and compare your security in black@@ ness with the costs to avoid this . a high quality super@@ lative protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 20 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected . to conclude , you should always think all the cables to separate before you go to holidays . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web @-@ Service contains S@@ 3 - Simple storage service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to save this as a backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with you to store any amount of data . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with hard@@ dis@@ ks , they are very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you have to send the data via the compar@@ atively slow Internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services available to photos . your free memory is available to 1 GB and you will not be able to use your images in full resolution online . the professional version provides you with unlimited memory , which should be checked in reality only . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of the data backup , the Web @-@ solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically generated thanks to the TCP protocol and with the big companies is included in the offering a backup and a shared memory . so that &apos;s why they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ able . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem and b@@ tr@@ fs provide at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that nobody says if a transmission mistake occurred to you . all these disorders remain un@@ discovered until you have no protection in your computer . nobody seems to have thought of it . no one seems to have thought of it . the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer .
&quot; un@@ reliable network parts are another source of transmission losses since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . with normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two Candi@@ dates , which are possible with record @-@ level license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon available for &amp; Linux , and Windows available soon . read this article in English . &quot;
&quot; Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ allet file system . this is still in the Alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms the z@@ fs and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is still not part of the kernel . &quot;
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the notebook and 46 % on job systems . at not@@ ebooks the proportion of theft amounts to 50 % .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than the guinea @-@ ists . it leads to a lower damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently not limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only have very few viruses and under Linux . no longer has been sighted . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems : incorrect , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , itinerary , J@@ FS and X@@ FS , to call the common file systems . you can find a very good English article here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems are preventing corrupted data and data loss : incorrect , only the speed of the research process at a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status will be avoided . if a file was not completely saved before the problem appeared , it is lost . &quot;
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human mistakes are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
&quot; sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical borders . meant that technology is further developed , there is a natural limit for these progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit . &quot;
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 Meg@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ mond sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and a high quality op@@ tics are the optimum for compact cameras . even D@@ SLR cameras have your border with 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard disk is available today for 100 &amp; euro ; so make sure your data is affected by a data loss . therefore , you can use your data frequently according to a plan and test this backup before you do anything like the re@@ installation of your operating system , exchange of records or the magnitude of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash , you have luck if the drive was not connected in the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster suggests locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aer@@ ospace : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data . they usually affect a whole room or complete house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ vor@@ es always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups to the stairs into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for a loss of data despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files are to be secured . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential security : a backup of the files has been altered since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot of at two periods : to the complete protection and the last difference .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been altered since the last backup . you can restore the original status at any time in which such backup was made . this backup occurs the next one with the exception that it is only sealed and not constant .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily configure your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file tran@@ scripts copied r@@ sync only the difference of files that were really changed . this is compressed and if you would like to increase security over ssh .
secure important images directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or other optical medium .
&quot; this approach leaves you enough time to discover losses and restore it . at the same time , you come for the backup , however with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of labour files . at the end , you will have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for every month . each additional di@@ lution should be done manually , after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; topics : met@@ adata , in the image file saved IP@@ TC information , original software , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ viewing images and met@@ adata , copy the pictures to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visibility , ... , use of the internet . &quot;
&quot; to survive valuable images over the next 40 year , that is about the time period in which you really are interested in you because they are reminded of your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; because the future is un@@ predictable because of your nature , you have to look at all of what is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate while the current system goes back@@ wards . the less variations you have used in the past . the less variations you have used in the past , the easier it is to assess the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards which are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important for reading your images , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : each time you change your machine architecture , your memory and safety technology , or your file format , you should review your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the professional print of the ability to change a system in its size . this actually means growing .
let &apos;s assume that you have plans the scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition . at * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this section and shift it to a new record :
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , if your new record was detected by the system , but do not attach it . &quot;
&quot; / dev / s@@ db # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; Dollar ; # with ext@@ 2,3 , fat@@ ted / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of reis@@ er@@ fs if necessary &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no more software that can read , then you can create them yourself . this task will be easier from year to year . &quot;
gi@@ f is a proprietary and patented format disappears slowly from the market . therefore you should not use it any more .
&quot; P@@ NG was designed as an open source standard to replace the G@@ IF , but it can be a lot more . it is los@@ ely , supported X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can only use many administrative information , but not as many as T@@ IF@@ F requires and slow dance expression . this format we would like to recommend you to save your pictures . &quot;
T@@ IF@@ F was widely used as picture format . T@@ IF@@ F can be stored in un@@ compressed format or container with a loss of free comp@@ utation . there are therefore more than 50 different types . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a licence @-@ free and open @-@ format @-@ format that is developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G was developed on the T@@ IF@@ F / EP format and committed to the use of met@@ adata . a handful of cam@@ ents have already been made available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon .
&quot; this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Pl@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata , which is a mixture of XML and quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive a original of your recording , mostly in the shell format , but it can store the met@@ adata separately from the image file . however , you should think about whether you use DN@@ G as containers and put everything there together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organisation that supports the work for fully compatible online met@@ adata standards , offering an extensive range of applications and modelling , discussions and collaborative work within the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are available on cam@@ am@@ edi@@ um , you can use this as temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save them in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a fine processing , you can use external programs . if you have the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ tization ; edit , then you should add the met@@ adata . these have been cut off from other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the processed pictures for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . then export it into Web@@ galleries , enco@@ ding in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc . &quot;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; checking ; add a description on how you can add photos which you already have on your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import images to your alarm database . &quot;
&quot; to get your digital camera with &amp; checking , connect them to the machine , turn off the camera to display mode and turn it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a he@@ et indicator appears at the bottom and the preview images of all photos on the camera will be displayed . some cameras do not display preferences and a symbol for file order for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your machine , you may need the camera information to each entry . with the page features and met@@ adata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an application or its met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; this dialog shows file properties and the photo information , which is stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the picture has not been downloaded to your machine . note that some digital cameras do not provide any information . &quot;
&quot; the rider met@@ adata shows the internal met@@ adata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer notice , GPS etc . the image . this information is the same as in met@@ adata page , or image processing . note that these met@@ adata for some digital cameras are not available . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then download the choice of All . this invites all the photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es. download the photos were downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired using the default methods from &amp; k@@ ies ; select the button download and then download the chosen option . the button selected is long as long as you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera is supported , an option is new to download . these images have not been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es.@@ In this case the new pictures are downloaded with a star in pre @-@ shot window . if you choose this option , of course , only the new pictures are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; when you download the buttons all or download the buttons , appear a dialog , with which you can select the target album , shown in which the photos are sorted . select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after which you have chosen the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ tization ; invites the photos from the camera into the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can clear all at once by using the button Dele@@ te All . if you only want to delete them , then you must select it first and delete your chosen delete . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no possibility to restore photos that you have been deleted from the camera , so you should carefully check if the photos were successful in a &amp; checking ; you should immediately delete it from the camera . if you want to delete them from the camera , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; cameras are used as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not particularly expres@@ sive names . this can result in double fil@@ en@@ ames in case you have taken pictures of different constell@@ ations in the same album . therefore , it can be useful , the date and time when the image has been made to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ames . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you will find options for the rotating and reflection of the picture and for dat@@ ag@@ basi@@ lar sub@@ folders . if you use this last option , automatically a folder will be created each day . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three further options to be performed before the photos are stored on the record . the first two concern the data about the author in paragraph Standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty . with the latest option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; if you desire another file format than the standard format , for example in the editing field , you can use the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- % Y@@ - % discount : % M . place the option date &amp; time . for further adjustments you should read the help of the command line . &quot;
&quot; when you use the camera file name , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in small case letters . or in case letters , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , used &amp; checking for a photo , is displayed below the name that displays the camera in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window . &quot;
&quot; finally , all information on the orientation of the camera should use to perform an automatic rotation during download . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ adata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera fails to provide this information , the photo in its original orientation . if you want to switch off the automatic rotation , use the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; when your camera has information about the date , where the photo was made available , may &amp; digi@@ tization . all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras are available on the image album . in the side@@ bar Met@@ a data you can read , which information your camera could have embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually off , and in that case , store &amp; digi@@ tization ; the photos directly on the target album . if you want to change this option , you need to switch this option and select the file @-@ based sub@@ tile at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is button download . select then up@@ loading . the file op@@ tionally &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files that are up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ ies ; methods .
&quot; after the picture selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ tization ; you , where the images are to be up@@ loaded . a folder panel dialog for the camera will be displayed . select the desired folder and press OK to start the up@@ loading . the pictures are not deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is meant as a general term in this document . it is a position that is specified in length and lati@@ tudes , which can be shown on a map . determining the data can be done by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to extract an area through automatic recording of GPS data to kar@@ to@@ graphic . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents may use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have lost later , where exactly the photo was done , you can open with a click on a browser which can display the area . if you want to loc@@ alise a postcard to another , or just want to document this aspect , it &apos;s good to record the position of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 have supported many GPS data fields such as direction , Satt@@ el@@ ites and card@@ refer@@ encies . directly , using the right hardware , via editing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to the geographical assignment ( manual ) , and finally about the manual type of known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receiver . either as a map module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ote@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon D@@ SLR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done using g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ p@@ s@@ ba@@ bel . you must save this data but in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format that is supported by the module to the geographical assignment .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract data from pictures and from GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux : g@@ p@@ s@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ p@@ s@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itu@@ dinal and latitude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the sign @-@ made coordinates , which are created for example by m@@ ap@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; m@@ ap@@ s.@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European street cards . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; finally , I tried to give you so much control over his work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that you access the behaviour of &amp; digi@@ tization . to switch to these settings , you must switch between these settings . you can switch between them by clicking on the symbols of the left . &quot;
this action can be shown on an em@@ powered preview or picture editing . you attach the default behaviour of &amp; checking ; notes when you click on an entry in the main view .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the Stand@@ ardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically selected in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields . also with a database synchron@@ ization , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; author is a syn@@ onym for editor : this field should be the professional photographer of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as starter photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a further description to the author , this must be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to enter the photo . this must not be the author , if this is an image agency , such as Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press , then the group or agency should be available here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions save the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC rock . this will be achieved that the met@@ adata is constantly contained in the picture and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ tization ; these met@@ adata are also available to other programs and can be imported in &amp; checked ; imported goods will be lost without lost .
images as in@@ embedded description ( J@@ F@@ IF ) to save images ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JP@@ EG images : this is synchron@@ ized the comments that you add to your photos as well as images contained in the pictures are written by the images that have already written ; over@@ written .
&quot; the page settings contains all the options for the information , which appear when the mouse cursor in the main window via a file rests . according to the chosen option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; # 160 ; checking out ; supports a number of different image formats , and some video formats . to determine which file types &amp; digi@@ tization ; tries to indicate which file types and checking , then you can delete the file exten@@ tions of this list ; released each file , which none of these extensions has been released , ignored by &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Re@@ aders to the right of any category .
&quot; the settings of the lumin@@ ous of &amp; digi@@ tising ; can open on this page on the default values . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , then you can only get better results . &quot;
&quot; by default , the image processing uses a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer another color , you can choose it here . you can switch the tool@@ bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposure areas of an image can be marked with darker or bri@@ ghter colour in the picture . these colors will be set here . in picture editing this picture mode can be activated with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
&quot; with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling , it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color formations . please read this article in Wikipedia for the near@@ er statement . &quot;
&quot; using the P@@ NG compression speeds you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality , since P@@ NG needed more time for initial and un@@ packing . thereby , you can put this value to a high compression . thereby , 1 : a low and 9 means high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the option T@@ IF@@ F files , you can turn the de@@ fl@@ ate -@@ compres@@ sion@@ ism for T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . it does not affect the image quality , as the De@@ fl@@ ate algorithm losses are free . &quot;
&quot; the attitude of loss @-@ free JP@@ EG @-@ 2000 files you can save loss @-@ free . even if you have been writing the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JP@@ EG . when this paragraph has been written , met@@ adata were not yet supported , but in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; checking , the image processing was only a picture holder for photos . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool for manipulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the default sheet is that all green pixels are equal . if you use this option , solve this problem with minimal loss of details . this option draws the image a little soft , eliminated however the 2@@ x@@ 2 G@@ itter@@ p pattern with the V@@ NG@@ C or the A@@ HD @-@ quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the whit@@ eboard is used at the camera . otherwise , when it is set , the automatic color balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this option is used only if the white is not set off . standard is it a fixed color balance , which was photographed on a white card that was photographed in sunlight . &quot;
this option is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super C@@ CD SLR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images can get more details in the shre@@ ws . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the default is it the pointed , so the parts of your images are burned down , due to the in@@ ability of your camera to see the shre@@ ws . finally , use the c@@ lich@@ ens in various ro@@ bes . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the cutting edge . &quot;
&quot; this is possible , since blue pixels in general are not as fast s@@ laugh@@ tered as green and red . &amp; nbsp ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still saturated blue pixel . of course , this is a question of how many color or wh@@ ites you want . &quot;
&quot; if you choose to re@@ construct the option , you get the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted for each image individually . &quot;
put the L@@ umin@@ ous value to your taste . you probably have to put it a bit higher than the standard 1 . but this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ tization ; to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small should you proceed conservative .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to get a full picture from the particle data sensor which have many cameras and a matrix colour . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour construction .
&quot; concluded ; and D@@ cra@@ w are provided with three alternatives : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm that was used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it creates color fac@@ tual on edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color @-@ sof@@ tening of your lenses , you can set the red and blue @-@ proof values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , as it is carried out during the blan@@ ket . &quot;
&quot; a profile transl@@ ates the color formations , and gives instructions how these should be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ tization ; information like the color @-@ information from a color tree to translate into the other so that colours are as accurate as possible . &quot;
behaviour questions when an image is opened in image processing / color management module with Cru@@ de .
&quot; color folder Set@@ ts here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles . &amp; sync ; examine these folders then during the start . &quot;
&quot; settings of ICC profiles , you have the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ad ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the shell file later . &quot;
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your images color manages not the entire screen .
input profiles should match the cam@@ els and model that you use . not all profiles are included in the same way . currently there are some examples such as Canon who do not have a color mapping or Gam@@ ma@@ correction . currently d@@ cra@@ w Gamma is not correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the color mapping yourself .
&quot; there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your image can be given back from one device . this is very useful before you can print image , as your printer can rely on a smaller color area as your camera and some colors therefore very saturated , rather than to rely on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious which colour profile is provided for what is intended for . unfortunately , here &apos;s a table of cameras and profiles which suit together . this answer is naturally in@@ official : &quot;
&quot; Canon pro@@ curing lets the style be recognized for the goal : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Neutr@@ al , P for portrait and S for the Standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . it &apos;s an interface that can be supported by a number of &amp; k@@ ts ; ima@@ gery and image work@@ ings . by delivering this interface , many modules have been supported to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see a list of available modules . select which you want to use , and these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview . &quot;
&quot; instructions for tasks that can be performed by modules , can be set in the menu under settings . &quot;
for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I project you can get via the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ging .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the configuration of the slides should be easy to understand . the upper regul@@ ator j@@ us@@ hed the time between image inputs , normally , 4 @-@ 5 seconds is good . the other attacks turn the met@@ adata that are displayed at the bottom of the pictures during the display . &quot;
&quot; the camera features shown on the left @-@ hand side a list of all the cameras supported . on the right side there is a button Autom@@ atic detection , which tries to identify the camera . currently , here , serial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage is supported . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) -@@ mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire @-@ bulk storage camera . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ able , specify on which you attach your camera . &quot;
&quot; to check your digital camera with &amp; checking , you need to connect the camera to your machine to turn it in the display mode . &quot;
&quot; try out whether &amp; digi@@ tization ; the camera automatically recognizes . if not , you can set cam@@ am@@ od@@ ell and port manually . once you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the menu Camera . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all here . &quot;
&quot; with the option verification dialog for reloc@@ ating &gt; pictures in the tr@@ ash@@ can display , you can adjust the conversation of &amp; digi@@ tization ; to delete a photo in an album . in the sections of a photo and del@@ eting a album you can find more details . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes made by the right side bar , tac@@ it through &amp; checking , will apply if you use the option to apply changes in the right side bar without set@@ backs . otherwise , you need to apply changes to the button changes . &quot;
you can also download the display of the welcome screen from &amp; digi@@ tization ; when starting up . this will accelerate in circumstances the start process of &amp; digi@@ tization ;
&quot; the setting Bei@@ m Start you search for new photos , forcing &amp; digi@@ tization ; the basic folder after new or deleted albums / photos came . this extends the time @-@ time folder , asks &amp; digi@@ tization ; you , whether it should delete it from the database . &quot;
different shades can be used in &amp; checking ; used to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected under settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs are listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; checking , you will find more information about it in this tutorial . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ tization came ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve . image processing can be run by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu for viewing or editing .
image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; checking ; so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I module you will find in the video editing .
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , enlar@@ ging factor , and the current image size shows . &quot;
a menu bar at the top of the top and including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most common functions .
&quot; editing functions of image processing change your photos . however , no functions will change before you save file store or save the button save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image . &quot;
so you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it . this can save you with file saving .
&quot; as long as you don &apos;t have saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using it from the menu File Re@@ manufacture , or use the button . you will then lose any change that you have done on the photo since the last store . &quot;
&quot; virtually every action of the picture editing can be revers@@ ed or recovered . the last action you can un@@ make , by selecting Edit @-@ cat@@ ers or recovered by selecting mach@@ ining from the menu . &quot;
&quot; when you use this frequently , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ TR@@ L ; -@@ Z with the back@@ rest and make C@@ TR@@ L ; -@@ Shift key to the re@@ manufacture . &quot;
&quot; when you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; via the return or re@@ manufacture button in the tool@@ bar , you receive a menu menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions in between also re@@ vert or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation system in tool@@ bar , image high , image down@@ stream or the entries in the menu file , you are asked if you want to save them . &quot;
&quot; in the photo , you can get in the photo and zo@@ oming in which you use C@@ TR@@ L ; scroll wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or use the entries in the contact menu . &quot;
&quot; to adjust a picture to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : enlar@@ ging factor is automatically chosen &quot;
&quot; view full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you come into the normal view , in which you don &apos;t want to use the tool@@ bar . if you do not want this , you can view this in the Settings dialog box . you can access this in the setup dialog box . take a look at the section for setting up the image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current picture , you can select in the File picture menu and get the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu you can print single images or whole sentences . entire picture @-@ looking pages can select from your selection . you only need to select the pictures with the default methods and select from the menu album Export printers . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the first window has a side bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected pictures . the same page bar is available without the navigation panel , also available in the picture editing . it is displayed when one of the five horse@@ men is clicked on : &quot;
multi @-@ day click on the same rider as the side bar lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the edges .
&quot; in the accus@@ ations , you can insert or insert cap@@ tions with unlimited size . this means that all special characters are permitted . description are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ s and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields , so that you can use other programs . &quot;
the IP@@ TC data support only AS@@ C@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut down by 2000 characters and special characters will be re@@ formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC description field in other applications you should consider these restrictions .
&quot; after you have commented on , use either the button or simply switch to the next picture , the cap@@ tions are then saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the apply button there is a button More . with this , you can write further met@@ adata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the met@@ adata into the files . however , this will always be done if you have chosen a met@@ adata that is always written in pictures . &quot;
&quot; the review assessment shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars , and can be used in search and sor@@ ings . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars into the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select it and use the context menu . &quot;
the review is written into the IP@@ TC field . the enco@@ ding follows the sch@@ ema in the following table :
&quot; the sampling view displays a search box to the fil@@ ings of the keywords , the sampling tree and a selection box with the previously used in this &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; session challenged . &quot;
the key@@ word is dynam@@ ically adapted to the search@@ engine . you can restrict the number of options when searching for a key@@ word quickly . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the lower end is a further relief when entering key@@ keys at a picture series . if you have entered various keywords , these are stored for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by flag@@ ging the corresponding suits in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field Key@@ word .
&quot; if several images are selected in the main view and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word tree , this is only applied to the highlighted image and not the entire selection , if you want to add a selection with a key@@ word , please read the sampling filter . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar sampling filter is used to change the selection of the images shown in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - Dat@@ as@@ - , sampling , and search views . if additionally one or more sampling filter from the right is displayed , all keywords are displayed . &quot;
&quot; you can also draw keywords and disc@@ ard it . suppose you have selected several pictures in the main view . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side bar and put on the selection . then a dialogue , which you ask if you want to put the key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window shows the images on a calendar tag . the sampling filter is reduced to no keywords , what the amount shown on three images . they were selected with Str@@ g + a ; and after that a key@@ word asks from the right sampling tree to the selection and placed there . a dialogue asks if this key@@ word should be placed . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at any start of the program . it can also be switched under settings Miscellaneous .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and determine that it should be one or its , you can easily change it with a double @-@ click on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry that is sought after in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , picture , key term , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already set in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can choose a detailed search through all the elements of the database using the following options : &quot;
if you want to group options you need only the check field at the end of the rule and then use the button group . see the options as follows :

this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I used it mainly to &amp; digi@@ tization ; s concrete implementation adapted .
&quot; the reason why one use a color @-@ managed work@@ flow is the colors that have actually photographed or sc@@ anned colors . with a Color@@ ful work@@ flow , you can reach that colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you are printing out of your digital dark room . &quot;
&quot; when the topic comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he must press for the results that he wants . unfortunately , color administration , that you informed you to find adequate background information about color administration . in addition , you should find links with deeper information allowing you to make your own informed decisions so that you can obtain the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your image work@@ flow meets all the criteria listed below , you don &apos;t need to worry about colo@@ uring . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ R@@ GB farms . ( further information can be found below )
&quot; their only other image expendi@@ tures are via email or the web , where s@@ R@@ GB of de @-@ facto standard is . &quot;
so if s@@ R@@ GB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy - why should you use another color room and have thought about colour management ?
&quot; a visual example of the Lim@@ itation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colors that we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ ff@@ ers region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB color tree , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger color leaf@@ lets , so visit Bruce Lin@@ d@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente site and then click on information and then information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to install my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ R@@ GB color room ?
&quot; yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ R@@ GB colour or not , you need to work your monitor , as s@@ R@@ GB , you need to work on s@@ R@@ GB , then you must either use your monitor on the s@@ R@@ GB standard , use an appropriate monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions available to improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before trying a further manual treatment . &quot;
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , rip @-@ off and contrast extend from the menu of correc@@ ting automation correction to automatically try out of your colors the best . you &apos;ll have to experiment with this effect , to see which works best with your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this method will scale the lumin@@ ous values over the whole picture , making it the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ gh@@ test point as bri@@ ghtly as possible without its colo@@ uring . this function is often a magic correction for pictures that are dark or washed . &quot;
&quot; same : this method j@@ us@@ hed the lumin@@ ous factor of the colors of the selected image , so that the h@@ isto@@ gram of Inten@@ sity consists of the same number of pixels . sometimes it achieves the very good results in improving the contrasts of an image , sometimes it also produces a very powerful operation , which either causes miracles in a picture or destroyed it . &quot;
&quot; automatic paragraph : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright bor@@ der@@ land and j@@ us@@ hed the red , green and blue @-@ can@@ als to complete h@@ isto@@ grams . &quot;
contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values on the greatest possible area and a novel@@ ty of all values in between . this is only visible in tap@@ ed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white ab@@ stain from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ts ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white ab@@ rup@@ ting of a photo .
&quot; the white @-@ off correction is somewhat restricted to work via a color room with 8 @-@ bit per color . so if you are able to perform too far from original image , in case you are able to perform the white ab@@ rupt in the white mode , so your possibilities are correct to correction . &quot;
&quot; this tool is based on a white @-@ equivalent , protected by Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym . &quot;
&quot; the curtains can be adjusted in size . on the left hand , both the original image and preview of the target frame . the preview is dynam@@ ically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white straight away , it &apos;s enough to click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the target images has a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ ancy of the pixels under this mark@@ er is shown as vertical line in the h@@ isto@@ gram .
&quot; on the right side , a h@@ isto@@ gram appears that dynam@@ ically changed as soon as you change a parameter . this h@@ isto@@ gram is very helpful , even in well illuminated images , most pixels very small L@@ umin@@ escent values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colours or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your outcome depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shade will allow you to improve the shadow details of your photos , or may also break down . &quot;
&quot; to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . push for this button and then somewhere to use the color temperature of the whit@@ eboard . this way , the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the whit@@ eboard with the list of preferences . the following settings are available : &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors , if more than one colour channel of the Pix@@ els is over@@ exposed . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image . &quot;
&quot; buttons Save as and Laden make exactly this . each setting of the white balance you have set , you can save it into a text file and later load again . &quot;
&quot; the button @-@ settings sets all the filter values back to its standard values , and the associated neutral white @-@ sli@@ ces . note that also neutral settings can result in another photo than your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; you can adjust here the enco@@ ding image per color channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit co@@ ding is the widespread JP@@ EG format , 16 @-@ bit co@@ ding is better for high @-@ quality pictures . this enco@@ ding requires also more turn@@ around , calcul@@ ating time and stands on@@ ly@@ for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IF@@ F and DN@@ G available . &quot;
&quot; this tool will open the same dialogue as the editing of color images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . a detailed guide for use of color profiles can be applied to the chapter of color management . &quot;
another important tool can be found in the menu under colors t@@ abl@@ ing correction . this tool provides an integrated way to use multiple color channels simultaneously . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always need the same bug and you will always need the same correction . in the manual for ton@@ ing correction you will find further information .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colours gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; proposal came ; tools Far@@ ming effects presents you four color effects , a solar power effect , a ne@@ on effect and a channel filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ ization , also called Sab@@ ati@@ ans , an effect that was created when one developed a partial pressure of a short bl@@ itz@@ ring and then inver@@ ted the development of the picture . the result was a part neg@@ atively negative of the picture . this tool permits you to adjust this interesting effect fine . &quot;
the intensity controls the solar structure . at approx . 50 % intensity shows the image which is chem@@ ically possible . another increase is ultimately creates a negative picture that does not create a photo paper .
this is an example of the solar @-@ performance effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the ( 2 ) . the effective intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; -@@ effect . it differs from a sati@@ ating effect that makes it a stronger contrasts that makes the colors brilliant and glo@@ wing . try it simple , he em@@ bell@@ ishes many photos . &quot;
&quot; Vel@@ via is the brand name for a day@@ light @-@ optimized colour movie which is manufactured by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ movie . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and with it a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color with day@@ light and high contrasts . the characteristics of the characteristics make him a movie of choice for nature photographers . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated color , but also some phot@@ ograph@@ s , specially to which the barely deserted landscapes , too much . &quot;
the ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on@@ light to the contrasts . the parameter level controls the brightness of outcome and the sliding repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on@@ lich@@ ts . with big images the filter can exploit the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to change the color counter and the lumin@@ osity of the photos . all your steps can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result you use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you can get a photo with bad light conditions you can get the reverse problem : one too large sati@@ ation . even in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation will reduce a good choice for satur@@ ation / satur@@ ation instead of adding them . all changes you can perform in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
&quot; between the complex tool of Gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma is the tool sound correction to improve exposure . even if the dialog on this tool appears very complicated , you need only the area of sli@@ der . more concrete the three sh@@ ale below the h@@ isto@@ grams . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of Inten@@ sity values , a h@@ isto@@ gram , an active channel or the selected range . under the graphs are three tails into the inside and can be moved to change the intention of the picture . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the regul@@ ator and look at it how the picture changes .
&quot; on the right hand side , the original and preview of the picture can be seen as dynamic , updated by the settings of the image , updated . on the left hand , the following options are available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set , whether the h@@ isto@@ gram with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y @-@ axis is presented . for pictures of a digital camera , the linear h@@ isto@@ gram is dominated by a single column . in this case , the linear h@@ isto@@ gram is dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic division is useful . &quot;
&quot; three regul@@ ators : the top for the dark sounds , the middle for the light tones and the lowest for middle notes , often called Gam@@ ma@@ values . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ bags can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically use the shade of shadows , middle and light tones automatically to j@@ us@@ hing . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
&quot; Aus@@ ga@@ des : the utilisation permit the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two regul@@ ators used to change the list of interest as in the input data , for example , to create a simple image as a background while creating something else in the foreground . &quot;
&quot; automatically : with this button , the images are automatically set depending on the Inten@@ sity of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and loading : with these buttons , the values of the file system can be saved and later loaded again . the Gimp level is used . &quot;
&quot; when you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input data will be re@@ activated automatically for all the shade , resources and solar panels . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image for the input of the h@@ isto@@ grams for Rot@@ - , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ escent channels . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all the colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and to provide you with the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect shown only in the preview and it &apos;s not a effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you see an example of the alignment of the input data applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the ga@@ giert are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left @-@ hand side , half of the original is displayed and the target picture . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available : &quot;
modification Channel : this drop @-@ box allows the channel to be changed by the module :
&quot; besides this box , there are two symbols to change between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures created with a digital camera . for pictures with large areas of a constant colour , the linear mode creates a broad beam . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic mode continues . &quot;
&quot; if you move for example a short section to the right , for example the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds are corresponding with dark @-@ ga@@ stri@@ ls and that the pic@@ torial pixel will be darker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos is a red mark to see . if you want to change this mark on the area you want to change , a suitable line will be displayed on the curve , which is the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down , until the value is j@@ us@@ ted to your li@@ king . &quot;
&quot; save as and shop : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . each turn that you have created can hereby be saved in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded . file format is the Gimp spa format . &quot;
&quot; if you create this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes -@@ buttons automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , middle and solar panels . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image for the control points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ kur@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all the paint channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , that means you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s not a effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo which was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ canal . shadow and Sundays was applied with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of the &amp; digi@@ tising ; picture editing is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the shades of the photos .
the channel bl@@ ender is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of image processing .
with the can@@ al@@ op@@ box you can select the color for the h@@ isto@@ gram : this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window will show you a preview . the original can be viewed as compared to your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the picture a vertical line will appear in the h@@ isto@@ gram to show you the appropriate color value .
&quot; controls for the module are right below : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to mix these can@@ als . this is particularly practical if you also activate the appropriate color components . this is particularly convenient when you also activate the appropriate color components . this is particularly convenient when you also use the appropriate color components . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ och@@ rom , the reduction of a color comes to a visible smoking which does not appear at the same place in the colour canal and whose noise pattern can be different in every channel . if that is the case you can reduce your mon@@ och@@ rom conversion in which you can reduce the colour first . &quot;
saving as well as charging buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any bl@@ ender attitude allows you to save and then download . this file format is the Gimp channel mix@@ er format .
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all the colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and to provide you with the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect shown only in the preview and it &apos;s not a effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was new j@@ us@@ ted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the working image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstr@@ action capability . with the development of digital photography is black / white a working step because colour images can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of movie roller profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white movie exposure with a green lime filter . this looks good at all scenarios and fits especially well to portraits of the sky . so much like the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange fil@@ tered : simul@@ ates a black / white movie exposure with a orange lens filter . this improves landscapes with maritime scenes and aerial photos . so much like the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange fil@@ tered .
rot@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white movie exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic state @-@ effects and can simul@@ ate mo@@ on@@ ech@@ less to day time . so similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yel@@ lo@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white movie exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Gel@@ b@@ filter .
&quot; S@@ epi@@ ph@@ aton : generates warm light and medium tones while he adds a bit of cold in the loop . this is very similar to the process of exhau@@ sting a pressure and re@@ development in a sc@@ at@@ ons . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; checking , tool texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture . &quot;
&quot; adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can let it look like an oil painting on a wall , a pop style portrait from enlarged points or like a wall painting on a wall . the menu entry image texture can be used for this . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right raises the appearance of the depth and three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture on the image .
a paper text @-@ together is applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter Rel@@ ief has been set to 200 .
&quot; with the &amp; checking , tool frame can add a decorative frame added to a picture . &quot;
keeping the eye of a be@@ holder in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . an opportunity to keep your attention is to set the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the stre@@ amed eye . under image frame you can start the module from the image processing .
&quot; type : with this parameter , you provide the desired amount of cream for your image . elaborate it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white images ) , ab@@ stain@@ ed it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal for a button effect and decorative adds a brick frame with patterns . &quot;
width : returns the width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is limited by 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target picture decorated with the frame is larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio have . this is important for printing the images , especially when you cut the tool @-@ ratio previously . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can easily insert a form@@ at@@ ted text in an image at any point . this also goes on multiple places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply insert the text and place it with the mouse . use text display , orientation , color from the color room and the drawing set with its properties as you need . you &apos;ll simply select a frame for text and / or half @-@ sighted background . already , the picture is ready . &quot;
&quot; each setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press on the button &quot; OK &quot; . once the picture was saved , the text part of the picture . it cannot be changed anymore . &quot;
&quot; using the &amp; D ; tools Sch@@ abl@@ ones apply , you can lay a template on one picture . &quot;
the menu image template uses in the image processing can be used to attach sten@@ cils via a picture .
&quot; for the sten@@ cil there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , you need to use the P@@ NG file format and should add with maximum compres@@ sing ( 9 ) , so send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; checking ; mailing list commented on users @ k@@ de@@ .org .. &quot;
&quot; when you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your sc@@ anned folder with the button @-@ base folder in dialogue . select the folder in which you copied the folders folder . these settings will be noticed for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder has been set for the sten@@ cils , a building view which reflects the folder structure of the Sch@@ ab@@ domin@@ als . the selection of a folder updated the preview bar of the Sch@@ abl@@ ons automatically . &quot;
&quot; below the preview , there are three buttons with which you can change the magnific@@ ation factor and the position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this button is magni@@ fying the underlying picture . it is set to cent@@ red the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; shr@@ ink : this button res@@ ized the image below . it is set to set the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template on the whole picture , you must res@@ ize the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move this button to move the image below the template . take the image and place it on the desired location .
use OK if you want to apply the template on your image . the image will then be automatically adjusted .
&amp; digi@@ tization came ; produces three different tools for the edge of the field . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharp@@ ens is a traditional tool for sharp@@ ness . it is very fast and easy , but produces especially in dark areas , gra@@ ined pictures . &quot;
un@@ sharp@@ ness mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually sharp@@ ens it rather psych@@ ologic Dun@@ can and it makes it a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copy@@ righted by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three as it truly enhances the sharp@@ ness . it is a little complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjustment .
photos without focus and most of the digi@@ ti@@ zed pictures need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . these elements are smaller than the dissolution into a common colour . the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper . SLR cameras usually need more in@@ compati@@ bly sharp@@ ness than normal cameras for your private user .
&quot; with JP@@ EG images , a camera is often applied in internal field . images in the shell @-@ format however must always be cured in the processing . &quot;
&quot; some scanner can already turn out a focal filter during the reading of the picture . if you disable them , you will get control of your image . &quot;
in some situations you can get useful results by sharp@@ ens a photo with the focal point of view . you can call it with the menu entry .
&quot; you should however deal with caution because the results do not work very naturally : the sharp@@ ness increases the edge of edges , but also ampli@@ fy the noise . in general , you can re@@ focus on the menu entry of the tool . under re@@ focus you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques to draw . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than to shar@@ pen . use the tool for soft signs with the menu entry basket . use the effect on the right side of the Di@@ alo@@ ges will show you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp mask is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview the image will be able to edit . the preview display shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , radius and amount . the default values often create good results and should be tried out first . an increase in radius or amount will reinforce the effect . if you make the in@@ sharp@@ ness mask to strong , smo@@ kes and the impression of gr@@ ats in close proximity to sharp edges . &quot;
&quot; the radius represents a large number of pixels on each side of a edge through the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , they should take pictures of the best in their final resolution . &quot;
the amount will be added to the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped image one of the original is added . this makes the strength of the sharp@@ ness .
&quot; the sul@@ try value is a fraction of the maximum R@@ GB amount and the applicable difference . you can therefore define a minimum difference therefore for a channel of filters . in this way , areas will be avoided with a soft switch between the tones of shar@@ pen@@ ing and hence beauty defects in the faces , Himm@@ ling and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the un@@ sharp mask filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mask was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a sul@@ try = 0.@@ 0 . &quot;
the &amp; proposal came ; tool re@@ focus and focuses on a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright @-@ protected filter filter algorithm from Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to und@@ o a picture on &amp; quot ; re@@ focus on this . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tering . re@@ focus mostly better results than un@@ sharp mask . you can start using it from the menu by drawing colors re@@ focus in the image processing .
&quot; in practice , the circular catch is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche folding has a very long tail , which depends far from the original pixel . the F@@ IR Wiener in@@ verse is also very strongly influenced by the remote pixels . it causes unwanted results . &quot;
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular fold . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most pictures the default value should result . you can bet a higher value when your image is very bl@@ ur@@ red then please note to Heiligen@@ vou@@ chers .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ est effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; smoking filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values can reduce values from 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0,@@ 1 is rarely useful . if the noise is too low , the image quality is 0,@@ 03 . a viable value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value will be even further entr@@ apped . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;s archipelago . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid po@@ orer ar@@ te@@ facts . in most cases you should use this value un@@ equal to zero , so you might also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
Mat@@ ri@@ ghtful size : this value determines the size of the transform@@ ational size . an increase in matri@@ mon@@ ial size can create good results if you choose big values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the gau@@ ze . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focus parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try to carry out all the cuts , color and intention centers on the picture before you use the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but later left un@@ pleasant ar@@ te@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; when you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JP@@ EG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
generally un@@ sharp Mas@@ k@@ ills produces better results than sharp@@ ens . this could be causing the un@@ sharp meas@@ ur@@ ging a larger neighbourhood than sharp@@ ens .
&quot; theoretically , un@@ sharp Mas@@ k@@ ills must always produce arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of un@@ sharp@@ ness . it is practically the result of the F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters always at least as good as the un@@ sharp@@ ness mask . the F@@ IR Wiener filters is often better in the processing of small details . &quot;
below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small un@@ focused picture :
the original un@@ sharp color image has to be corrected . this picture has been made with a analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient lighting for the Auto @-@ Focus Lin@@ se .
&quot; for more information about the methods for the edge of the archipelago in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
&quot; the regul@@ ator smooth@@ es , the in@@ sharp@@ ness of the area was bl@@ acked , in order to generate more natural form . &quot;
&quot; the color tin@@ ts enables a customized color for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes rather than dark , then you can adjust it here . &quot;
the tool image correction is one of the most developed tool to remove the desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ qu@@ algorithm was developed by the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
&quot; this tool contains different preferences as starters , to simplify the restoration . the available preferences are listed below : &quot;
if you want to use the filter settings to a j@@ us@@ hing you can use the rider smooth@@ ing and advanced settings .
&quot; Detailed view p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to a steady smooth@@ ing over the image . a value of 0.@@ 9 should receive details so that no sharp@@ ness is needed . &quot;
&quot; ri@@ fts dependency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a little value smooth@@ es into all directions , while a value close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a movie bas@@ kets or C@@ CD Rau@@ schen will create a high value of wave @-@ similar patterns . JP@@ EG arti@@ facts are best eliminated in a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth@@ ed &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ness factor over all@@ t. p then defines the relative smooth@@ ness . therefore , use this value to the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 &#93; : this parameter is greater structures . the higher this value is set , the more it smooth@@ ed , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effect , he must be higher than 3 . &quot;
repeti@@ tions : indicates on how often the algorithm is passed through . normally there is 1 or 2 .
&quot; Winkel@@ em@@ powers as &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ine Alpha . if Alpha small chosen , it should also be small chosen . be sure that small angles can create a long term . therefore , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral parts &#91; 0,@@ 1 , 10 &#93; : integral part @-@ wide in pixel . you should put the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel glasses and never greater than 2 . &quot;
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you get through the choice of this option is only low . it doubles but the run@@ time . we recommend it to let him go out .
buttons Save as and Laden do exactly this . any setting of image errors can be saved into a text file and later loaded again .
&quot; image errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still last very long and get a high CPU load after you . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
below you can see how pic@@ tor@@ ches can be corrected using small arti@@ facts . the module is applied on a photo that is made in Guatemala City with a an@@ alog@@ ous arti@@ fact that is caused by a poor film storage during the journey . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation came ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce Bil@@ dr@@ au@@ ra , using a protected protected algorithm from Peter H@@ eck@@ ert . &quot;
&quot; this tool presents sel@@ ectable image filters to remove spots and other arti@@ facts such as dust or hair on the lens , so it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mo@@ ver ; -@@ effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information on sensor cameras from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; the scre@@ enshot above shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise , which can be successfully removed with this tool . &quot;
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub @-@ window advanced settings can remain in default settings .
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can drag the image . the area indicated by the radius is moved over the image and the color in it will be smo@@ ked , and therefore smaller bugs . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the pixel level . this value sets the pixel out to determine the filter changes . if it is lifted up , smo@@ sch@@ tips will be deleted . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter images can no longer be obtained and smo@@ k@@ eting or sc@@ rolling again . &quot;
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it &apos;s too strong can not remove the entire noise or sound tips can occur . put it on a value close to the maximum when you want to remove a wax or JP@@ EG @-@ arti@@ te without losing details .
lumin@@ ous : controls the lumin@@ ous weight of the picture . we recommend you to change color or light density to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ness that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color @-@ tolerant of the picture . we recommend you to change color or light density to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ness that is controlled by the details -@@ settings .
&quot; Gamma : controls the Gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ anz of the image . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ances of the dark areas , which are typically more dist@@ res@@ sed , but it also lubric@@ ates the shadow . &quot;
&quot; absorption : controls the adju@@ sting of the Ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ d@@ amping . this value is defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , the edges may appear too high . he can remove noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter at edges . he can remove noise and is the recommended method for this . &quot;
&quot; storing and store : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for smoking reduction you have set , can be saved into the fil@@ esystem and later loaded . &quot;
this is an example of how smoking reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the correc@@ t@@ less marked with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction has been applied with default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than one image to shar@@ pen . use the tool for soft signs with the menu @-@ yield basket and experimenting with the smooth@@ est on the right of this operation shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce phot@@ ol@@ te@@ aring tools .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your images . it is very good to appear in digital , original or in@@ toler@@ ated digi@@ ti@@ zed pictures . the smooth@@ ing is carried out along the ima@@ gery and thus gets the content as it also makes the human eye . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and texture . the text box is designed with a different tool , the image error correction , and the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ ist and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; JP@@ EG arti@@ facts reduce : the compression of JP@@ EG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compres@@ sion@@ ist salt , it creates some comp@@ utation &amp; quot ; arti@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are to be seen in un@@ compressed picture . this setting should correct these problems . &quot;
&quot; buttons Save as and Laden make exactly this . each setting of photo @-@ restoration can hereby be saved into a text file , and later loaded again . &quot;
&quot; photo rest@@ or@@ atory is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can last very long and take a high CPU load after you . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
below you can reduce like a photo with like @-@ shaped noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on a Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with an sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected below ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo @-@ restoration . this time textures was reduced to an old color photo which was used with a scanner . you can see the scan ar@@ te@@ facts that were caused by the sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and the photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the tool recovered ; tools Hot@@ pixel allows you to remove hot@@ pixel of photos with a C@@ CD camera , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project , protected by Martin Dick@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are especially noticeable in high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos as many cameras with JP@@ EG compression over a built @-@ in repression for hot pixels . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; name is pixel quot ; and &quot; quot ; light pixel &quot; ; currently there is no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file into the wizard with the button dark picture . the tool becomes visible by automatic the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture show .
if you have an old digital camera it is important to discover the dark picture directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels through C@@ CD Def@@ ects .
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should load the right dark picture to the corrected image . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard shows the last dark picture and this automatically invites you to the next meeting . &quot;
the image area and preview can help you correct the result within the image . the preview display shows the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pixels are taken into all prec@@ urs@@ ors .
select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . choose the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate this pix@@ el@@ blocks . these are the filters available :
Dur@@ ing : it will be an average of neighbouring pixel . the resulting color is assigned to all def@@ aul@@ ted pixel in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a gap of 1 from the pix@@ el@@ block will be drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the default method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block will be drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are removed to calculate a bi @-@ Cub@@ an interface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cub@@ an curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
&quot; below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with an sensitivity of 200 ISO and long expos@@ ures , applied . the original image was increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation correction is a tool for correc@@ ting the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposure corners , an image . &quot;
&quot; expan@@ sive objective , especially the middle and large photo format , can often illumin@@ ate the whole sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( sha@@ ded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light that achieves the sensor there . teleph@@ ones may also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; but he also has disadvantages . many center filters require a factor 1,5 or 2 at the Bl@@ en@@ den@@ filter that it is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . expan@@ sive objective , even with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise nonsense effects arise through motion . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure range of today &apos;s fil@@ ings and colour or gra@@ dations from digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a c@@ enter@@ filter by an equivalent correction of a c@@ enter@@ filter at an image . the algorithm is copy@@ righted by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three calculations , you can control the seal correction and with three more the exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of the largest density . the default density is 2,@@ 0 , what an optical filter with a bl@@ ending attitude of 1 , or by chance to compens@@ ate for a larger degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ osity , contrast and Gamma Settings : editing an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction , reduces the lumin@@ ance of the target image with these options . the regul@@ ator must provide you only positive values as you just have to increase settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fine new ref@@ usal of the target image , so let the values for ligh@@ ter / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of Vig@@ ie correction , applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lamp @-@ stronger and counter @-@ correction was also carried out in the picture with this tool . &quot;
the &amp; checking came ; Lin@@ sen@@ distorted is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos . it uses protected protected algorithm from David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distor@@ tions . coloured distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second gra@@ dient covers the general geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or conve@@ x form of the picture .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third gra@@ dient has a similar round @-@ effect , fla@@ p however at edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the co@@ efficient fourth gra@@ des corrected the distant corners opposed to that of the second gra@@ dient . if you combine these two can be eliminated every geomet@@ rical di@@ version , almost eliminated . &quot;
general : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion of the second gra@@ des . with negative values can be corrected and positive values of ho@@ ver@@ ted distor@@ tion .
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion of the gra@@ dient . this value works stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners &apos; parameter &apos; has the reverse parameters of the parameter . &quot;
&quot; z@@ oom : this value comple@@ ments the image size , and thereby conduc@@ ts a correction first gra@@ des through . negative values increase while positive the image smaller . &quot;
bright : this value j@@ us@@ ur@@ ts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image into the corners while positive values they increase .
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview the distor@@ tion correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used as standard values . &quot;
the ton@@ - or cus@@ hion correction should be carried out before all cuts or size changes . best perform this correction as all of the first . if you carry out a picture and carry out a ton@@ ed correction would be the effect of the wrong .
&quot; to help you find the best correction is available to you this tool a vertical and a horizontal guide line . move it to an important place , such as the ocean edge or building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . after that you can correct the ton@@ - / cus@@ hion co@@ ver@@ sive with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; when you correct a ho@@ ver@@ al distor@@ tion , the resulting image will have black fac@@ ets . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the menu transform@@ ers from image processing or via z@@ oom regul@@ ator of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; for most pictures , the ton@@ ed correction is made up . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs as e.g. recordings from the front , frames and paintings is to correct the perspective so correct that all angles in the picture 90 degrees have . note that if you hold the camera with the hand you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the ton@@ si@@ cal correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infr@@ ared film of the G@@ imp@@ gur@@ u.@@ org website which is available under this URL . the filter reproduced the famous Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ ar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity area of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left @-@ hand side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rec@@ tan@@ gle with the mouse , you can look at the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
&quot; below the preview , you can adjust two parameters to create movie bas@@ kets and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option of film bas@@ kets when you want to simul@@ ate the gran@@ ate texture of a highly sensitive movie . green meadows are white like snow ! &quot;
&quot; because of the filter channels to reproduce by infr@@ ared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the colour information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infr@@ ared fil@@ me@@ ek applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a type of au@@ ra into the shre@@ ws .
&quot; the &amp; checking came ; filter film bas@@ kets is a simple to use tool to reproduce film@@ makers on your images . this is of classic high @-@ speed films , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , known for the sensitivity of the films to mix large silver bas@@ ins of the phot@@ em@@ ul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film @-@ bas@@ kets effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated picture receives a timeless atmosphere un@@ solved by daily life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , Stre@@ et@@ ric sight especially in your mono@@ chro@@ ms photos , so you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the controller may use the ISO &apos;s sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of gra@@ ins . the default value is , although often higher values are required , on ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more gra@@ ins , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film &apos;s effect on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed ( 2 ) . the used movie sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; filters of oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; checking came ; filters of oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and styles are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the top chooses the brush size between one and five out . thicker brus@@ hes are better for big images . smo@@ ked the glasses or , from the other side , the sc@@ ul@@ arity . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and working with the ( 2 ) . twe@@ et size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and smooth@@ t@@ te 17 .
&quot; the &amp; checking came ; filter coal @-@ drawing uses coloring and Inten@@ sity gra@@ dient to change a carbon button . therefore , pictures of their gra@@ dient change slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful if you would have chosen to outline which scene you would have chosen to sc@@ ate you . this would be good pictures to start with it . &quot;
there are two regul@@ ators with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper controller sel@@ ects the foundation size and the lower j@@ us@@ ur@@ ts the contrast ( smooth@@ ing ) .
this is an example of carbon filters . the original image ( 1 ) and the altered picture ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adapting the Inten@@ sity .
&quot; the &amp; checking came ; Filter engra@@ ving your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was wi@@ red in wax . it uses protected protected algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; checking came ; Filter engra@@ ving is a fast tool to give your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . he works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure , where color does not use the most important thing . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ oton@@ ous landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the original image ( 2 ) . the depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of distor@@ ting effect . it uses copy@@ righted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave @-@ bucks 1 : divi@@ des the image in cells and lets it look as if it is seen through glass blocks .
wav@@ el@@ blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wav@@ el@@ blocks 1 the image is distorted here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can break these effects at any time with the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of un@@ sharp@@ ness effects . it uses protected algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
z@@ oom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image along st@@ ern@@ fo@@ erde lines that eman@@ ates from a center . this simul@@ ates the in@@ sharp@@ ness a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often in the sport photography .
radi@@ al un@@ sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image by rotating the pixel around a centre . this simul@@ ates the in@@ sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
distance bl@@ ur@@ ly : bl@@ ur@@ red the picture to create the effect of a not focused camera lens . the object appears to step back into the background .
&quot; motion of motion : bl@@ ur@@ red the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the in@@ sharp@@ ness of a linear moti@@ fs , z : B : from a car or by train , camera . &quot;
sof@@ tening in@@ sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this produces photos with a dre@@ amy and glos@@ sy do@@ ve effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or add a warm and subtle light . &quot;
ch@@ ills : bl@@ ur@@ red the image by random shift of pixels and simul@@ ates the in@@ sharp@@ ness of an arbitrary camera .
intelligent in@@ sharp@@ ness : finds the farms in the picture and bl@@ ur@@ red them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation anytime with the button .
reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es are a nice little tool to make reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es on your picture . this gives it natural to your images a great appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected algorithm .
&quot; trop@@ y size allows to change the size of the drop . as the dro@@ plet size does not grow automatically with the size of the picture , it is often necessary to decrease the size and density of the drop . fish changes the optical effect of drop in the image . &quot;
&quot; you can hold with the &amp; checking ; image processing an area free of reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es . use the selection tool to select the area , for example a face which should remain free . if you start afterwards the filter reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es the area will remain free of reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es Fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a peaceful sunset and the original painting ( 2 ) points a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example . &quot;
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mir@@ rors or rotating into the right orientation . you will find the tools in the menu Transform@@ ations Dre@@ w or Transform@@ ations Spi@@ der . &quot;
photo infl@@ atable is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; a picture to scale is simple . the big question is , how can you keep an image infl@@ atable and the details are sharp ? how can you re@@ invent the missing information again ? how to re@@ invent the missing information here , try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
if a photo is the wrong size you can scale it on the desired size with the tool size . select to change size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below .
&quot; the tool to change size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approach the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to infl@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; many image processing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ tization has been developed a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you need to tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider new size and are listed below :
&quot; for aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , when entering the new size , the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 &#93; : this parameter is greater structures . the higher this value is set , the more it smooth@@ ed , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effect , he must be higher than 3 . &quot;
buttons save as and loading are used accurately . each inser@@ tion for photo can be saved as a text file and later loaded again .
&quot; photo infl@@ atable is very fast with what it makes , but it can still take long and a high CPU load after you are pulling . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
&quot; you can see below an example of photo bub@@ bles , by a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enlar@@ ging the comparison . &quot;
&quot; cutting a photo is not only a frequently run operation , but also a commonly underestimated tool to make a picture . to cut a photo with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag the rec@@ tan@@ gle , you &apos;ll see this rec@@ tan@@ gle then while you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when you leave the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo will look after cutting . a new rec@@ tan@@ gle can be created by clicking it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the section , use the button code button of image processing in tool@@ bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ TR@@ L ; + X ) . use the entries file save or save in the menu file to save the newly cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the fores@@ try area , you can change the size of the rec@@ tan@@ gle by post@@ p@@ one the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue remains to be preserved . &quot;
&quot; in the mold for aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high format it will always be the larger value of the height and the width @-@ format of the width . &quot;
&quot; the tool for aspect ratio is used to cut a relative aspect ratio . that means it is always equal to whether you are centimeters , in@@ ch or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the Di@@ alo@@ ges there are two buttons to set the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
&quot; below in dialogue you can set up with the Max . ratio button to cut the area to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool to cut after aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the orientation ( Horiz@@ ont@@ ally or vertical ) . if you use the cutting tool to next time , these settings are stored as standard values depending on the orientation . the modified image measurements are reflected in the EX@@ IF data and not the original image . &quot;
the settings of the setup relief allow help to bl@@ aming your images better . these help are :
&quot; harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic parts are based on the principle of resem@@ blan@@ ce . as the third party re@@ gel , harmon@@ ic triangles are an opportunity to draw a rec@@ tan@@ gle into similar harmon@@ ic triangles with the di@@ agon@@ als . &quot;
&quot; Golden Center : the golden middle is a partition which appears on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us pussy or the leaf blades of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1.@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was already used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to make your temples and p@@ yrami@@ ds . artist and architects shared the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos together to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 ,
the golden center provides liquid aid lines at your disposal when you put together an image . these help are listed below :
&quot; the Golden Spir@@ als will bring good results for your photos closer . compared to the third party , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that leads the eye along the line of the spiral , and creates the view of this sort a sy@@ mmet@@ rical visual river . &quot;
&quot; another rule is called the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden ri@@ ots . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . this can be a line only because without the eye , it will fulfill his task . &quot;
&quot; the Golden triangles are also guided by the above @-@ discussed golden spiral . its verti@@ ces are the middle points of the sides of the golden right corner . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , Golden triangles are no equal triangles , di@@ agon@@ als can place an static object dynamic . &quot;
if you use golden triangles to break your frame create a effect of professional photographers dynamic sy@@ mm@@ etry . try to place your images on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently .
the options Horiz@@ ont@@ ologists reflect and Ver@@ tik@@ al mirror can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic pools .
&quot; with the button color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . this way you can adapt the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
free rotation is a tool to rot@@ ate a picture to any angle .
&quot; when you make a photo , then it doesn &apos;t happen that you can fix the camera exactly ver@@ tically or horizontal . this creates a picture in which the things turned around a corner . you can fix this with the &amp; D ; image processing and tool @-@ free rotation . select the free rotation and j@@ us@@ on you the target angle . &quot;
&quot; turn your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are indicated in degrees . with the button @-@ settings , you can set the sli@@ der again to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are displayed right at the top . &quot;
&quot; for your help , the module is free rotation a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the picture show to position the two lines . now , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now j@@ us@@ se the corner as described in the previous section . &quot;
&quot; once you have shot a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair is it the feature transform@@ ers from the image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the picture is the function of auto @-@ cutting . select one of the following options :
&quot; the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing smo@@ ked the image a bit after the rotation . however , please note the above warning . &quot;
all the spec@@ ulative transformations are performed around a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right of the Di@@ alo@@ ges you will find some information which help you change the perspective :
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , pixels . &quot;
&quot; new level : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , pixels . &quot;
angle left above : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle right above : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right of the transformed area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adapting the perspective the image will be a little wasted . for an individual adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
after you have adapted the perspective you get unwanted holes in the corners . one way to ber@@ some it is the picture with transform@@ ers cutting off of the image processing .
&quot; the tool is used to move a part of the picture in one direction and move the other part in the opposite direction . this is no rotation , the picture is distorted . with other words , a rec@@ tan@@ gle will be transformed into a parallel gram . you can start this module about transformations . &quot;
sc@@ iss@@ ors your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angles . you can push horizontal and ver@@ tically at the same time . a preview of the effect will display you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the viewing area .
&quot; to your help become a vertical and a horizontal line . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines in order to send your picture . &quot;
&quot; after you have carried out the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image becomes a bit mis@@ wi@@ ped out . for a single donation this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two sets are generated twice as much bl@@ ur@@ ring and hence you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after creating the image , the image has un@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . an opportunity to eliminate this is to cut the image with transform@@ ers from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; checking and digi@@ tization ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write images . therefore , the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been comp@@ iles . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , you will always see JP@@ EG and T@@ IF@@ F below . &quot;
&quot; when the extension is listed in the list , only files in the list is displayed . if the extension is listed in the list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can modify this list of file exten@@ tions . in the configuration you can find more information about this . &quot;
virtually all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JP@@ EG or T@@ IF@@ F . some cameras allow you to find even the user &apos;s used format . a more detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; sync ; supports both formats .
compression expression is the use of data compres@@ sive procedures to digital images . in doing so redund@@ ant information is reduced to save in this way the image data to a more efficient way .
&quot; JP@@ EG 2000 is also supported . in general there are better , smo@@ other results as JP@@ EG in the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version may also be los@@ ely free if this is specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the Roh@@ an format , you can read very helpful instructions in English , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Col@@ our very helpful instructions in English . in the configuration you can find further information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;

&quot; many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in Avi@@ - or MPEG @-@ Format . therefore , this formats and will look forward for the films . &quot; &quot; when you click on a movie file , the &amp; k@@ ies ; settings for playing movies to start playing the program to play . &quot;

many tools you need to get the photo processing are available in &amp; checking ; their description follows here .
&quot; all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ens , soft signs , smoke @-@ sup@@ pl@@ ating , re@@ focus , bl@@ ur@@ red mask , and etc . use a single dialog box , which shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current picture . below you see &amp; quot ; texture App@@ lic@@ quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progres@@ sives shows the status of the filter to the current picture . links from him allow five buttons to change the comparative mode of the pre@@ man@@ age@@ way . these modes include :
vertical parts without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area right of the chosen presentation area .
horizontal without dup@@ licate . the upper range shows the original and the lower displays the filter applied to the range below the selected selection range .
vertical parts . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal . the upper range shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
mouse over &apos; style : show the preview when the mouse is not in the fores@@ try area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons which you can turn on to show over@@ - and exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can disc@@ ard this frame with the mouse within the picture and drop it on the part of the picture from which you can see . preview in the left part of dialogue is instantly updated .
( 5 ) : in the left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the side@@ bar properties tab shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely explained itself . it is grouped in the following sections :
photo features : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data are from EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this rider presents an intuitive dealer @-@ search tool based on the side@@ wheel mini@@ ature program . you can press C@@ TR@@ L ; lin@@ ker mouse button to pull a square . all pictures inside this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course this requires your images ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for p@@ allets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and to choose and burning colours .
&quot; the p@@ allets files , which are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ ies ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and har@@ med colors . &quot;
&quot; in a dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed p@@ allets or browse the folder . &quot;
the cursor is displayed in the palm view as a line . it can be moved by clicked on the area next to a color .
it shows the colour next to it . the color is described below the palm view . here the color name can also be changed .
&quot; it can also be used to choose . to create such a choice , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor to it . then move the mouse with pressing left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check field Bei@@ m C@@ ursor inserted under the button color , the color is inserted from the color panel on the cursor . the color is either inserted or transferred one other ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write mode is selected . this mode can be set by selecting the check field under Bei@@ m C@@ ursor . &quot;
&quot; a selection which has been created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions , merge and inser@@ ting them . &quot;
&quot; use the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional colour name , followed by a poin@@ ter sign , if a further color follows . therefore , these can be inserted as one color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit . &quot;
the colors in the palette and output of color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
&quot; choose a color somewhere on the screen , and then you can find it on the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
&amp; k@@ graph@@ ene ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot . graphs are used in science and especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs &amp; x@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .

&amp; k@@ graph@@ ene ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ ies ; - program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graphs in &amp; Kate ; representing the graphs and in &amp; k@@ graph@@ ene ; represent )
menu to open the graphs in &amp; Kate ; open or the graphs in &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; in a &amp; Kate ; -@@ component to open
loading of big graph ( currently there are problems starting about 1000 knot@@ s and a h@@ ack to present more than these no@@ des )
further needed software : &amp; k@@ graphical inter@@ viewer ; is a &amp; b ; program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ ite ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs . required in detail :
&quot; the main window shows the opened graph , each in its own sub @-@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ ene ; without an argument , the tool@@ bar contains only the symbol file and the ( blank ) list of last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the lower screen photo : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is bigger than the string . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; mouse @-@ wheel use ( high and down without any special , left and right in pressing &amp; Alt ; button ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor 10 . below you see the maximum narro@@ wer of a graph .
&quot; if the file was just changed in &amp; k@@ graph@@ ene ; loaded file from another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the Grap@@ h is to be re@@ charged or whether you want to ignore the change . if you want to change your decision later , you can set up your decision later , you can set up the menu item ( graphic viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; if you open an graph@@ end@@ ate@@ i outside a current &amp; k@@ graph@@ ite ; instance , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphic viewer , or want to present the graph in a sub@@ window of the already ongoing instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the dialog dialog . &quot;
&quot; in the program start , you can open all the graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both and later . &quot;
you can also define how the Grap@@ h is to be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages may be freely chosen .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph are to be displayed on this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled from the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
page show with one to several pages distributed graphs without head@@ line and with a different font .
&quot; the site again is available to specify the behavior if a file has been modified at the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behaviour ( automatically re@@ charging or ignore the changes ) or the program each time . &quot;
&quot; the page opening gives the possibility to set the behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph@@ ene ; to specify , if an Grap@@ h can be opened outside a current session . you can open a standard behavior for this case ( the graphs in a new window , or set in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time you are asked . &quot;
the site management gives the possibility to set the launch behavior of &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; you can set a default behaviour ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine when starting afterwards .
&quot; the context menu , which usually occurs during a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; it opens up more options : &quot;
here you can choose among various &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as they are described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm calcul@@ ating the standard for specific graph . the algorithm puts edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge @-@ cuts as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ eri@@ zed graph . he produces depic@@ tions in accordance with the spr@@ ing@@ board model . thereby the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wai @-@ algorithm uses that the syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimension@@ ing sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm generates for un@@ eri@@ ed graphs a spr@@ ing@@ y model of the layout . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold @-@ He@@ ur@@ istics . it contains a multi @-@ pron@@ u@@ cle@@ ft for the treatment of large and ge@@ clu@@ stered graph .
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm calcul@@ ates the knot@@ s circular according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of several multi @-@ cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog , where you can specify a layout command , which will then be executed by a shell . the command should give Graph@@ end@@ ate@@ i as parameters , and change the calculated layout of the graph@@ .@@ to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . using such a layout , you can also change the graphs with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
determines the type of grap@@ hing ( directed or un@@ eri@@ ti@@ tious ) and uses the standard algorithms for each type ( dot ; for specific , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph ) . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is enabled , the overview is displayed , if it is necessary . otherwise it is not displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
shows the What is the mouse cursor . click with this mouse cursor to a &amp; GUI ; element to get further help on this item ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available under this address and in the boot folder of the source code .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ ene ; is a &amp; k@@ ies ; -@@ program that uses the &amp; graph@@ ite ; tools for display . it requires the following programs :
a special facility is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graph@@ ene ; to use in the menu settings you will find further options .
&quot; the main window of the editor is divided into five areas : the main tool@@ bar , the box for character tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette , and the grid network , in which you draw the symbol . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I module images read tools available to read new images and to record them .
&quot; this module can be used to read and delete new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used : &quot;
&quot; images scan : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the SAN@@ E project or other source , such as video streams . so that this works you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and SAN@@ E . &quot;
&quot; when you scan the menu entry , a dialog which allows you to choose between all available sources on your computer . choose the source from which you want to get the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will be able to replace one &apos;s default duc@@ ting ones in order to select your picture according to you . check the picture in the right , bottom corner . the estimated file size will be shown in the right , bottom corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka hand@@ book you will find more information . &quot;
&quot; be sure that the window will be displayed completely , since some settings will not be displayed . &quot;
&quot; after you have pushed the scanning button , you have to wait until the scan completed and the window to set up the options of the target file . here you can choose the compression and type of image file . you also need to select the compression and type of image file . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image saved . &quot;
screen@@ caps you can create after you have selected in the menu impor@@ tier@@ - &gt; scre@@ enshot ... a window appears in which you can set the different screen@@ phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
&quot; select The complete desktop , in order to read a single window under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if all your own program window is selected , the call program will disappear , so you can read other screens and windows . otherwise , you will read , after a short delay , the currently visible work place . if you choose the complete desktop , the window will be read under the mouse . &quot;
the delay determines how long scre@@ enshot will wait before it starts . if you have to switch to other work@@ space you should select this delay high enough to navigate the time there .
&quot; once the scre@@ enshot is made , the dialog Options of the target image has been made with the options described above . &quot;

&quot; Flickr is an online photograph on the internet . with Flickr it is possible to send his photos to the people who are important . you can show your favourite photos of the world , show the photos of your cam@@ ah@@ and@@ ys online and show your photos and private your friends and family all over the world . &quot;
the export @-@ export module to Flickr can be used to upload pictures from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet .
&quot; if you use the module for the first time , you will use the process of recovery of a Tok@@ ens . thus , it is used for your authentication . a browser is started , so that you can register with Flickr . &quot;
&quot; after the successful login , the module can send photos to the Flickr website . you will be presented the following page after a successful login . &quot;
&quot; just close the browser window and return to the program back . after you have pushed on Yes , you get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr . this will appear in the next section . &quot;
&quot; when the export module is started on Flickr to the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which indicates the current access per@@ missions . for up@@ loading , you will also need any other per@@ missions . you will currently need any other per@@ missions . you will be asked whether you want to continue with these per@@ missions . &quot;
the button photos should add once more once you have set all the other options . with this button you can select in a file op@@ box the photos you want to upload . if you press on the O@@ k button you will download the high @-@ load photos to the Flickr Server .
the keywords Field can be filled with a separated list of words . these are added to the image as a keywords during up@@ lad@@ ing .
&quot; with the options aper@@ ingly , friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie you can adjust the access per@@ missions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as private . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the option to adjust the size of the photos before the up@@ loading , the photos are changed before the high load in size . the size is taken from the value added at the maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum amount of images . the size is so changing that the aspect ratio remains constant .

to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ For@@ mat@@ . g@@ p@@ s@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ p@@ sman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can result a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track .
&quot; select the pictures you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and then call the menu . up to see a possible correlation of time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data from the same time in the same places as the images of your camera . &quot;
when the file is loaded a automatic correlation is performed by the coordinates in red . GPS trace data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera has to be implemented with the GMT . this can be done with the time@@ zone .
&quot; the adjustment for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS @-@ time and camera initiative . if the devi@@ ation among them is merged , the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if you have no trace dates from one place for pictures , you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference between 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this field . &quot;
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in min. can be used if you don &apos;t have adequate data . if you know that in reality a loc@@ alization is placed in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can put these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ishing . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful when you notice a number of photos in the same place . since the dialogue will notice the coordinates of a call to the next , you only need to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; loc@@ ating can also be found and set by the shown map and enlarge it . select the relevant region and enlarge it si@@ e.@@ filling this again and again . the map must always be selected manually . the map can always be switched between map mode , satellite picture and a mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely out of the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script using the ex@@ i@@ f@@ tool to provide a stack of images with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
&quot; this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums which are to be exported as HTML pages , and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the fonts will enable UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best internation@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; the module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted . the rider choice allows all the albums to choose to be exported to HTML . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area underneath will appear the table show and the text that appear in the header page . &quot;
&quot; the rider image defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this rider is largely expl@@ ain@@ able . the option for each image will create a page in which the picture will display . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard screen , &amp; eg ; cu@@ ck@@ show , displayed . &quot;
&quot; the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your related pictures . select a folder that contains the name of K@@ IP@@ I@@ so@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JP@@ EG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original pictures will also be stored in the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the standard color depth . of course , the file size also influences the file size . all other settings are explic@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the rider preview images allows you to show some of the settings from the album rider for the preview pictures , which are small pictures that are shown in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user on how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to break down the process .
&quot; if the module has created the pages , the window will not automatically shut down . you can therefore run the program@@ ing to determine if errors during production occurred . the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery . press closing to lock the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I portrait is a very fast and flexible OpenGL tool to look at pictures .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I picture considers it to view a selection of pictures and to perform basic operations such as rotation , zo@@ oming or shifting . the viewer can be used with short@@ cut and scroll . it was developed for quick browsing and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after starting , a picture is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JP@@ EG loss @-@ free module is a tool to change images without blocking your quality .
&quot; this module allows to save for the promotions listed below , images in the JP@@ EG format without the usual losses of quality and met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size is rising , since no compression of colour information is taking place . this is also reflected in the P@@ NG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client still has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I Teams under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. for the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module met@@ adata Editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the import and function of the met@@ adata module you can copy data from one image to another , and then call on the import function , so the image to which you want to copy the met@@ adata . the data will be copied after you have pushed the button OK . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not into any target format . JP@@ EG is supported by writing . please check ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ electric module is a tool to convert a number of pictures into a MPEG video in the form of a slide .
&quot; the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer &apos;s module can be used to convert selected pictures into a MPEG video , using a defined length , using a defined length . you can add a base screen . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or W@@ AV of the Di@@ asch@@ au . &quot;
all pictures are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . additionally you can create a background color for the slide . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XV@@ CD / SV@@ CD / SV@@ CD / SV@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
&quot; first , you must first select the pictures that will be packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . after that , you can start to create the module about Ex@@ tras MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . &quot;
&quot; the images you selected are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there , you can also change sor@@ ting the pictures and the content of the list . &quot;
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should choose the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , XV@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . PAL is default , and most probably the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step you should indicate the time in seconds the one image will be displayed . a lower value creates very sudden , a high contrast , very smooth image change . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . the name and path of the created file can be set to the name of the MPEG output file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , then it is integrated into the movie . depending on the speed of your machine , you can now move with the button to drink a coffee and enjoy the di@@ gest when you &apos;re back . &quot;
&quot; if an indication appears that co@@ effici@@ ents or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the button settings right below . &quot;
the printing job allows it to print several images on a piece of paper together in standard phot@@ o@@ ad sizes . this combination images can also be opened automatically with the image processing . this is e.g. use@@ fully to print you or to print with the Gimp module .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import and convert your images stored in one of three formats JP@@ EG , T@@ IF@@ F or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command @-@ tool d@@ cra@@ w of Dave Coff@@ in . an original version of Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ v not that it generates the same results , as the software from your comra@@ de . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ v . &quot;
&quot; first select the RA@@ W file that is to be converted , and start the module . the rap @-@ image window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the button preview , you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture . &quot;
you can now optimize the values new j@@ us@@ um to optimize the conver@@ gence process . the primary parameters such as Gamma , brightness and Red / Blue amplifier can be used . if the result is not optimal you can edit the image later . &quot;
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so that you can use the contra@@ sting information . if your camera is working in R@@ GB mode the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JP@@ EG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; tagged Image Format , T@@ IF@@ F , retains all the information of your image and uses the loss of free L@@ Z@@ W com@@ compression . &quot;
&quot; if you intend to frequently edit your images or otherwise you should not choose to use the JP@@ EG format , as there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality worsen@@ ed . T@@ IF@@ F and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you can choose the EC as a storage format , the met@@ adata that included in the RA@@ W file are stored in the JP@@ EG file in the EX@@ IF data . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings you can start using the conversion button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use it . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert different pictures at one time . use this mode so if you are sure , for example by testing a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ ride the existing file automatically . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
&quot; this module can be used to comp@@ ress all pictures in an album , using the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following images are supported : &quot;
&quot; this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of a album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start and tim@@ est@@ amp of the record . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can scale or enlarge the image :
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size variation in a dimension . width or height of the picture is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size variation in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format . &quot;
&quot; not proportional : not dis@@ proportionate size change in two dimensions , the aspect ratio is changed in this option . &quot;
&quot; print preparation : preparing the image for the photo printing . the user can adjust the print solution and the size of the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ iers . the target picture , including background size , size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly . &quot;
using this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your favorite email program . it is also possible to change the size of the additional images before . further pictures can be drawn to the list of images and drop there .
&quot; after which you started the module , the pictures window will be displayed with the pictures you have selected . add additional images to the button . for the last selected image , a preview is displayed on the right . &quot;
you can also drag images to the picture list and take there to add some pictures to the list .
&quot; with the button pictures , the selected images will be removed from the list of images published . &quot;
after you have selected all pictures you can open the new message -@@ window of your e @-@ mail clients with the button OK . you just need to add the addresses and the bed . the pictures selected are already attached .
do not pay attention to many pictures at one time . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of the sent e @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and every@@ time use it until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you have to specify the right path for your installation in the input field . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail@@ agent on your machine . you can download it here . &quot;
after the selection of comments in an attached file add comments to the pictures in a text file attached and the mail attached .
&quot; the P@@ NG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to the loss of free formats such as T@@ IF@@ F . therefore , you should therefore have P@@ NG . otherwise we recommend you the JP@@ EG format . &quot;
&quot; if you can select file format among images file format and the original files in the JP@@ EG format are , then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to sen@@ i@@ xed images . &quot;
&quot; if the process is ready , the window will not automatically shut down , so you can view the status of status , in search of errors , however . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . with the button &quot; Close &quot; you can lie down this window . &quot;
&quot; after the launch of the module advanced D@@ ash@@ au , a window with questions like you want your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the option OpenGL transi@@ tions in presentation use very elegant sc@@ aling using OpenGL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphics card because otherwise the slides can be very slow . &quot;
&quot; the fil@@ en@@ ame option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of images displayed in the lower left corner , during the presentation . &quot;
the loop option ensures that the presentation will appear in a final loop . you can manually cancel it with Es@@ c .
the option images random@@ ly select that the pictures are shown in random order . so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album .
&quot; under delay between images can be the tempor@@ al distance between the individual pictures . 1500 mill@@ ise@@ con@@ ds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your machine and your chosen transition effect . so you should so@@ ak this before you show your friends ! &quot;
there are more than a dozen transition effects among which you can choose . by chance choosing a different effect on every transition between images .
&quot; during the Di@@ asch@@ au , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left side of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn it on . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the screen , you can view the current file name , position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; dates currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I Teams under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. for the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the working surface .
&quot; this module is currently using selected image , depending on the selected option of sub@@ menu , as a background for your K@@ DE work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with comments , you can talk with &amp; C@@ photo@@ album ; through this browser , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , then in individuals , places and in group sampling entries are available . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your pictures and videos with comments . additionally , there are entries to look at your hard disk and to view the current preview pictures . in the following , each one is described for itself . &quot;
&quot; when you press the mouse to the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
if you select another person only the images are shown on which both persons are shown . by this selection method you can restrict the number of images shown from a few thousand images to some single images .
&quot; if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can view images to look at the images of your area . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol before their name . you can save on &amp; photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own preview image , that is of course also for places , keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself . see this picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images beside the name , select the button that you want to use the right outside on the tool@@ bar . in the appearing context menu , you can select which view you can display for each category separately ( if you have no suitable pictures for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you need to define yourself which picture should be displayed for each individual person . now , you can select a categories editor , as shown in the picture . here you can select the image factor according to your wishes and select which part of the picture shall be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the entry window in the main window , a dialogue will be displayed , which is very similar to the dialog for the capture of the image properties . this dialogue can be seen on the picture again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string in the box or description , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of images can be searched for this text , so for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all pictures after specific names as you can see in the picture . here , according to pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you do not like reading hand@@ books , but rather prefer to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and look at the quick @-@ up , the screen@@ caps and the introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; launch &amp; C@@ photo@@ album ; and select in the first dialog the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select in the menu Help menu item on photo@@ photo ; -@@ demo . then , some example images are loaded and you can test the functions of &amp; photo@@ album ; &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this hand@@ book , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as an associated HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar shows here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you data statistics about the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . each bar shows a different unit . you can switch between the units of months , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you see a part of a database by clicking the box only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline you can use the following ways inter@@ actively use : you can select the shown entries view from the database ( if you select a date , the time bar shows you the current date of the currently shown images when you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by clicking the mouse button down and select the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ ings , are shown in the preview view only pictures of this period . you can break the selection by clicking on a beam of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&amp; C@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with two ways to create HTML websites with your images . the one is integrated in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other as module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; C@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version which you can create through the HTML File menu .
&quot; before HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following , each area is described more accurately . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the display and a description which should contain the HTML file later . on photo@@ photo ; HTML example pages you will see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , choose whether a &amp; photo@@ photo album ; export file should be created on the page page . nutritional information about export files can be found in . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages . thus , you can avoid that information is displayed on the viewer . for example , that all pictures are from a party . note that all pictures are exported from a party . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain pictures before certain watching . &quot;
&quot; in this area , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are clear , which is not specifically received . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the pictures . thus , those who have to look at your website and possess a monitor that supports maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images download such as a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the spect@@ ator of your site can change the resolution at any time you have defined . thus , it can search your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission period . if he wants to get a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , you place the different folders and the URL where your website is saved . &quot;
&quot; best to choose from all your HTML files , select a base folder and for each subsequent set a new sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; first , you must select the main folder in which all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and select the location next time . here you can choose either a folder or a folder protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; once you have created your pictures , you can check if this really is all visible for viewers . if you select for the basic folder , a web browser , after the pages have been created , this folder should be . otherwise the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files still does not exist in the final target folder , you need to manually copy it to the final destination . this is not the sub@@ folder of the files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ directories are . &quot;
&quot; the just described settings can be referred to all three based folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder created , whose name you define in output folders . &quot;
&quot; if you are interested in a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to create an HTML @-@ page for viewing the pictures . if you already have a lot of time for viewing the images , reception , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; C@@ photo@@ album ; this work doesn &apos;t even have to do . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the images are used with ex@@ - and imported . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in it , whether the images are stored in the file , or whether in the file only a link to pictures is that you have all the images together and that file can be distributed as independent . however , the obvious draw@@ back is the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can assign a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu File Export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file together with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file is looking for the pictures in two times . first , the pictures are not found in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . the respective images are not found , so this is only possible if you created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for the export of pictures is described , which you can export via the export menu ... &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be an internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
&quot; when you copy manual to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the pictures in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with the Autom@@ atic option to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you . &quot;
&quot; files are normal Zi@@ p files . since most of the pictures have already been compressed with JP@@ EG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want this yet , simply select the option export file . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size . if you send your friends pictures , you might want to send the pictures maybe not in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file might not be great . here you can limit the size by saying that each image is up to 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ in from the web browser or from the menu File Import ... , , &amp; C@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described . &quot;
&quot; the assistant to imports is made up of four steps . first , you must select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the import pictures are to be copied . &quot;
&quot; it can be that you are person@@ alize the category person of person@@ alizing file person@@ er ( if you are a sw@@ ans ) while this category is asked for your database . therefore , you are asked in the third dialog window , which categories which are to be imported in your database and which categories will suit them in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can get the categories of imported file remot@@ ely with the categories of your current database . one example can be seen on the picture . &quot;
&quot; it has to be simple to search and view images : if you see images , you often want to see images in different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you are looking for example pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your boyfriend , you may want to see all pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will undergo the different steps from ( 1 ) capture the information about your images , about ( 2 ) the search and appearance , through to ( 3 ) advanced themes and adap@@ t@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Phot@@ o@@ album was started as a program for administration of your pictures . however , it has been expanded and nowadays it takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual , pictures have spoken about pictures , but often it also closes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; &amp; C@@ photo@@ album ; saves all its information in the file inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml in the top folder of her pictures . this is a simple XML file that you can secure with a program of your choice , e.g. standardization tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy disk or revisions in CVS . &quot;
&quot; if you want to read the folder in which your images are stored and used it automatically again at future start . if you want to read another folder @-@ tree with images , so you can launch a different folder @-@ tree with images , so you can launch a different folder @-@ tree ; as example : photo@@ photo -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; on the menu entry settings , photo@@ album ; set up ... you will be able to change a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , the different settings options will be explained . &quot;
&quot; links you can see six different symbols , with which you can view settings for viewing and viewing the options for the viewer . for each setting , an extensive help is available to access the F1 button and click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; it was described in you how to create different properties for each image , e.g. individuals , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as items , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; to see the dialog , which is used to process existing groups already . for each available group you can select a cap@@ tion and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section , sub@@ categories are mentioned already . in dialogue options you can set full members of members , i.e. , for example , all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a type of membership . &quot;
&quot; in view of the settings options available to you , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window you can select the list with the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&amp; C@@ photo@@ album ; shares his module system with other graphics applications such as digi@@ ti@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . nutritional information can be found on the home page of Ki@@ pi .
&quot; the modules can be accessed via the menu modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; photo@@ album ; however , but most modules have a help page that you can call through the modules itself . &quot;
&quot; because the modules are used together with each other among each other , it can be that the modules with &amp; C@@ photo@@ album ; demo database can always be tested first with the demo database ; demo database you can use either via the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . do not say , I would not have warned you ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I have been very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; don &apos;t work . this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications can &apos;t use their pictures in albums : this kind of order does not support , simul@@ ates it for some modules the order of albums so you can use the functions with &amp; C@@ photo@@ album ; &quot;
&quot; thereby simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is simple to the current view , i.e. all pictures that show you the picture show at the moment . &quot;
&quot; next to the current album , &amp; C@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also has to pass a list of albums . here goes on &amp; photo@@ album ; as follows : &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will have the category that you have defined in the settings dialog as category for virtual albums , so if you are using the category individuals , this is called &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album , so whether you would have chosen persons to view this and share this module . &quot;
&quot; because some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible can you remove them from the list of modules . launch the dialog dialog , and select the modules that are to be loaded . &quot;
&quot; on the picture , you will see an example of a start@@ screen , once you &amp; C@@ photo@@ album , start with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , take a look at the top of a menu - and a tool@@ bar . at the moment , it does not contain a lot of information , as you do not see any information about your pictures . in the section we will show you some information on this window , which shows you an overview of all existing images . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to add any picture with comments . this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture , etc . you can put each image either individually or for a larger number of images to put certain notes at the same time . if for example on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures taken in Copenhagen . &quot;
&quot; all these comments can be used for finding and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these notes , if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; see three lists with a text box by setting persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you will always use them again when you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is to reloc@@ ate the pictures inside the list : if you have a family celebration and shown on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can find that the used names are moved upwards to find the people faster and assign . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sor@@ ting by date below the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected comments for each image individually , you may want to edit all selected pictures and put these pictures with notes . in this case , simply click on the front and back buttons , which are shown on the right side of the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images , e.g. using the same person , then it can be more comfortable to mark all these pictures and provide the menu item multiple entries at once using a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . furthermore , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot;
&quot; in the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is an over@@ group , a special icon will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the starter catalogue , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also add an entry to a category and disc@@ ard it to make this one sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this is ahead that you can just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; you can shift the individual elements of the feature di@@ alogues by clicking the box that form the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make a separate window by moving it outside the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the look of the window so to your needs , you can click on the button Options ... , which offers you the possibility to store the current structure and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also leave a frame completely out . if you want to see this window again later , use the button Options ... and here you can see the window . this will see you in the picture . &quot;
&quot; when you choose the entry images in the browser , you will receive an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures , or all the pictures in case you have no filter . one example can be found here . you can configure the size of the preview images , by simply drop down the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it simple . &quot;
&quot; when you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture is set up as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; when you click on a picture , this picture is displayed in the picture . if you have not yet opened a window with a viewing view , a new display window will be created . &quot;
you can also delete pictures in the picture show . simply select the appropriate pictures from which you want to delete and press either the removal button or select in the menu Edit selection . now the window will appear you can see in the picture .
&quot; you can also use this problem for this problem . you can also use the images stored on your hard disk . of course , you need to have pictures saved somewhere , so &amp; C@@ photo@@ album ; in the picture you see the view of &amp; C@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; pictures in which the right upper corner is cut off , however , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the preview images exist ; however , you can view these pictures with the view . &quot;
&quot; as you see , this feature takes you to copy files from the folders and ask them again . so if you want to avoid any hass@@ les on how to avoid penetration of your images , please buy a larger hard disk in order to store all images on it . &quot;
&quot; in the menu images you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , you filter the images so that at the end of those who want you to see for others and click on updating . &quot;
&quot; in order that you have determined which pictures in the case of the case shall be hidden . if you lock the laptop with your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , where all pictures you have blocked . if you want to get the pictures again , click on Sper@@ re . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered into the images . to set up this password , simply select a password in the menu privacy . &quot;
&quot; keep in mind that this picture protection is by no means safe . for one you are able to access the inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml file , read the password as un@@ encrypted text , or delete it . this type of password protection is only for those who are using &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to rep@@ el the look at private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you manage all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and hours over hours for you to describe is natural that you want to look at them sometime . for this reason , &amp; photo@@ album ; for this reason , you can preview image as described in . &quot;
&quot; the viewer can see you in . of course , he shows the picture , but additional all the information you enter about the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ box is on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can simply drag them with your mouse and drop elsewhere . you can also configure which information is displayed and if all information is displayed after a right click on the viewer . all these options can be seen below . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ box are underlined . if you click on this browser , see the right entries to this view . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected individuals from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and go back by using the buttons image high and image . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also accessible from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when several images are loaded in the viewer , you can let them run as di@@ asch@@ au . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often there is a new image can be checked by pressing the Str@@ ong Taste and Plus or minus . it will be stopped by the buttons C@@ TR@@ L ; S . &quot;
&quot; a very useful skill of the be@@ holder of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , it is used to switch in full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer is using the complete place on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back . &quot;
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can get into the picture and get zo@@ oming . with the mouse button , you can get out the Plus button zo@@ om@@ t in the middle of the picture . shows how a z@@ oom rec@@ tan@@ gle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the point button you can reset your z@@ oom , so that the image is not shown to be zo@@ omed . with the simultane@@ est places the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel is equivalent to a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zo@@ om@@ operations that work on videos will work in and zo@@ oming with the plus and wild@@ est .
with the screen@@ functions from the context menu you can rot@@ ate the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it may happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can view the check and configuration dialog of the picture to give it . but you will perhaps prefer to look at the picture and see further pictures .
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer , to see the pictures on paper . to see what photos you want to start the viewer with the pictures and select them as good or bad while you look at one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the spect@@ ator gives you the possibility to view images with characteristics while you view it . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can put a characteristic by pressing the appropriate letter . in view a picture where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have characteristics set on your images , they are available in your browser . so you can view all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected pictures on a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can display in the view view . if you display categories in a view view , you can add characteristics to the images by simply press the letters for the feature after the picture was selected . you can see this here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you &amp; photo@@ album allows you to paint on the picture .
&quot; the mixture is not stored with the image , but in the database . on the way you can re@@ vert your gem@@ old later . &quot;
in you can see a picture on the painted album . to switch the painting mode from the context menu . to end the painting from the context menu . to end the M@@ alen press just hit the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to control the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . not fully dominate but the documentation on &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , you should necessarily read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can select single objects . then their properties are displayed in the properties properties and display the object in the wire @-@ wire views yellow . &quot;
you can also select multiple objects simultaneously . but not the object of an already selected object since all sub@@ objects have already been selected with the object .
&quot; to add a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are multiple possible positions , the following re@@ boot menu is to select , so that you can choose the right position : &quot;
&quot; with del@@ eting either from the menu bar below edit or from the menu @-@ menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene before . &quot;
&quot; if you have modified properties , click on the application to take these changes . if you entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with a error description . then you can click on the input errors , or use the changes to break down . &quot;
&quot; when you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation in the furnishings dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the requested object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 contains already the user &apos;s documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview a preview in Fe@@ atur@@ es@@ View view . &quot;
&quot; press a preview in Fe@@ atur@@ es@@ View and a small example of the scene will be made with the chosen texture . as an adjustment , the entire texture is ri@@ pped , even if you want a sub@@ ordin@@ ated item ( for example , a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture Map ) , crossing locally . &quot;
the scre@@ enshot shows the check@@ points of the camera . you can drag this check@@ points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the check@@ points and it will appear a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift through pulling with the mouse within the whole window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a visual level of visibility . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object , or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected or their visibility of visibility is smaller or equal to the scene which are shown in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window order as default . the object tree and view of the lens properties are left to the left and the four graphic views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window , or if you need any other order , you can set them to any number . you can also save multiple windows arrangements and easily switch between different formations . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or under any view , drag the f@@ water to the top or bottom of a view . a rec@@ tan@@ gle shows then the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to over@@ turn multiple views over one another , drag the An@@ f@@ ater in the middle of another view . you can then switch between views through clicking on the card &apos;s top in the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window order are flo@@ ated views : views that are not embedded in the main window . to det@@ ach a view from the anchor , drag the f@@ water to the desktop or click on the small to the left side of the arrow bar . &quot;
&quot; to view a view , click on the small cross in the board bar . to prevent the closing , click the small square between arrow and the cross . &quot;
you can insert additional views on the main window . in the menu View you will find entries for each type of views . new views are web@@ based , you can anchor them in any place . &quot;
&quot; you can save the current window view ... save it . it will display a dialogue in which you can save the window , under an existing or new name . &quot;
&quot; if you created a scene , you can ren@@ ders it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ ders , this program has to be properly installed . when this manual was written in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 does not support . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ ders the current scene , click on the icon Ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the menu @-@ entry view scene . &quot;
&quot; a R@@ ender mode is equivalent to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of the ren@@ ders . if you want to add a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full pictures of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; when you click on the icon The R@@ ender settings in tool@@ bar , or in the menu View R@@ ender modes ... select , the following dialogue will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can input any name , but it is a name that lets you identify the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the card size , you can enter the width and height of the left image . if you want to ren@@ ds just a small area of the picture , select the panel section , and give the image cut into the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in the combination field quality , you can select the properties that uses &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; for ren@@ ders . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflections . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the user hand@@ book to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . &quot;
&quot; when a picture with only a beam decreases pixels , different errors can arise . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or co@@ ver@@ effect in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called Ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally see pictures with this property better .
&quot; if you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing , be calculated and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than a beam of pixels . this technique is called Super sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of the super sampling . as a standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because each pixel is still further divided and adap@@ tive because the re@@ curve sti@@ ffs is dependent on the calculated color values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray moves a beam depending on pixels . if you adjust the difference between the color values to the neighboring pixels , both pixels will be calculated by the pursuit of a certain extra number of pixel with super sampling , then a grid of 4x@@ 4 additional points will be calculated , with a low level of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams je pixels . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
dense = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays depending on pixels . when the difference between colour values exceeds the pre @-@ defined threshold , the pixels will be monitored in 4 sub @-@ pixels , which can be individually pursued and checked for further sub @-@ classification . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the low level . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is that the production of smo@@ other for the beam process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn j@@ it@@ tering , changes &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the final setting for the quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property .
&quot; on this card , you can adjust whether the Alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the associated beams have no object hit . &quot;
&quot; open a new window for viewing the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , you can find the reason here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , select the menu entry file import ... and select a file in the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers , not yet the complete command of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; if in the import error messages or warnings , a dialog window shows a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support code text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source text between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
&quot; you can export objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . this adds to the source text of the object to import the text file in the editor , simply highlight the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree . &quot;
&quot; with copying and inser@@ ting in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert code text for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , also . &quot;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a Sc@@ ene ren@@ ders . usually this is Po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ Po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; when you click on help in the peculi@@ arity view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; users &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation for the indicated object . place here the path to your documents and version . supported the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; looking for external files ( for example al@@ timeter / Po@@ v@@ ray ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you draw files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also use the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the check@@ points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the color of the rec@@ tan@@ gle for the field view in the camera view and in the window type passwords .
&quot; you can set the object @-@ catch of points on the R@@ aster in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set up the r@@ aster separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation . &quot;
&quot; greater values give a more accurate wire model and thus better approxim@@ ation for the shown objects , but require more time to return . for some objects such as the sphere , you can adjust the detail stage for two directions . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the High Report Statement for extended proj@@ ections , all wire model views are further divided , when the camera uses an extended projection . this property results in better approach for proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; in a wall box , a wall behind the objects will be stre@@ amed . the wall is shown in a chess bre@@ tt@@ pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; when you display soil , a bottom is controlled below the objects . the floor is shown in a chess bre@@ tt@@ pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; if you are activ@@ ating the edge @-@ lifting method , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method used for the ren@@ ders of the scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be set . more precise information about the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender modes . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can modify existing window formations or create new window formations . in the section window formations , you can create and save window formations . &quot;
the use field standard window : displays all the existing window formations . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used the selected window @-@ order of the start of the program .
&quot; the list of existing window instruments shows all available window acts . a new arrangement , you can create with the button &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; and delete a selected arrangement with the button . &quot;
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and may not be empty .
&quot; the list under the name shows all views of the selected window order . new views can be created with the button &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; and delete selected views with the button . &quot;
&quot; the position of the new window . with new column create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ ts you anchor the window under the existing window , with cart@@ on card , you get a card @-@ card view together with the previous view and de@@ cip@@ ating the view not in the main window , but creates a comfor@@ ted window . &quot;
&quot; so you just have &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you would like to follow without more exact knowledge of the two programs . if you want to follow all steps in this guide , you should very popular the Ultimate scene at beginners : a bul@@ let at one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should note the following warnings carefully before you complain that you as a result only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you have no camera set , no rules for ren@@ ders can be applied as a result you get a black image . &quot;
&quot; when you insert no light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you have everything faul@@ ty installed , take a look at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following presented window : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read documentation , so that you can get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you &apos;ll need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu entry deposit . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene which you generate . in particular you notice the image in the fourth wire model ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the designation Camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view lens , in which the different parameters of the camera will be found . in the user &apos;s documentation on &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , you will find further details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is later reserved , but note that the camera in view points can change . simply click with the left mouse button on a check@@ point and drag it to the desired place . &quot;
&quot; when you apply the button or press the input key , the wire model views and the object tree immediately change these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could insert for example a qu@@ ader ( inser@@ ting body Qu@@ ader ) and size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an easy way to solve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offers in fact a simplified possibility . you can use an infinite level as soil :
&quot; a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and press the button . in the object tree the new name is displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view now shows the plain , albeit at the moment only as a limited state level . if you ren@@ ds the scene , the level stretches up to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the object tree carefully , you will find that you click on the item + in front of the object . in this case you will find only the default options for every new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the lens properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should shift the ground to exercise a unit among the horizon line , only to get to know some of these parameters . select shifting and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the ground in order to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a little stream at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases a dialog opens , where you can select how the object should be inserted . please select the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview , see how the pig@@ ment looks right now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments shows only a matt black material because you need to check settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , you always remember the colors for the pig@@ ment . also , there are many possibilities but do not take the easiest . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the preview not color on the Qu@@ ader and ball , just click on the button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the ground is now correct . if your image is ren@@ ders now with a click on the icon , you should get the following results : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the colo@@ uring you are expecting . here are further settings needed . in the color list , you have to insert two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this even more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board list can only be used with two colours ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree every@@ time , select in the object tree each time and change the colors in the view of the lens properties : &quot;
&quot; this step should you already be able to perform simply because you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you should have understood the sphere as simply as the ground : &quot;
in the view of the lens properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( don &apos;t forget the ball contact with the floor . otherwise the bul@@ let would float above the ground as you have moved the ground to move a unit down .
&quot; of course , the ren@@ ces now yields a strange result : as already before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . put in the following step a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; when you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material now . as already in the floor , enter the sphere as a pig@@ ment as color : &quot;
&quot; choose your first object and change the name for example in sphere pig@@ ment . click on the sphere of Pig@@ ment , select then one @-@ big and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; however , you can reach interesting effects when you take the time to set some finish characteristics : &quot;
change the values like in the following screen@@ caps and click to apply or push the input key .
&quot; the settings gl@@ oss effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if met@@ allic : not yet selected : &quot;
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; provides hope you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; when you pose a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ts , the rendering of hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the be@@ holder ( i.e. from the camera that effect the scenes ) through the objects and how to effect atmospheric effects such as fog . thus , the scene pixels is processed for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you see the scene . without a source of light , you also see nothing , the image is simple black . obviously , every scene needs to be extingu@@ ished , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have an extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaced the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . it is a new file , you must enter a name and storage space . &quot;
the scene has been restored in the last stored version . all changes since the last storage is rejected .
&quot; you can only select this menu entry , if you do not have any saved changes in the scene . &quot;
&quot; repeatedly re@@ vert the command . this menu entry , you can only select if you have used edit . &quot;
&quot; stores the current window order and opens a dialog , in which you enter a name for a new arrangement or write an existing order . &quot;
&quot; in this menu , you will find options for the setting of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cuts and the standard behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can edit or add new commands using this option .
opens a dialog to set up the tool @-@ tool . you can add and remove them using this option tool icons .
&quot; a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to make smo@@ other finishes , without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ ric form of the object itself . &quot;
it is common to use the same file both for a bite @-@ map as well as for a texture Map .
plots are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that you can use as components : very complex 3D models are made from dozens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models will then continue to give them a realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel base using a picture file as a color card .
&quot; &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable imaging and browser . the application has a file browser , where you can select images to display . &quot;
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the picture or in full @-@ screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ck@@ show ; is very easy . the file &apos;s browser lists files that you can display with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the button Return to return .
you can set whether each image is displayed in a separate window or whether all images are to be used to use the same window .
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , simply tap the first character of the file in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a suitable file name appears , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in a dialogue entitled - &amp; ku@@ ck@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , General and editing and slide show , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the two other , short commands for display window and short commands for the browser , you can set the keyboard short@@ cut for the respective window . &quot;
&quot; this is selected , then the images are displayed in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display surface can be filled with the background color that you can set further down . default is not a full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is enabled , invites &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still look at the current picture . this reduces the delay when you choose the next picture , and is particularly suitable for slide show . &quot;
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; at the end the name of the last opened folder . at the next start &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click the colored beams to select a background color . it is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the picture , then the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can set up &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , so set up that only some of the dat@@ atyp@@ es can be displayed . &quot;
this option is enlarged for big images to display the display window on the full screen . this option is switched as default .
sets whether the slideshow is to start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; the time @-@ change between image changes at a slide show . to change the value , you can input a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default setting is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of repeti@@ tions is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it will be abandoned by the user . to change the value , you can use a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows right next to the input field . default is 1 . &quot;
change the key@@ note for the different modes of operating &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the cardboard maps for display window and short commands for the browser .
&quot; with this option , turn off between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
shows large symbols for files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short display .
displays small symbols for files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short display .
displays advantages for files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short display .
reduces the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .

&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that do not do more than images and fl@@ atter .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; an easy application to scan images which can no longer do as pictures and save the pictures immediately in a given folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display the pictures before the store .
you can check the status of support of your scanner on the SAN@@ E project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set to the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal , if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is opened , then a dialog to select the scanner is opened . &quot;
the user can select the scanner scanner and press OK to open the scanner . ab@@ ort &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; finish .
the further settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( li@@ b@@ ks@@ ane ) covers these options not particularly .
&quot; to add a picture , the user can only start a preview and then start scanning for the final scan . the preview can be started through the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to select the picture better , the user can get into the image and zo@@ oming out of the current selection . it can also set the z@@ oom so that the complete preview of the window will fit . &quot;
if the image was selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
&quot; if before saving a preview display in the settings is displayed , then the image will be displayed in a showcase , as shown below , then the image is stored and Sch@@ lie ? en leads to a departure and you will enter into the main window . &quot;
&quot; by the button settings , the hom@@ onymous dialogue will be opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be chosen . &quot;
&quot; this option allows them to select the way &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images can pick up the dialog for each image , open the dialog before each and named picture . if &amp; sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; this automatically generated with an generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must save save without looking for a fil@@ en@@ ame folder . &quot;
&quot; this setting sets where the images stored in the option save without a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory , and you can edit this with the button . &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines a pre@@ fix for the automatically storage images and is beyond the proposed name for the picture in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved picture gets a numer@@ ical Su@@ ff@@ ix of each time , when a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adapt the image quality to save image quality . this value also changes the compression value while saving . if select the image quality not selected , then the standard value is used by Q@@ t . &quot;
the button aid starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ manual . the button On starts the K@@ DE @-@ dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; the button settings displays the dialog for settings and closing may be used to end &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; to end .

&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; used like all other programs short@@ cuts . below you can set up a list of this p@@ ump@@ kin and its function . the global short@@ cuts you can set up by clicking with the right mouse button to select the player window and select short commands .
you may set up existing multimedia buttons so that they function as &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; follow @-@ in instructions . by doing this make your keyboard to the &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; control centre .
&quot; the D@@ COP interface of Am@@ aro@@ k has many general functions , which mostly can be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists browser and scripts . an example call for the D@@ COP function break &amp; eg ; look like this : &quot;
Am@@ aro@@ k supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ ies ; in addition Am@@ aro@@ k has some own command line options .
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script can not be executed on account of a missing dependence . please check in your script if all required modules are present and make use of dialog , so that the user is not running . &quot;
B@@ EG@@ IN require &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE Bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
&quot; in the folder Scrip@@ ts / templates you will find a lot of submission scripts in many different languages . you can use it as the basis for your own scripts , or simply to extend it to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ COP can exchange your scripts with Am@@ aro@@ k and control Am@@ aro@@ k . the easiest way is using the command d@@ co@@ p ; , which should be attached to each K@@ DE installation . &quot;
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages allow you to execute external programs and commands . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; is usually called to be called ex@@ ec . here is an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; sends aler@@ ts to all the running scripts . for this reason , scrip@@ tions should constantly monitor their standard inser@@ tion and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script should ignore the events if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure We@@ is the script to display the dialog dialog . to store and store the furnishings data must take care of each script . if a script is started , Am@@ aro@@ k put the working folder to the folder , where all data should be saved . &quot;
tr@@ ack@@ ball sign@@ aled that a new piece will be played . the script should now &amp; eg ; with D@@ COP functions more information about the new piece will ask ( for example the met@@ adata or the piece @-@ length ) .
volum@@ et@@ change new@@ volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : subtle menu , disclosure the path to the selected files of the playlist when a user @-@ defined menu entry can be clicked on . to remove the menu d@@ co@@ p Am@@ aro@@ k script re@@ mo@@ ve@@ k script re@@ mo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( subtle menu ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; finished , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; the signal S@@ IG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , for example , storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ aro@@ ks script administration can also install script packages , which the user &amp; eg ; downloaded from a web@@ server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can op@@ tionally be identified with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) , so that the user can clearly see the archive as an am@@ aro@@ k script package . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 is only accepting script packages with the refinement amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should design@@ ate your script packages immediately . &quot;
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain file rights : &quot;
if your script package is ready you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and get the link to the Wi@@ ki script page of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; you should use the category Am@@ aro@@ k ; script .
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ ies ; it has many useful and powerful functions and is still surprisingly easy to use .

&quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; has , like most applications , some options you can enable or disable the comp@@ iling point with the configure script . this is a list of options available . &quot;
&quot; for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the section system requirements . &quot;
&quot; activated debu@@ gging icons . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you would like to help in the development of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; can be set up without effort on the furnishings . the furnishings dialog has several cardboard cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ;
&quot; players window display the player window in addition to the playlist , or out . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists window is displayed ( J@@ K ) . &quot;
voting bar@@ ometer use : this function is only available if &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option divi@@ des the experimental function of the voting bar@@ ometer .
&quot; voting Full : this function is only available , if &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this way , the color scheme for the voting bar@@ ometer is changed . &quot;
&quot; voting files in the music files : this feature is only available , if &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . otherwise the .@@ check files in the settings folder of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Am@@ aro@@ k / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is to be started when a browser is needed .
use other browser : here you can indicate the path to another browser which is not located in the list above .
&quot; to save the load , the current playlist will automatically save at the end of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; activate this option if you want to not lose the ongoing playlist at the operator . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files will be saved . &quot;
current piece of change can keep visible that the play@@ lists of the play@@ lists - / ab@@ rolls to keep the running piece always in the visible window area .
&quot; when changing the context of the context browser , it automatically displays the context @-@ browser when the next piece is played . &quot;
&quot; in the passage , you can adapt &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts sub@@ section . &quot;
&quot; in the fonts section , you can use the use of various fonts in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; otherwise you can select fonts for the following range : play@@ lists windows , players window and context browser . press text box , so you can select a type of font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of customised color scheme , you yourself have the tor@@ ment of choice and can set its own color scheme . use the color selection for front and background color . &quot;
&quot; re@@ viewing the start , continues that &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; after the program start playing the play@@ back automatically with the piece at the spot , with which it was stopped at the last charge . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window on screen display allows you to switch the OS@@ D . if on @-@ screen display is displayed , a preview of the OS@@ D is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
the first option is the font . click to select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OS@@ D . the check field shadow causes that the text in OS@@ D is sha@@ ded .
&quot; using our own colors gives you the option of adju@@ sting the OS@@ D colors for font and background . one click on the color choice opens the dialog to color selection . if sel@@ ector colors do not use , the pre @-@ presented &amp; k@@ ts ; -@@ colors are used . &quot;

&quot; the option screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . so , you can set the OS@@ D option on which screen should appear to the OS@@ D . &quot;
the cardboard card audio @-@ output lets you select an audio @-@ driver from the selection field . some drivers activate even further settings in this cardboard card .
the card collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , the &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check field next to his name . this section also contains approxim@@ ating fields to setup , as with the selected folders . &quot;
sub@@ folders reverse : this brings about that &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders to search .
&quot; monitoring changes : allows &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. if music files added or deleted ) , an incre@@ mental search will be carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
&quot; play@@ lists import : causes , that &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection are added later in the play@@ lists browser . &quot;
the part of a database database is used to choose a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected still further facilities in the sub @-@ window My@@ S@@ ql setup is needed .
&quot; the My@@ S@@ ql @-@ setup section is used to set the database for &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; under calcul@@ ator , the machine will enter into which the My@@ S@@ ql @-@ database is available . after that , the database port is entered , under which the database is achiev@@ able . name : is the database name , which the database is established . &quot;
use user name : and password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
&quot; the card controllers last@@ .@@ f@@ m is the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server , and if necessary to create music recommendations concerning the current piece . &quot;
&quot; click here for your user@@ name and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send pieces and update such a profile : this option allows it &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; to send the names of played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
&quot; similar interpre@@ ters will call : after activation of this attitude , &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters to the each played piece . note : you can &apos;t need the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to be able to use this function . &quot;
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; eg ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen photos .
&quot; Am@@ aro@@ k needs only the package of K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to be installed K@@ deli@@ bs , because &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; needed some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide just how to compile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal . &quot;
&quot; some features such as OS@@ D pres@@ upp@@ oses that your window manager will prepare the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ cop@@ top@@ .org . then , flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to assist Am@@ aro@@ k on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these are an excellent development environment . &quot;
&quot; most likely , one of your files will make an error in the equ@@ li@@ b library . you can locate the file by clicking in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Am@@ aro@@ k / share / apps / Am@@ aro@@ k / share / apps / Am@@ aro@@ k / share / apps / Am@@ aro@@ k / share / apps / Am@@ aro@@ k / collection _ scan@@ .@@ log . after that , you can delete the file and let the collection again . &quot;
&quot; mostly , it is that Tag@@ lib when reading the met@@ a @-@ info from that file cras@@ hes . please report this error to the Tag@@ us developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
if you use MySQL as a database then you can try SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is something more mature .
&quot; make sure all of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; used libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x compiled , this leads to rush to the editing of the met@@ a information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then disable it automatically when in@@ active for ... in the setting of the sound system , or do not use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically with a crash ) . when it comes to a common back@@ trace , the error will be solved . &quot;
&quot; this is because many program write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 in met@@ a @-@ info , but they do not identify as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; &quot; The $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b@@ - &gt; new ( $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; Set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) see in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 always actively . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes you can click on the control center under appearance icons . note that in some cases , you must click on a symbol until this setting displays their effect . &quot;
if you receive this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ read icon : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Rest@@ m@@ ap@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pixel . this can be used with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t follow .
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Am@@ aro@@ k will find the right version first . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most installation problems clarify the easiest by using an expert your Uni@@ xes or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or for developers . use the forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Am@@ aro@@ k .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter there only a mistake if you are interested in solving an error in Am@@ aro@@ k himself .
after the start of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; only a blank playlist will appear . how to get there music pieces ?
&quot; this is easy . use the file browser on the left side , and open the folder . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist . &quot;
&quot; to keep the surface intuitive , the start -@@ window into the Statisti@@ cs window is converted . you will find it under ex@@ tras . &quot;
the significance of these symbols has changed with Am@@ aro@@ k 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the review by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate pieces must be shown in the playlist the rating column . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column review . this also works when Am@@ aro@@ k is located in the background .
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press up on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select from playlist out of the fold menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a play@@ lists file with your mouse into the playlist and let it fall there , just how to make it with other files too . that &apos;s how it is : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , next to the Add @-@ button , you can save the button playlist . click on it . &quot;
presumably the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel is missing . install the package x@@ m@@ ms de@@ vel and install &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; new . also look to li@@ b@@ ye to this package contains lots of very nice visu@@ alizations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . besides , you will find it via the menu bar under ex@@ tras E@@ quali@@ zer .... &quot;
&quot; no . yes , this really is true ! not ! ! not an independent approach , therefore the actual question must be Which media types supports g@@ ate@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / M@@ AS / N@@ MM / M@@ AS / N@@ MM / M@@ AS / N@@ MM / M@@ AS / N@@ MM / M@@ AS / N@@ MM / M@@ AS / N@@ MM / M@@ AS / N@@ MM / M@@ AS / N@@ MM / M@@ AS / N@@ MM / M@@ AS / N@@ MM / M@@ AS / N@@ MM / M@@ AS / N@@ MM / M@@ AS / N@@ MM / M@@ AS / N@@ DE@@ mm . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even support text and P@@ NG ! &quot;
&quot; it can ! maybe use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in default no MP3 deco@@ ders are provided ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : old @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input taste &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ NO@@ TE driver with the Al@@ sa S@@ ink the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time and can be achieved with audio mix@@ er ( e.g. SB@@ live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa .
&quot; the output of this command should help you in search of the problem @-@ problems and a solution . for g@@ amer , you may need to specify a different S@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ way ) . &quot;
&quot; this is doing &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; already . do not forget that media should be de@@ co@@ ded at al@@ sa , you would just choose a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ code it and sends the PC@@ M data to Al@@ sa . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ co@@ ded the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can print directly to Al@@ sa , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open the control centre Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable you to set the size of the Sound Pu@@ ffer ( warning output ) and increase the size of the Sound Pu@@ ffer ( warning , see the next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper SU@@ ID is set : &quot;
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia co@@ dec@@ s who can cause the disturbed play@@ back . read this error report . the magni@@ fier of the Sound Pu@@ ff@@ ers in your Al@@ sa furnishings file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
&quot; either you do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia completely to obtain the faster Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ m@@ pe@@ gli@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; probably you use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts bu@@ ffer in control center and sound &amp; Multimedia , sound system . the smaller the bu@@ ffer , the less income respond to visu@@ alis@@ ations . yes , this is an error , please help us fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ stre@@ amer driver , cras@@ hes and Am@@ aro@@ k ; off . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you have to register all the components . follow G@@ ST register to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this does not help , you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer . &quot;
try this ( finish Am@@ aro@@ k beforehand ! ) : - Download S@@ SU@@ P@@ peg to compile and install it . then run the module folder of G@@ ST config and once as your normal user . then delete G@@ ST file with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ rie@@ amer config ) and run G@@ ST @-@ register again . now start &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k .
please report on bu@@ ci@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes to send it to our mailing list : Am@@ aro@@ k @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is an album of the British Mike Classic field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . furthermore the name contains the magic K ... : )
&quot; thanks to D@@ COP is this already possible . place an alarm in your calendar program , and let you run with the alarm of this command : d@@ co@@ p Am@@ aro@@ k player play &quot;
&quot; this command leaves &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; to start playing . make sure that &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; runs before you go to bed , then you are awakened by the gentle tones of the music that you stopped before going to bed . &quot;
how to get the current in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; current titles can be found if you are on another computer ?
if a functional SSH environment is present you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpre@@ ter and title of the current piece : ssh -@@ i ~ / .@@ ssh / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ user name Am@@ aro@@ k player now Play@@ ing
replace IP address with your IP and your user@@ name with your user@@ name . this requires that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA file .
the visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; window can be separated . push for this on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer open in an independent , in the size changing window . &quot;
the combination of Str@@ g + Right click represents a piece in the chin @-@ up order into the queue . by pressing the input key after a search in the playlist the first search results will be played and the search returned .
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ ck@@ rich functions , but how does it look with the symbol in the system stage section of the Control bar ? &quot;
clicking with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; click on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browsers will be displayed .
&quot; my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on an NFS drive . after the start of Am@@ aro@@ k , the collection database cannot be created and the console appear many error messages . what now ? &quot;
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; does not work with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Am@@ aro@@ k on a local drive or use am@@ aro@@ K@@ s MySQL support .
&quot; insert the CD , then click on the Audio CD menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . you can switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a con@@ quer@@ or window . automatic enco@@ ding instead take files from folders mp3 or og@@ g . &quot;

&quot; basically , this fits the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece has been played , the less influence has every single rating on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can insert the rating for a piece by yourself by clicking with the right mouse button on a column image in the play@@ lists window . there you can select the evaluation of a piece just as any other attributes , namely by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece and edit : rating , or edit F@@ 2 . you can also edit the review in the dialog Met@@ adata . &quot;
the developers do not want to show you when you have to publish a stable version of Am@@ aro@@ k . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan which does not bring together with the short @-@ term plan of Am@@ aro@@ k .
&quot; this is a new feature in Am@@ aro@@ k , which some users can easily find annoying . disable the option symbol when playing them in general settings . &quot;
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool to set up ... and take the desired changes there .
&quot; download a design or create your own . install this then under Am@@ aro@@ k ... appearance context @-@ browser design , click on new design .... &quot;
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphi@@ cs Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) similar to avoiding difficulties it was removed .

audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is a free service sent to the information on which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and password . audio cro@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ;
&quot; if you want to use Al@@ sa , then please the latest available version . old Al@@ sa versions have a lot of cras@@ hes and thus also caused a lot of error reports . &quot;
presumably &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled before you have x@@ ine or g@@ at@@ eness installed . therefore the . / configure routine does not compile this output modules . you have to configure &amp; configure .
well I &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; new installed but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
&quot; probably you use a distribution , which is installed by the development files separated from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary development files are missing . after that , you have to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you have to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine . &quot;
I get the error G@@ stre@@ amer Cri@@ tical * * : Factory for &apos;@@ ad@@ der &apos;@@ has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ ays which is in@@ compati@@ bly with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you have to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inqu@@ ishing . a tip of Merlin @-@ TC : use@@ d@@ ne you do not compile L@@ D@@ FL@@ AG@@ S when you compile Am@@ aro@@ k .
&quot; I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed . &quot;
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ stre@@ amer , you must also have to install the module g@@ stre@@ amer quick@@ time . &quot;
you get the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play an MP3 stream , but the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as a system managed G@@ ST register . then start Am@@ aro@@ k . &quot;
I have a second sound card and use al@@ sa . how can Am@@ aro@@ k use the second sound card ?
under settings Am@@ aro@@ k set up ... audio output type the device . typical is Z. B. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound@@ card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 @-@ co@@ dec and a USB audio device :

&quot; enter the dialog dialog by x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib , takes care of the conversion of ta@@ str@@ ates , channels and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual mix device , disable the tick on sound card . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio issue with Arts is not further taken care of . you may naturally like to take this problem yourself ! if you want , you can choose the new so much needed tut@@ ors for Arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the furniture assistant that would like to update at the first start of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; if you want to update your collection or simply don &apos;t like it , then you &apos;ll have to set up your collection instructions . with their help you will be set up &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; in a few minutes . &quot;

&quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; install the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . additionally , some additional packages are listed below , which make working with &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; more pleasant . &quot;
&quot; if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. R@@ PM or apt ) , you must also install the development version of these packages ! &quot;
&quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . additionally , &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; however , a playlist that is superior to all other features . the play@@ lists window contains several browsers with which you can capture and search your entire music collection . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , explains how all the functions of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; used , including the creation of a collection and a playlist . &quot;
&quot; the player window is your A @-@ click &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; control center . at the top of the window is a run @-@ text display , which indicates the current current piece or current current stream . one click on this area changes the display of the already exp@@ ired Play@@ time to the remaining time of the piece . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the player window contains a selection of audio analytics , also under the run @-@ text display . you can change through the available analy@@ zer by clicking on the area right click on the area . &quot;
the &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . squee@@ ze d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , enlarged window . &quot;
&quot; under the run @-@ texts , there are also the buttons PL and E@@ Q . the button PL is activated or de@@ activated the play@@ lists window , while the button E@@ Q is used to setup equ@@ ali@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of the play@@ back buttons , the volume control and the piece @-@ position @-@ sli@@ der . use the sli@@ ders to adjust the piece @-@ position or the volume . with play@@ back buttons , you can start playing / stop and switch to the next or previous piece . &quot;
&quot; the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pre@@ settings , from Klassik to Techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own preferences . &quot;
to view the E@@ quali@@ zer you will use Ex@@ tras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click on the button E@@ Q in the player window . once you activate the check field E@@ quali@@ zer the E@@ quali@@ zer is in operation .
the playlist of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ ts ; available multimedia player . it has many features that there is no other player . but let &apos;s not get off from the abundance of functions they are all easy to use .
&quot; the play@@ lists window can be split into two main areas , on the left side of the navigation area . in the navigation area you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . on the right , you can use the playlist itself . the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users are powerful enough . &quot;
&quot; the context browser displays different information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be customized with the help of context @-@ browser design . the context @-@ browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and performer . these three sub@@ windows will later be made into detail later . &quot;
if you already have earlier versions of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; perhaps you might be noticed that the sub@@ window will start off . the information presented there are now collected in other parts of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; moreover the information in the Statisti@@ cal window can be collected ( ex@@ tras statistics ) .
&quot; sub@@ window music displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the interpre@@ ter and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first section in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , performer and the album . below you see the cover image of the album and next to a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to trace the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ un@@ z database . &quot;
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you can find more information about the current piece . you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its rating .
&quot; to view cover pictures in the context browser , the cover images are shown in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats can have any name but pictures with the word front are preferred . the context @-@ browser will also display cover pictures that are either downloaded with the Cover Administration or are embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next area , Re@@ commen@@ ded pieces , lists several suggested pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will immediately be played . &quot;
&quot; among the recommended pieces , there are the favour@@ ites of this interpre@@ ter . this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpre@@ ter . &quot;
you can set which information in the music window will be displayed . click with the right mouse button somewhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
&quot; the last area , albums of the interpre@@ ter , lists all albums of the current interpre@@ ter that you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will open up and you will see the content of the album . &quot;
you can click on all pieces in the individual areas to start immediately with the play@@ back . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select from the context menu one of the options for adding the piece or album to playlist .
&quot; in the sub@@ window text the downloaded lyrics for the running piece is shown . note that this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download the text for writing scripts . if you click on the text window , you can download the text for the piece from the Internet . if there is no text script , you can choose which should be started . &quot;
&quot; the button button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then saved in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; s collection database . in addition , no running text script is necessary . &quot;
the button search opens a search to gle@@ .com according to the lyrics for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group@@ ing interpre@@ t - grouped only the top level , each piece is shown directly below the interpre@@ ter . albums or genres are being ignored . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing interpre@@ ter / album - first of all , the pieces are sorted according to interpre@@ ter . if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums , this is the best view on your collection - these albums are displayed on the list under different interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; group interpre@@ ter / year - album - Sor@@ ted by interpre@@ t , and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year for one album is unknown , the default 0 - Alb@@ um@@ name is related . &quot;
group@@ ing album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically with each other . the interpre@@ ter is ignored .
group@@ ing genre / performer - your pieces will first be sorted according to the genre and including interpre@@ ter .
&quot; group@@ ing genre / performer - This setting works as well as the above , but also sorted according to the album below the performer . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust and combine the group@@ ing entirely upon expos@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; with the last button , you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; will automatically collect your collection as soon as you own some of the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this might take a while . &quot;
&quot; directly under the tool@@ bar , there is a search filter . it is the same in the list view as well as in Baumeister &apos;s view . information about using this fil@@ ters can be found in the section to playlist in this manual . &quot;
&quot; below the search filter is a selection field , with which help you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection , starting from the last 24 hours up to a year . besides , you can also select your overall collection , whereby the filter is practically switched off . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the right mouse button , on an entry in the collection browser you will receive the following options . &quot;
download - This is the current playlist and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order in the play@@ back .
&quot; on playlist , you attach the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on one entry you reach the same effect . &quot;
cut pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces into queue . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - saves the selected pieces as a playlist . you are asked for a name under which the list should be saved .
&quot; on media player , add the pieces to queue for transfer to the media player . further details can be found in the section on the Media Player browser . &quot;
&quot; all pieces of this performer burn / On CD - Due to you , the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a file or as audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not appear . &quot;
met@@ adata ( for n pieces ) to process ... - opens the dialog for piece @-@ information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( s ) move files in the tr@@ ash@@ can ... - opens a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; as a compilation , marking the selected album as a compilation , promp@@ ting it under different interpre@@ ters . &quot;
compilation marking - changes one as a compilation marked album back into a normal album . the album is then no longer shown under different interpre@@ ters but again under the interpre@@ ter interpre@@ ter .
the play@@ lists browser designed to deal with many play@@ lists . among other things he also contains Intel@@ ligent Play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser contains the intelligent play@@ lists . these use &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for running time . the intelligent play@@ lists are composed of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
&quot; even even created , Intel@@ lec@@ tual Play@@ lists are possible . click the Intel@@ ligent playlist to open the dialog to create a new Intel@@ ligent playlist . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
the sub @-@ window media player is used for the connection of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; to be used for example your iPod with &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod will be integrated . if &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; in the upper list of the Media Player browser .
&quot; to transfer pieces on your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list of performer . if you are finished , the pieces are finished on your iPod . if the transmission is finished , exit &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; and solve the run@@ time band@@ aging for your iPod . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is particularly useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden , which do not correspond to your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the file @-@ browser is a address bar , with which you press music from an entered URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ di / musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z enter and drop the music from there into the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window space , the app@@ endi@@ ces of files can be difficult . in the case , the holding of the Shift key may be helpful : this will be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not at the Mau@@ position . &quot;
&quot; the playlist is tor@@ tured all of you to play@@ able pieces . you can change the order by simply drag the entries to the desired place . once you enter letters , you &apos;ll just add the pieces to reset the filter so long as the text box is empty until the text box is empty . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a separate searches , is &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; search for entries that contain all searches . if you enter two three entries , the search will find all entries , one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; if you enter between the searches for searches , which contain either one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that one or two or three are included ( or a combination of it ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries , the space characters contain , then join the search term with ge@@ views : Mike Classic field . this will be searched for entries , but not for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a specific search engine , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : &gt; 50@@ th . this searches for pieces that have a higher rating as 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , make a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ a search for pieces that do not contain anything . &quot;
&quot; you can combine this syn@@ ths variations for exposure together . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this searches for all pieces that contain either Mike Classic field , or have a higher rating as 50 and do not contain the comment . &quot;
&quot; you can set the play@@ back sequence of entries by clicking the strings button down , and then click with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries . the entries will then receive a marking with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are displayed . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left you will find the button Add to add to the playlist . right , you can find playlist , playlist , empty and accidental . &quot;
&quot; next follow the buttons , and restore it . this allows you to re@@ vert or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the tool@@ bar , there is a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the refres@@ her can click on the Analy@@ zer with a click of the right mouse button . &quot;
the last button in tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that you can see in the player window on the right mouse button . via this menu you can set up &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; s configuration set up .
&quot; there are still many more available buttons for tool@@ bar , for example re@@ viewing checks and loud@@ speaker . you can set up the buttons by clicking on the menu and set up there tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of useful information about the playlist . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the playing time of the current piece . moreover , the status for random mode and re @-@ fetch can be easily changed by clicking with the mouse twice in the appropriate display area . &quot;
&quot; you can also select the status bar , disable the status bar , in general settings . &quot;
&quot; the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking in the playlist on the menu . through this menu you can reach the settings of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k . &quot;
one click on this entry opens the window visu@@ alization plug @-@ ins . there you can select the visu@@ alis@@ ations of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ;
behind this entry a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ;
the Cover Administration is a useful tool to manage your cover pictures . you can start by selecting action cover administration in the collection browser .
the Cover Administration contains a list of list of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an interpre@@ ter in your collection by selecting the interpre@@ ter .
&quot; with the menu View , you can choose what to display in the cover administration . select from : &quot;
&quot; the queue administration received your big de@@ duction in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control over the playlist . after you put a piece into the queue , the pieces appears in the playlist . this number represents the order , in the &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; the pieces will be played , 2 as a second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; the maintenance of the queue will open you via ex@@ tras queue . if you want to add a piece in the playlist , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also use the pieces using the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . the order of the pieces can then change in the queue administration . &quot;
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists of which two are already given ( the details about the furnishings of this follow later ) .
fills your playlist with random pieces from your whole collection and add further random pieces while playing more random pieces .
adds pieces based on last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio cro@@ b@@ bler ) . this mode requires that already some pieces in your playlist are located . you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile so that this dynamic playlist will work .
&quot; click to the desired playlist , drag them to the playlist window or click with the right mouse button on you and then select it . this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist . so you should save the old playlist under circumstances ! &quot;
&quot; the two pre @-@ presented modes of random mix and play@@ lists mix immediately fill up your playlist and you can add the play@@ back directly . the playlist commen@@ ded pieces starts with an empty playlist and you must add at least one piece by yourself from your collection , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , then enable the last possible dynamic mode : settings dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . using the same menu entry , the dynamic mode can be de@@ activated once again . &quot;
&quot; the button Re@@ fill the current playlist and add new pieces in accordance with the dynamic mode . playlist will open the dialog to editing the playlist , and you can change the appropriate settings . &quot;
&quot; with a right click on a dynamic playlist you have the option to click on Edit . then , the dialog for editing the settings of the playlist will open . &quot;
&quot; enter any name for the playlist , however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this attitude is not active , your playlist will grow continuously , the settings for coming pieces will be over and they will not listen to this playlist any piece twice . if the setting is active , the pieces are already played under consideration the setting of gest@@ ed pieces . &quot;
&quot; played pieces - this is the number of played pieces , which are to be kept at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces were recently played . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces to be added after each played piece to the playlist . if you set here more than 1 , the playlist will continuously grow , because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right side were already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross multiple play@@ lists , random pieces from each of the collected play@@ lists will add . &quot;
some scripts make their own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then click on .
&quot; you can install new &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; scripts that you can install on the script , in which a script package will be installed on the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . use the button for more scripts . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to use a script for longer , you can delete it . select this to delete script then click D@@ un@@ installing . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information about writing your scripts , please check the writing of scripts . &quot;
&quot; the dialog window visu@@ alization plug @-@ ins will be used for activ@@ ating the available visu@@ alis@@ ations in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; the window contains a list of all available plugins . to use a plugin , simply enable the check field next to the name . &quot;
&quot; this Quick guide will show you how to create an audio CD in four steps ; to trace the steps , you must have a loud installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and a folder with audio files . &quot;
this is a dialog window in which you can select which files you want to burn on CD .
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD from MP3 &apos;s or other los@@ sy formats , then remember that you will receive a worse quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is created . you can check if an audio CD is created by a los@@ sy format . use the project au@@ CD@@ ect . &quot;

c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program to read digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital audio ) . on the Internet such programmes are generally called ri@@ pper .
&quot; O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patented and professional technology for audio data stream . O@@ GG pre @-@ profits from Open Source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis De@@ oder@@ - and En@@ coder modules . &quot;
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ audio de@@ pot . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Lay@@ er I , Lay@@ er II , and Lay@@ er III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 deco@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ame : a far developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . L@@ ame is used by the MP3 @-@ En@@ coder module . &quot;
FL@@ AC : a free open source code for loss @-@ free audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by FL@@ AC decoder and the external audio en@@ coder module so you can read and write FL@@ AC files .
&quot; Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FL@@ AC , Muse@@ pack Dec@@ oder : further libraries for processing different audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg it is possible for example possible to de@@ code WMA files to burn it on an audio CD . &quot;
&quot; so@@ x : a relief program , which can be used between different audio formats and can convert . so@@ x is used by the so@@ x Audio En@@ coder module . &quot;
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ CD@@ Ima@@ ger : one in the functionality full of the author system to edit , dis@@ assemb@@ ling and analy@@ sing video CDs and super @-@ video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool will be use@@ able to adjust the volume of music files to a standard stage . this can be useful for example , for creating woven CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections , for example , norm@@ alize the different absorption of different albums to the un@@ nice effect that the music pieces can be reproduced differently . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start recording CD and automatically re@@ play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
&quot; this is a convenient way , recently opened projects again to load again . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project . &quot;
&quot; if the project was saved already once the project was over@@ written , otherwise it will be over@@ written prior to a new fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; stores the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialogue Save is displayed , with which you can choose the folder and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file . &quot;
stores all opened projects . that &apos;s the same as if you were able to call for each individual project file .
&quot; closing the current project . if a project has changed and not yet saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after , what will happen . you can then drop between save and modifications . also , you can also break off and keep the project so open . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each un@@ saved project , what happened to happen , just as if you had been sent for each project file . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects and finished &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for each non @-@ stored project will be asked what should happen , as if you had inv@@ oked file . &quot;
&quot; when you call this entry , you can select over the appearing dialog files to add to the project . this has the same effect as if you enter the files directly from the top view to the project view , the files added to the basic folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog &quot; &quot; Burn &quot; &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; to burning the medium . the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make a lot of project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above the What is that ? -@@ Help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
&quot; this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it &apos;s useful when you can import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful for you , even if this function is not used , so you can see the files and folders available on the medium . &quot;
&quot; this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function prompted by &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . this function removes no files from the medium , it bl@@ ends only the previously imported files again . &quot;
&quot; opens the CD @-@ head dialog . this also allows the copy of a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also only create a copy of a CD which you might want to burn later . besides , there is also the possibility of going on instead of normal cop@@ ier . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; opens the DVD copy dialog . this also allows the copy of a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also only create a copy of a DVD with the help of copying dialogue . besides , there is also the possibility of taking a DVD with the help of copying dialogue . moreover , the target medium must be large enough to accommodate the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog for the form@@ atting of a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing mod@@ i and incre@@ mentally . &quot;
&quot; burns a previous CD @-@ subscription . the dialogue asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which then immediately will not be supported by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , therefore you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burns an earlier DVD @-@ image . the dialogue asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; a previous DVD video can be converted . thereby , this dialog window will usually be used after reading a DVD in the index , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the illuminated video , enco@@ ding settings and even ways of changing the size and cut black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the occasional medium . this information is displayed in the table view , and include properties of the medium , such as size and title length of CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; displays a list of tool@@ making of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; when this is crossed , a small box at the bottom of the window is displayed . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is blan@@ ked . &quot;
&quot; the folder view points out or out . the folder view includes an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled , the content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locking and block the disk or throwing the medium . &quot;
spl@@ its the view points or out . the view points allows you to select and drag files into the proj@@ ector . the ingredients is also the interface to read audi@@ o- or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the Cop@@ y list is a narro@@ wer in the projection screen , or out of . the Cop@@ y list is a narro@@ wer area , which is only visible when the projection screen has no real function , it looks very pretty and separates the projection view clearly from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog window to change the keyboard orders for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after having selected one of the available commands in the upper part , one can adjust the button order below . &quot;
&quot; this will start the K@@ 3@@ b ; furnishings assistant . thus , the proper per@@ missions to burning CDs and DVDs are required . therefore , system administration rights are required so you must enter the password for system administration ( root ) . &quot;
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here general programs can be made . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on call@@ ings . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and to the enemy of the program .
&quot; &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface provided . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled by a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions to use , you can either use the command @-@ line program d@@ co@@ p , or the slightly more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are in functionality and the type of your task is decisive , however , which the accompanying program you can give . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter we assume that you can use the command @-@ line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , you must make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following to the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; programs have in common , supported &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two further parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the Standard D@@ COP interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; features functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other features for generating new projects . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ les@@ hooting for &amp; k@@ ies ; with it can easily be read and stored in MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on the en@@ coder of the machine installed on the machine . &quot;
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading of &amp; CD ; data contained in W@@ AV files on hard disk ) and from many enco@@ ding packages ( this codi@@ le packages still need to be added from Linux distribution ) . further enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
&quot; first , the titles of the &amp; CD will be read and stored in W@@ AV files on your computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then &quot;
&quot; in a second step , these W@@ AV files ( usually one per title ) compressed to the MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG format or in other formats such as loss @-@ free FL@@ AC . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost any distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this has to be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ pres@@ up@@ to ( for O@@ GG ) or other codes are already available , so it is most likely not necessary to compile something yourself . however , if FL@@ AC is not used , its installation is also not required . &quot;
&quot; which enco@@ ding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to codi@@ le , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word about copying audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not provided to handle any copy protection CD ; even if not the mechanisms of copying tools . avoid simply buying copies of copied audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while applying dialog only one has to be done ( the furnishings dialog can be called up to a suitable configuration ) , after reading a &amp; CD which results in the hard disk . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you often stum@@ ble across the beginning . &quot;
&quot; convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ dings are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FL@@ AC &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB can get from the Internet or work completely without a network , whereby everything is manually captured . &quot;
&quot; this is only a brief list of the commands of the main window . on the side step by step , you will find more information about how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; starting the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data , corresponding to the establishment of inquiry in the tab tab CD@@ DB . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . ) &quot;
starts the reading and - if an en@@ coder in the tab tab has been configured - the code settings .
&quot; opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available en@@ coder , so that the selection with another en@@ coder can be read as the default . it is noted that previously the en@@ coder in the tab tab has been configured in the dialog tab . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already un@@ loaded file will be selected for enco@@ ding rather than a full &amp; CD ; read and code . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog dialog for the kind of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( how to read the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main approach dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different cart@@ els ( such as en@@ coder , to setup the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here , you must go before the program can successfully be used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ding and compression rati@@ os and helps you choose the right Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is needed . besides FL@@ AC there are also others like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may possibly be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly any available commercial devices that can be found . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats , the information provided by data compressed according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG may have the most common advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate , the differences will be less important as both co@@ effici@@ encies produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; o &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will still be supplied with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions &quot;
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) but compared to O@@ GG easily deeper quality at deeper bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from one computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG devices are present .
&quot; MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car @-@ stereo systems . today - initially , these devices support only the MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and consequ@@ ent compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting yields good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should typically offer transparency for most people and most of the music pieces acceptable transparency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps CB@@ R , compression rate about 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R common stereo , compression rate approximately 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good pleasures for music of young people , portable devices and car @-@ stere@@ os@@ ystem . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps CB@@ R . this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments , but if you want to have absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information which are manually entered into the program from the free@@ DB program , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can transfer / needed to create folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with codi@@ fication programmes , there is often a combination of programs for the enco@@ ders and these parameters here . the manual or the aid to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; e.g. to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : day ) , if MP@@ 3@@ s are co@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switches should be added from &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks as follows : &apos; ... -@@ tt &#93; title } ... &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button @-@ drawing in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which persons can download the audio CD , so that all others may download the information instead of yourself in the hosts : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I am not meant to be attorney . however , nobody can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be added . all information can be obtained from any bum@@ ble@@ bee by a &amp; CD ; business , physically or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is actively choosing a cross field ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it appears , the e @-@ mail address when retri@@ eving the data from the server cannot be used ( This can only know the programmer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; used for the use of free@@ DB , the geo@@ graphi@@ cally will be used on the next mirror server . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org delivers a current list of mir@@ rors for online retri@@ eval &amp; CD ; information during the reading of a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) just the updates of the database .
which selection program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in W@@ AV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that it is used to be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ; who want to know more precisely in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see to be considered that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package has to be installed first if this has not yet been done .
&quot; to save the loaded W@@ AV files , the enco@@ ders and thus the desired file format can be chosen . at the first opening there are pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FL@@ AC ( a loss @-@ free compression for audio data ) on the tab for placing the code . other codes can be added on this tab . &quot;
&quot; the Ko@@ di@@ zer package must be installed by the relevant Linux distribution , before the enco@@ ders can be used . further information about Ko@@ di@@ ers are in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; after installing a code , you can get more information about his switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a sol@@ itary window ( eg ; console ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the set of equipment drawing of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the spelling and readers of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) installed . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give an indication of what is wrong . &quot;
check whether you do not want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the envelope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with one step by step . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have read the full manual , everything understood but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step by step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
in this example we will start the program for the first time and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; use MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 key@@ word ( tags ) .
&quot; it must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your machine . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine , since it is not necessary to compile the source files , what you can do of course . &quot;
&quot; please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists , and that you write them out ( eg . by trying to copy something into the con@@ quer@@ or something into it ) . &quot;
&quot; the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something which is supposed to be done only once and &quot;
the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each time .
&quot; here we determine the use of enco@@ ding to the compression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) and the audio format ( MP3 ) and which structure is used . as we are lazy , we share the program using the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it with any reading of a &amp; CD , if once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the equipment drawing is passed to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
&quot; / dev / CD@@ ROM is a symbolic link to the real device name of your run . if this does not work or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , a view to the file / etc / f@@ stab can also be accessed with the available entries for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the cart@@ on Card General settings . here &apos;s not much to do here . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is being loaded / entered as shown in the scre@@ enshot . &quot;
&quot; only in case of un@@ full information you may ask , so you will be notified when details are missing for the exemp@@ tion of keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
the card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and allow the &amp; CD to automatically download the Internet from a free@@ DB machine .
note : the machine must be connected to the Internet during the reading of the &amp; CD ; to connect to the free@@ DB server .
&quot; the second selection field is easier , becomes a &amp; CD ; entry found immediately begins to read the &amp; CD entry . this is dis@@ satisfied with the file entry and the fil@@ en@@ ame / fil@@ en@@ ame or tag entries , they can be easily changed - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ ies ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , further to note : if you want to enter everything manually , you disable the selection fields and free@@ DB is not used . however , it is worth using free@@ DB locally on the offline mode , the two choices must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following cardboard card . &quot;
CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the information requested by calling the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server on the Internet . how does the system know which data the CD should get ? read the section on free@@ DB . use everything as shown in the scre@@ enshot .
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to the site fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look at it after a mirror server near the machines . however , this option will work as a first try . &quot;
&quot; both function equivalent to the server , since many fire@@ walls contain the protocol 88@@ 80 standards , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually is open to surf the internet . &quot;
in this example we do not want to send a &amp; CD to the free@@ DB server . the first check field should be de@@ activated .
just take the settings from the scre@@ enshot . ( imagine that the folder / tmp is available on your computer )
&quot; number of simultaneously extrac@@ ting pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive ? parallel reading and code ? the author doesn &apos;t know , therefore simply try yourself . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , please cross this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you are going to check this . this can be useful if only space on another drive exists . if the field is not enabled , the files will not be displayed in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something using the W@@ AV files . &quot;
&quot; all as input as it is at the screen photo . the command is a bit long , under circumstances does something to turn right down to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo . the resulting compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; to limit the generation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1.@@ &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if needed . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; ID@@ 3 &apos; day for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the scre@@ enshot . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; number of simultaneously to co@@ ding W@@ AV files : with a dual @-@ core or quad@@ core , or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to codi@@ fy more than one W@@ AV file simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; used . if you &apos;ve chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; in this section is described , as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; the folder structure , the type as described as the music on the hard disk . first , a connection to the internet is structured , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB is described , must be repeated for any out@@ going &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; as we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet included in free@@ DB , you will see the screen@@ caps a little different from the data stored for a &amp; CD ; therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually enter , instead of releasing them from the Internet . comments are given to the differences . &quot;
don &apos;t try the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this has not yet been done , now the &amp; CD has to be done ; in the drive that was defined in the main window . &quot;
after a short moment the pieces and its length should be listed in the window as in the scre@@ enshot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
&quot; if this does not happen , then you are looking for questions and answers about the help or go back to the previous section on basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successful by the free@@ DB could be picked up by the free@@ DB , all the titles of the songs have already been filled , and the name of the artist and the album are displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; gives you a window appears , and you can select the database entry that best suits your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have the check box for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have local database , but you need the access to the internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD @-@ editor - entering the CD @-@ Data and the title of the first piece
type the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first row of the input field &apos; update &apos; update &apos; to the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
&quot; the artist must no longer be entered into the &quot; &quot; Lat@@ est title &quot; &quot; input field , unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ en@@ ell per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after successful termination of the data from the free@@ DB , the CD editor is not empty , but it contains always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor ( e.g. if all words with upper@@ case letters begin or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece , and only 28 characters for the commentary box . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , at least to what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed . this option is set up on the tab tab for code settings ; take a look at the &apos; basic settings &apos; section . &quot;
&quot; you can change the day information of the generated files later with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all Ko@@ di@@ ers or file formats . see the Help for Ko@@ di@@ erer in order to get more information .
just choose an entry that obviously does not agree with the style of the out@@ source CD ; in this example this is not important because we don &apos;t transmit the &amp; CD ; data anyway is not possible . for more information go to the categories of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example are found under rock .
&quot; after selecting &apos; OK &apos; come back to the main window , simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
the window of the CD editor will appear again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the available data that we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the piece of the current piece . the title of the piece is definitely and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and procedure in the same way up to you all the title data of the &amp; CD ; entered .
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are shown above the piece list .
&quot; note that it has a check characters in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are selected , or make sure that all pieces are selected , or pressing the button all pieces selected at the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces at one time . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the button selected , this window appears for confirmation . click OK , and then we will have a look at the window with the orders and follow what &apos;s going off . &quot;
&quot; click on the rider &apos;s orders to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is read straight on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left part of the window in the status bar . &quot;
this error message can be seen if you are trying to work with a code that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully co@@ ded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the tmp @-@ file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example . did you check if you have spelling to the folder for temporary files and the target folder ? ; - ) &quot;
&quot; now it is clear , why the mistake occurred right after the end of reading the first piece . &quot;
&quot; assignment 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the code of piece 1 into the format MP3 . therefore , read and co@@ ding parallel . notice the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has not found configuration attitude to sup@@ press this behavior . the only thing that is configur@@ able , the result is unclear . the machine used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and code ( of however two different pieces ) . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is co@@ ded , and a third order is co@@ ded in the queue of the code . after the last piece is co@@ ded , a small window will appear with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . / 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the code of your choice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is today talking to CVS . however , if you get acquainted with CVS , you can download from there an anonymous package , since &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; b ; -@@ package is . install the package for multimedia from your distribution . if you read this , you probably have done it already ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to persons , compiled by source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help looking for the program to meet your needs when it runs , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs , has many variants of settings . best read the step by step , to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen pictures of the different cardboard cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; hello , still to read ? even if only the help menu was clicked on after the first start of the program , without any clue as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( above all , if at the time of the program starts not audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
&quot; what is it about ? who reads this , probably has already started the program . it should somehow look like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; intended to do it . at least only after contacting the author . and if you read this , he has accepted this section and is therefore agreed with this suggestion . &quot;
&quot; strange if it succeeded in getting the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these information ... &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ a@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ ies ; in addition to others it has with real @-@ time and kar@@ a@@ oke authenticity high@@ lighting also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; it also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ able proj@@ ector , which is needed for CIS cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it is supported a sequ@@ en@@ zer . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color so that it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressing keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so you can move in &amp; k@@ ies ; every MIDI file from one &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window can be drawn to K@@ mid .
supported the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( lyrics or text events ) .
&quot; seat support . if you &amp; k@@ ies , while stopping the finish of a song , K@@ mid starts again next time with the same song . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI @-@ Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , A@@ we , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P drivers and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select Open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you choose the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from one &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will drop . this also works with several songs simultaneously .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and pressing the button &quot; &quot; play in the tool@@ bar , select the listing inser@@ tion from the menu piece or insert the space taste . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts , as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will be added to a collection and then played in succession . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece happens , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive along with the regul@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; when you find that a song is too fast or too slow down , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the tem@@ po@@ on and thus get the play@@ back speed . to get back the original pace , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space taste has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure affects the space bar as a pressure on the button break or selecting the menu entry into the menu item , thus breaks the play@@ back while no piece will be played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; play@@ back . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ ed@@ ly@@ te can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use li@@ ed@@ ly@@ rical event and other both . some pieces have no text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set what events are to be displayed and even better : the Ere@@ ign@@ ist@@ yp is automatically selected , so you have to adjust anything manually . however , in the menu settings the entry Autom@@ atic text output is selected , but you still have the ability to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set a Ere@@ ign@@ ist@@ yp set , select from the menu settings the entries text events or song events . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you put together . these are shown in line . in this section , how you can use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , open first the collection manager . this can be found in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click there on New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection is included in the beginning the same songs as the original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can use the two wished in the collection manager . &quot;
the temporary collection includes all the songs that you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when you exit the application , this collection will not be saved . concerns that when you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button Add a song . it appears in turn the file dialog , with which help you choose the desired song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the automatic transmission to the collection .
&quot; when automatic Add to the collection is enabled , a piece of opening is added to the opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) automatically to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; if Autom@@ atically add to the collection , the opening of a piece is enabled and picked up the temporary collection . this collection will then be added to the further opened pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click on removing . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs will be played . if you select the row after the sub@@ menu subscription sequence of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when you add songs or remove random order in the menu , the order will be re @-@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it within the collection manager , or use the selective list of the kar@@ a@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to make a song further , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu item , or press the button right . &quot;
&quot; to turn back a song back , select the button previous piece , the entry previous piece from the menu item , or press the button left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click on the button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection can not be deleted . however , this doesn &apos;t matter because it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; it is not saved . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers which are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ map General @-@ MIDI events is translated into events that understands the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map showing all the events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always leaves a trumpet if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound card , you do not need a MIDI map , because all Sound@@ maps are GM -@@ compatible ( including A@@ we - and CIS cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so you have to edit the appropriate file of hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI map is a text file , which stores all required compositions for the playing of a piece . &quot;
&quot; each section may appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . prerequisite for this , however , that each appearance has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
&quot; you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a paragraph has been reached . &quot;
&quot; please send me your map file as e @-@ mail , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be compatible with devices that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible . &quot;
in this section the patches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard are displayed . the general use looks as follows :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equ@@ itable sign will be ignored . it is assumed that GM patches are available in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order so no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional Al@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all notes that need this instrument to put on the tone with the number M . if your key@@ board is not supported for example ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which is similar to a gun . to do this , enter the following into the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; so if so , a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( gun p@@ istol ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the note 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term drum patch is meant in which each sound is a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ic instrument ( drum , basin , mar@@ acas and etc ; ) and not the one , in which the sound means the sound height of the always same drum ( as it own key@@ boards ) . &quot;
KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to add as sounds on a specific channel or instrument .
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the order of the lines is very important , as well as their presence . therefore , you must create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names on the first line .
key@@ maps are used above all to make notes on the per@@ cus channel . take a look as an example the included key@@ maps .
this section can be used to switch some channels to others . if you want to s@@ wap the first and second channel in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the perc@@ ussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; n the channel is shown on the Channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map is needed to use the name Name for this channel . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel . in this case , then Patch x is used . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful for example to always use the per@@ cus patch on the Per@@ k@@ Device channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ rati@@ o indicates , in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events multip@@ lies . if a MIDI file is converted a pitch @-@ naming event , this will be re@@ directed at the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file does not stand a dec@@ imal measure ) . &quot;
&quot; this option is needed because GM pre@@ tends to play a keyboard , which is a pitch @-@ naming event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a tone higher . unfortunately , try to find a bit higher with two notes up to an oc@@ tave . to try the correct value on your keyboard , you must try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . this can be found in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings &quot;
the can@@ al@@ view is a window with a whole range of pi@@ vi@@ atures ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on this cl@@ avi@@ ons you can see what sounds are played straight .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list , where you have changed a tool , the button no longer green , but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to preview the played notes . view in the menu settings below the point of channel view : settings
&quot; the pace @-@ LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . so if you find e.g. finding a song be too fast to follow the text , you can slow it . to change the pace , use the arrows on the left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc . so that the same MIDI file can lead to two different devices to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way . &quot;
&quot; good , I cannot force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen when you have a bin@@ der distribution ( r@@ pm , De@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; did that happen , because &amp; k@@ mid ; without as@@ we support compiled . to remove the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s home ) &quot;
&quot; I would like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; do not agree &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or , select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; before , activate the settings to the collection in advance . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can click the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD pressing to dec@@ eler@@ ate the play@@ back . to restore the default temp@@ o you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I got on a &amp; b ; -@@ desktop with my MIDI @-@ folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or downloaded ( if I &apos;d like to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or I &apos;d like to play a file in the window ; only to drag and drag a file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
&quot; if you only want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , switch the automatic transmission to the collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. First you only want to play the first file . so set the adjustment of automatic Add to the collection and open A.@@ Q. Your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; then decide to play C@@ mid and C.@@ mid , and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ? &quot;
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , animated me to program further &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez , in the third year , so I don &apos;t have much spare time for my hob@@ bies ; but I try not to take a bit of time for my hob@@ bies but I try to take a bit of time for my hob@@ bies but I try to make myself a bit of time . as Hob@@ bies I have programming , MIDI files , making music and prove things . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ a@@ oke files if you want a question , a bug or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me simply happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ ho@@ w.@@ es &quot;
&quot; you really make me a great pleasure if you send me a postcard from your home or a MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group , I will send me a postcard or a MIDI file . before you send me a MIDI file , you should contact me , as I might already have the file . &quot;
&quot; I have &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time , and none of it gets money . I therefore want to emphasize that I can only do it further , because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) . &quot;
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wai and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - rec@@ ti@@ fying the error that the pitch for A@@ we cards was too high .
&quot; my thanks also applies Jose L@@ us San@@ chez for testing the A@@ we support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Marc Die@@ ich , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ er , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , a error message or even just a supportive email . &quot;
&quot; and of course , my thanks also applies to all these outstanding musicians on the net , which give us these wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ mid can also be found on his homepage , which is found under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ ver@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . you can also find links to pages with further kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc . &quot;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because sound quality depends much on your sound@@ card . it is not the same whether you use a FM @-@ device or an A@@ we map .
&quot; if you do not have sound card , you have to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you have a sound card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , please contact one of the &amp; k@@ ies ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists or send a error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files from M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD &apos;s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as well ; on this machine was installed .
&quot; for additional help , please refer to the page The K@@ DE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User mailing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made from so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . either , there is a window with the playlist . and finally there is a information window that only then appears when information is to be re@@ bound . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s possible to get the preferred connections between the book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category permanent playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarch@@ ical studio . if you click on an entry , his group and all its sub @-@ groups are copied to the current category and play@@ back starts with the clicked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and permanent playlist can also be changed by default Edi@@ ting the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do that if &amp; k@@ m@@ player , but also through the application itself . simply click on a name of a category cli@@ ck@@ le to select from the menu . by using a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , it must be selected from the menu of the same with playlist and select either the editing mode , or a different category selected . &quot;
&quot; all changes are lost , when the editing mode is left or another group will be selected without having the playlist . &quot;
&quot; owing to the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation during the start and end can be disabled by the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / config option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted simply . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / .x@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during starters needs not to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . however , this would be annoying at the end of the animation , the user can end the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of a favourite photos : &amp; lt ; lt ; lt ; s ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; / sm@@ iled ; / sm@@ iled ; In the source package of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are in the directory tests / some examples of SM@@ IL that are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a rider on the configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here the path can be set from the M@@ player and the cli@@ p@@ allet size of the disk from the network and other things .
another tool for debu@@ gging is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player inten@@ tionally .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured through manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ c . here is an example of a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted in the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; to play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as service provider for the m@@ ime type II / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the furnishings dialog file are specified . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is available in a consoles application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . the gest@@ ed process is called b@@ p@@ player . if there are no mistakes , the back@@ end output is inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to always be taken a pre@@ determined back@@ end for a specific m@@ ime type ( of course , only if this has been identified ) , this must be done by manual change of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ c . for example , phon@@ one should write all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this takes k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be looked , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rek@@ order ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player is to use settings in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ - &gt; X@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ video port , for example , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it . &quot;
&quot; because the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player only can use X@@ video ( probably this type of playing video equipment is also functioning properly ( : 0.@@ 0 ) . for this reason the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server needs to be functional . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 servers must therefore be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; used internally by KM@@ Player for the sources various names are used . at the time of the emergence of this documentation this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ y , dv@@ d@@ source , exact source , source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . when activated , they start playing with the playing of the playlist . &quot;
are there evidence how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / CD@@ ROM is run as user root after the load device . it is absolutely sure to ensure that / dev / CD@@ ROM is pointing to the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
X@@ ine starts to start slowly but why should my CPU be tested on their performance each time ?
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ m@@ t. k@@ x@@ ine@@ Player automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time will test x@@ ine the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user surfaces and network support and is needed to comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ le ; needed .
l@@ atex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems is probably going back to the package &amp; tex@@ as ; respectively . ( for older systems ) .
&quot; most of these components can be included in the &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be drawn . &quot;
the &amp; ki@@ le ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are listed on the ki@@ le ; website .
&quot; this hand@@ book is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; l@@ atex ; , &amp; b ; , &amp; b ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all the suggestions for the documentation must be taken into account . however , the support for this project or its documentation , should be made to contact us via the ki@@ le ; website . &quot;
if you have any questions or require the comp@@ iling of &amp; ki@@ le ; on or are extensions desired , this should be addressed at the mailing list ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ environment for the &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ functions in a graphical interface and within this one simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; l@@ atex programs . additionally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; l@@ atex ; reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and its possibilities to learn should be drawn to Kate &apos;s manual . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can start there directly by reading the chapter &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; Kate ;
&quot; for l@@ atex &amp; l@@ atex ; is the correct footh@@ ills : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . difficult to operate , can also use a La@@ ie ( engl@@ .@@ L@@ ay ) &amp; l@@ atex . a less challenging but realistic survey , is that it dates from the surname of Les@@ lie La m@@ port . &quot;
&quot; if only a good view to &amp; l@@ atex is given here , it is not the ultimate book about it . to be able to master &amp; l@@ atex ; A Guide to &amp; l@@ atex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ er . &quot;
&quot; just like other markings , contains &amp; l@@ atex ; an introduction with which the most gener@@ alized properties like paper format , page numbered and text box starts with the command \ \ review { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ &apos; { document } . &quot;
the fast @-@ level assistant of &amp; ki@@ le ; is a favorite function for the fast creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; it offers some possibilities for the creation of the document . it can also be made some of the document @-@ related settings .
&quot; documentation classes : this is hereby the type of document document , book &#91; report &#93; , book &#91; report &#93; , book &#91; report &#93; , articles ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; Con@@ text &#93; , films &#91; press &#93; , slides &#91; Prosp@@ er &#93; or Custom . &quot;
code : this is the character enco@@ ding . it should use the character enco@@ ding of the system . modern systems increasingly use the UT@@ F @-@ 8 -@@ enco@@ ding as standard . at best , UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ x should be used ( for the correct processing of &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ documents ) . &quot;
this list may contain the mostly used additional packages for &amp; l@@ atex ; . for the involvement they only have to be withdrawn in the check field .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users do not have to worry about it . it is just a short description of the functions and further information on this will be given in the section .
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; offers - just like other source code @-@ editors - the high@@ lighting the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; ki@@ le ; however , it &apos;s not likely to be closed by the humble appearance of the output file . however , you can save it through the modest appearance of output file . &quot;
&quot; by entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ &apos; { command } ) by &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically a blank line ( to enter the text ) , and the added line to the left of the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in full settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands . &quot;
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; l@@ atex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following items ( part is the most common and sub@@ set of the lowest element ) :
&quot; in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed through one mouse click on the respective . &quot;
in creating our own &amp; l@@ atex ; files can be very helpful in creating your own &amp; l@@ atex . D e V ice I n@@ ated File ) &#93; was created &amp; ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DV@@ I ; spect@@ ator on the corresponding line in &amp; l@@ atex ; source code .
&quot; a DV@@ I ; file contains a description of the format document , and also other information such as the font type &amp; tex ; or l@@ atex ; there are many tools to view , conversion and print of DV@@ I ; files for different systems and scent . &quot;
&quot; when using the machine search , the elements of the DV@@ I ; file loaded with the editor and once clicked on an item in the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code is clicked on the corresponding site in the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code is clicked on the corresponding site in the DV@@ I ; viewers . &quot;
master document : this function is used in working with multiple files . with a master document the work with other integrated .@@ tex files will be simplified . when using a project a project @-@ wide master document can be submitted to project settings .
Quick : the &amp; l@@ atex ; code text is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are no mistakes in the source code ) .
&quot; file alert : in this mode the DV@@ I ; file on the , you can read , and there is no call from &amp; Ok@@ ular@@ line ; after quick @-@ speed . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the editing tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be drawn into the document . the first selection field is for the fast structure of the document in parts , chapter , sections , ... The prescribed &amp; l@@ atex ; commands are available for the sub@@ division : &quot;
&quot; the Show more is to include articles such as keywords , fox , notes or references . &quot;
&quot; description : with this command a designation for a section , a picture or any other element is created . &quot;
reference : is used for reference to a specified term ( selection over a selection field ) .
&quot; when using quotation , a selection list is displayed with literary entrances . the author works corresponding editors . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the author can also be written in &amp; ki@@ le ; by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last drop @-@ down with the name of Gr@@ Ã ¼ , is used for determining the font . it can be set the font to the main text , the joints , etc . , there are the following scrip@@ tions to cover : &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; ki@@ le , there are two choices for creating a new document by selecting document species and fixed the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand on hand . &quot;
&quot; the brack@@ ets according to the command \ \ \ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font . if the font is not fixed at the beginning , this can also be done in the text too . &quot;
once the above source code file has to be entered the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code compile will be compiled . the simplest way for this is the use of the menu or the button &apos;s quick @-@ speed .
the source code must be saved in front of the comp@@ iling . &amp; ki@@ le ; for the storage is automatically saved .
&quot; if the comp@@ iling of the document fails , should be sought in the protocol for errors . in case of quick @-@ construction should be started &amp; Ok@@ ular ; automatically this is not the case , should also be considered the protocol . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( engl@@ .@@ environment ) is a text which is treated differently from the same document . for example , a report with the font is created 12 and only a few minutes should be added . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ mer@@ ging { environment } , then encourage the vig@@ il@@ ance of the font within the area . &quot;
the benefits are collected only within the area ( from \ \ &apos; { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) .
&quot; there are many possibilities for heating the read@@ ability and usability of the document . it can be added for example certain fonts , fats , cur@@ ls , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands may end either with the command \ \ , or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
&quot; \ \ &apos; { emp@@ h } : this command is for short @-@ intensive pressure and is long as long as it is closed with a \ \ , { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in one sentence can be displayed with \ \ emp@@ h { word } . &quot;
\ \ &apos; rate : created a quote in the document . the quotation starts with \ \ &apos; { rate } and ends with \ \ end { rate } .
&quot; after the background for writing the source text with the &amp; l@@ atex ; pic@@ torial language presented , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide to create a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; &quot;
&quot; once in the wizard a bit of text was entered , a few adjustments for the better reading of the document should be taken . at this time , a quotation , a few places in fat and cur@@ siveness and a poem should come to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , using editor view or Str@@ g E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , the window must be closed . &quot;
&quot; once the DV@@ I ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and experience it . &quot;
DV@@ I ; is an equivalent file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ essing ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ conver@@ ters or computer screen . &quot;
for the Dru@@ cken of a &amp; DV@@ I ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see below ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DV@@ I ( in the viewer ) can be printed ( if the printer is correct correctly ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DV@@ I ; file into other formats . once the DV@@ I ; file created from the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code created , the conversion can begin by using different formats using the search engines in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the pre @-@ search search allows direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position inside the DV@@ I ; file .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers an appropriate setting for all &amp; l@@ atex ; binary files . there must be only modern under settings to set up ... tools assemb@@ lers .
&quot; to search for the pre @-@ search search , the mouse @-@ cursor must be positioned in a line of the source text and should be clicked on board search . the jump to the appropriate place in the DV@@ I ; viewers will then be analysed . &quot;
with this function in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; with a click of the middle mouse button in DV@@ I ; document the appropriate &amp; l@@ atex ; document by &amp; ki@@ le ; to be specified in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; as a text editor ( settings Ok@@ ular set up ... Editor )
&quot; should the use of fast @-@ speed of the &amp; DV@@ I ; viewers are not possible , there may be a mistake . if an error is available , this will be displayed in the log file or in the news window in summary . &quot;
the protocol file indicates the error source in the source code . in the editor you can see the file &apos;s predic@@ tive La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¤ ster La@@ Te@@ X error for sprin@@ ting . the log file must be clicked on the error in the log file and ki@@ le ; jump to the faul@@ ty line .
&quot; once you have clicked on the appropriate button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the document to be used . &quot;
&quot; when selecting le@@ vel@@ ier document , a document can be used either from scratch or the assistant to the quick creation of a new document . further information is included in the section . &quot;
&quot; previous users of &amp; l@@ atex ; usually use the same introduction for virtually any documents . templates can be stored in &amp; ki@@ le ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / l@@ atex ; file opened or a new file will be created . &amp; ki@@ le ; a new template can be created by typ@@ ing an existing document and select file template . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , some string will be replaced by other data ( e.g. Name or string code ) . these variables can be set up in settings to setup ... settings General . &quot;
&quot; when creating our own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are being replaced : &quot;
&quot; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CL@@ AS@@ SO@@ PT@@ ION@@ S $ $ : this string will be used by the input into documentation class . typically , she is used in writing documentation : \ \ A class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CL@@ AS@@ SO@@ PT@@ ION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard , and the details of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps have been accomplished : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , the own template can be used instead of default . &quot;
a template can be created from any &amp; l@@ atex ; files created . it is a simple way to create a template that should be searched for one on the Internet and searched the steps described below .
&amp; Kate ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programmers with the potential of text files ( including including l@@ atex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . lots of settings for &amp; Kate ; can be made out of course .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and its possibilities to learn should be drawn to Kate &apos;s manual . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; you can start there directly by reading the chapter &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; Kate ;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; offers a very practical &amp; l@@ atex ; command reference , which can be accessed by the help La@@ Te@@ X reference . you can find an optional description virtually all commands , that can be found in &amp; l@@ atex ; use can be found as well as their syn@@ tax . &quot;
&quot; a double @-@ click with cob@@ ble str@@ g button to hide the &amp; tex ; word out . that means that in this way when clicking on \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ , simply \ \ par each . &quot;
&quot; when pulling the text with the left mouse button , the text is automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow buttons , you can choose parts of the source text in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; has the opportunity to search and highlight the most varied kinds of source code . for example , the &amp; l@@ atex commands differ from normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ ae are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; a lot of assistants can also include breakfast marks . this is an own type of book@@ marks within the text . this jumping stamp is highlighted , so that it is automatically used when entering the first type of character . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as &amp; ki@@ le ; although &amp; Kate ; important functions are added to writing a &amp; l@@ atex ; special commands for writing a &amp; l@@ atex ; special commands are added to the selection . below editing commands , the following commands may include : &quot;
&quot; choose a complete paragraph ( group of lines that included on both sides a blank lines ) . with a paragraph , it is not meant to include tables , &amp; l@@ atex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . thus , the only prev@@ ent@@ ative thing in &amp; ki@@ le ; therefore , is that the options are separated by two empty lines . &quot;
&quot; if this selection has an extended meaning , as this command also has a extended meaning , as this command also &amp; l@@ atex ; commands with a random star ( * ) and an extra star ( * ) . &quot;
&quot; to add a part of the document it can be removed , and by the button to be removed . &amp; Kate ; offers the key@@ note of C@@ TR@@ L ; K with which the entire line is removed . below editing , the following commands include : &quot;
removed a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; ki@@ le ; is included in the description of editing items .
&quot; it has already been noted that environments play a central role in &amp; l@@ atex ; therefore , &amp; ki@@ le ; for more commands available under editing environment for a desirable work with &amp; l@@ atex ; &quot;
&quot; with this command , the beginning of the current environment is inj@@ ected ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the order of the surroundings . &quot;
&quot; with this command , the end of the current environment is inj@@ ected ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the order to the end of the area . &quot;
&quot; if the cursor is before or within the command \ \ &apos; { surroundings } , the end of the surrounding area is inj@@ ected ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering the many dev@@ oured ambient commands may quickly go out of the view over . this command has the most recently opened environment , so that the in@@ tim@@ ed ambient structure is not tw@@ isted . &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; l@@ atex ; groups that are determined by brack@@ ets { ... } . under the Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those of the environment .
&quot; with this command , the beginning of the current group is inj@@ ected ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right in front of the brack@@ et cl@@ amps . &quot;
with this command the end of the current group will be scre@@ ened ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right behind the curved brack@@ et brack@@ ets .
if the cursor is before or behind the cur@@ ative cl@@ amps of a &amp; tex ; group # is located at the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; in the entry of many dev@@ oured groups brack@@ ets can be lost quickly from the view over . this command has the most recently opened group , so that the sp@@ ined structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups are not tw@@ isted . &quot;
in &amp; l@@ atex ; two simple matching signs is used as an example . for the pur@@ pos@@ ing implementation is used in &amp; ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; for two simple matching signs will be used . &amp; ki@@ le ; don &apos;t know this case and for two sleeping quarters for l@@ atex &amp; l@@ atex ; one .
this automatic brack@@ et of double size signs can be set up under settings Ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X and will be left out .
you can also use L@@ Ã ¼ n@@ der@@ specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) and thus German or fran@@ chis@@ ees available . there are also many other languages available .
&quot; when Shift is Shift ; input is available &amp; ki@@ le ; a smart po@@ w@@ ling break@@ age . if the current position within a lists environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , is available &amp; ki@@ le ; not only a poin@@ ter , but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
inside a table area slept well &amp; ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ \ with an all @-@ in po@@ w@@ ls .
even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ placed &amp; l@@ atex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be added to settings ; setup ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
&quot; some users want to arrange columns in tables environment and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; ki@@ le ; try to reach each other . although this tab@@ ulator is not the one , for the columns , for the columns position of the current t@@ ul@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; Kate ; already a good source text message has been added , this in &amp; ki@@ le ; for special orders ( usually for l@@ atex &amp; l@@ atex ; ) are working three to need and the other two are available for automatic link@@ ages . all these modes can be set up for different working methods . &quot;
&quot; when you start a new environment using the command \ \ &apos; { surroundings } , &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { surroundings } according to an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; when the R@@ Ã ¼ cke is removed , the last letter of the entry is removed and has been added to the full list . on the other hand , the list may also reduce the list by entering another letter also . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are collected by &amp; ki@@ le ; also jumping marks , so that a simply jump to these positions via editing jumping marks is possible , and the desired parameters can be added . &quot;
&quot; by settings ki@@ le ; set up ... ki@@ le ; los@@ ers can be made to these lists . there can be different wool lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; l@@ atex ; commands , as well as super@@ structure of the general language used . &quot;
&quot; the command &apos;s mode is not random for the completion of environments . on the other hand , the environments will be used so often that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for completion of environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the completed &quot; &quot; Old + Shift key &quot; &quot; button , the command to wh@@ et the environment is automatically added and it appears \ \ begin . after that , the environment can be continued and completed by the entry of the entry . &quot;
&quot; after this accomplished , the environment will be automatically closed again . once &amp; ki@@ le ; recognizes that it is a lists environment , is even a first \ \ item command . &quot;
under settings ki@@ le ; set up ... ki@@ le ; complete settings can be made using these lists . this mode uses the usual mode of compression mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; ki@@ le ; supported user @-@ defined lists of desc@@ ents that are immediately replaced by paraly@@ tic strings . as an example of a mat@@ uring list the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ wl is included in the example of the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
&quot; for example , the letter L entered and the word tagged Str@@ g + Alt blank , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
rough W@@ Ã ¼ nden are not helpful for automatic cont@@ act@@ als . however , it has been noted that many calves in a document has been written more than once . thus &amp; ki@@ le ; the full written do@@ ings already written . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the best settings ... Ki@@ le tra@@ des@@ men can be de@@ ported . here , also the swelling can be specified for the display of completion . &quot;
&quot; full @-@ time files can be installed in the sub @-@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ki@@ le / or / mode / or private home @-@ folder . mode is available for the identification ) , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ Ã ¢ r@@ ter@@ book ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the dialog &apos;s graphics are designed as simple as possible . to view the basics of the basics , these sections should be considered and observed . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as well @-@ known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for download and new orders from pages . will the PDF output can be arranged and then converted with p@@ s@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to be able to examine the results of the work , the source code must be compiled . all components are grouped together in the document creating comp@@ iling , creating and creating view . &quot;
for comp@@ iling of the source text for viewers like &amp; Ok@@ ular ; or the other transformation may be the key@@ note of the old ; 2 to be used by old ; 4 the DV@@ I ; file is converted to a PS file and by means of the old ; 5 the PS file will be viewed .
&quot; when using the command , it is usually called a viewer after comp@@ iling . should not be used a single viewer , each time a new window will be added . &quot;
a new project is supported by the project &apos;s new project .... here the following information is needed for the project :
&quot; when copying the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ ki@@ lep@@ r project file . &quot;
&quot; the script function of &amp; ki@@ le ; allows the acquisition of EC@@ MAS@@ TER -@@ Ko@@ de . the scripts can be managed according to scripts in the vertical bar . &quot;
the API scripts are not available yet and can be found in other versions of &amp; ki@@ le ;
first of all you have to be said that the export environment of scripts in &amp; ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = ki@@ le ) with the following methods has :
&amp; l@@ atex ; is a quite pronounced system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of available packages . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different aids available to support the user .
&quot; &amp; D@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ tual ; you will be supplied with many documents . in this , a documentation contains the included packages and another &amp; l@@ atex ; reference . &quot;
&quot; a full train@@ n@@ z for &amp; tex ; and it &apos;s not just about a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a full operating instructions for the &amp; l@@ atex ; it is therefore ideal for finding a particular form@@ atting . as this is a very large , it will be found in &amp; ki@@ le ; in three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with those &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , the finding of the correct document does not always be easy . as possible help &amp; device live ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k that provides a database with all to &amp; ki@@ le ; supplied documents and thereby a graphic area . &quot;
&quot; all the documents are divided into categories , and the advantage is the search for par@@ qu@@ name or keywords . from &amp; ki@@ le ; then only the results are displayed . &quot;
one double @-@ click with the mouse or the subject of the space em@@ bedding the viewer for the document .
&amp; ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff and user @-@ friendly &amp; l@@ atex ; - / tex ; source text editor that can be carried out on all systems with installed &amp; b ; - and Unix flavor ; also available on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS X features .

often working on a project several people in a type of hierarch@@ ical relation to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project mechanisms can be configured .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Ni@@ ck@@ name is the nickname of the user and serves as a clear identification .
&quot; a member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub@@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can look out from the list of members of the team who is responsible . this happens by searching the team member out of the list and add the button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) will be f@@ ett after you are : text .
nickname and hiring of your own identity are important regarding messages and notes . see for further information on notes .
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team there is another advantage through the capture of the members of the team : it can be an event for information to the team leaders , if something specific is happening . see in for more information . &quot;
&quot; event promotions are actions which are executed when something specific in the project will be done , so that later on , how much someone worked on it , or sending a message , if a file is saved , or a script that is added to the CVS once it is added to the project &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; on the side @-@ configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings Di@@ alo@@ ges can generate events , edited and deleted . &quot;
&quot; an email is sent to the addres@@ see list on the list , the addres@@ see can be a team@@ - or sub@@ project leader . see how to be established such a ladder . &quot;
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
&quot; you can enter comments from the Editor @-@ context menu , or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in an commentary box followed by An@@ not@@ ing ext . &quot;
&quot; notes can be sent to a given member of the team . in this case , the syn@@ tax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , plays a role in the project out of the following possibilities : team leader sub@@ project manager , according to the departments and sub@@ project name , as stated in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nickname and roles names are independent of large or ortho@@ graphy , but spaces to the brack@@ ets and the : make the note invalid . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ tions and form@@ atting languages that D@@ T@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic and web @-@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages supported .
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are dealt with , a short description for the others can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up using settings Qu@@ anta ... called . this dialog extends over some pages that are dealt with each other .
&quot; the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with regard to tags including car complete , the entries are : &quot;
large / Klein@@ ings of tags : big / bin@@ ed by automatically added tags . normal wholesale / d@@ ell@@ ings means that tags are inserted as they are described in the daily XML files .
&quot; large / bin@@ ed by attributes : big / bin@@ ed by automatically generated attributes . normal wholesale / d@@ ell@@ ings means , the attributes are inserted as they are described in the daily XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags : if requested , is available for tags , for which the end day is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
&quot; not optional tags : as above , for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags . &quot;
&quot; start @-@ up and finish tag automatically update : if switched on , the end @-@ end day will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic surrender of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding co@@ ding during the entry .
m@@ ime types : Mim@@ ing types for the detection of different types of files . by means of the default set the default parameters can be restored .
standard string : the enco@@ ding of newly created or in other way as with file opening files ( where the enco@@ ding of the file can be passed ) but this setting will be loaded from the same in the proj@@ ecting properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; default D@@ T@@ D : the selected D@@ T@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ T@@ D is not recognized . but this setting will be loaded from the same in the proj@@ ector , if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; created regularly backup copies , so in case of a black@@ out or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . even for not saved documents a backup regularly will be created . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be shown either in the editor area or in their own view ( or documentation in a cardboard box ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and the source code at the same time . &quot;
set the window settings on the standard back next time is useful when the user interface is come through changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views through each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command parameters .
the warning @-@ range range serves the taxes of the possibility to turn the ad of warnings by An@@ no@@ ken of Not more asking .
&quot; the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be set to display symbols instead of scripts , as well as the syn@@ cing behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source text in its shared mode . &quot;
&quot; here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the figure of the par@@ ser @-@ no@@ des in the document , can be adjusted in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the area of mouse click on the structural tree , the following action makes it possible to change the resolved action by clicking the structural tree with the mouse @-@ crack action . &quot;
&quot; in the area of structural tree settings , the visibility of knot@@ s can be automatically opened in the tree , the actu@@ alization of the tree in the mach@@ ining and how deep in changing the structure tree to be opened automatically . blank no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such an item in which the current document has not been found . &quot;
&quot; the area to capture abbrevi@@ ations ( one type of templates ) that are un@@ divided into mach@@ ining text . abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each one can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s that means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ where abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug @-@ ins are part @-@ applications of third party use , which can be re@@ used by each other part @-@ capable application , at the most known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ ins must be specified as : &quot;
address : the path to plugin if it &apos;s not on a standard tab like $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
&quot; input : this information is transferred to the plug @-@ in to the start , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; component in &quot; &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plugin does not deny the store . only @-@ L@@ esis @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse the shop , if this option is not chosen . &quot;
&quot; check the plugin : is this enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; whether the plug @-@ in information is correct . if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it will be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the debu@@ gging was completely new . Die@@ gger was set up completely new , as well as support for the db@@ g debu@@ gger . instead , a debu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept was implemented , which enables different implement@@ ations on plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plug @-@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; insert . &quot;
&quot; using the debu@@ gger for a project begins with selecting a suitable debu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the button Options next to the Debug@@ ger @-@ Plugin , the specific settings can be changed . &quot;
if a debu@@ gger is enabled for a project appear some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; interface :
a view in which the contents of surveillance variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
&quot; view , in which all Hal@@ te@@ points , with display numbers and conditions are listed . usually , appear in the lower dock . &quot;
one view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the debu@@ gger is usually displayed in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the debu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action the connection to the debu@@ gger , if necessary , manufactured , or it shares the plug @-@ in to listen to deb@@ ited requirements . this action is enabled by default when a project is opened , so that a debu@@ gger does not need to be respected . &quot;
the counter to debu@@ gging session Star@@ te the session . closes the connection to the debu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the foli@@ age to requirements .
send a HTTP request to the server to submit a debit requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to see the current document . the issue of this requirement is displayed in the debu@@ gger edition .
&quot; indicates the debu@@ gger , with the execution of the script and to send information on the monitoring variables as well as the currently running line , the execution will be continued while the execution is continued before a deb@@ tor request is started , the script starts with the request . &quot;
&quot; indicates the debu@@ gger , with the execution of the script to start , without information for monitoring variables and the current poin@@ ter number , the execution runs on . happens before a debit card begins , the execution starts as soon as a requirement is made . &quot;
the debu@@ gger performs the next statement in the script without responding to the functions or includes .
&quot; the debu@@ gger performs the next statement in the script , whereby if possible in functions and includes error . &quot;
notes the debu@@ gger to pass the directive and go to the next so if there were the current ones .
&quot; opens a dialog , in which a variable or an expression can be entered , which shall be monitored . the over@@ crowded value appears in the variable view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable . &quot;

&quot; this chapter describes how you can &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; adapt to your needs , and how you can &amp; # 8217 ; help better to become better . &quot;
&quot; document@@ aries Edi@@ ting packs ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are made in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to give support for Mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages , as well as &amp; CSS ; they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; S &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and &amp; CSS ; s files contain two file types , the &amp; # P@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files included in a document ( above the Edi@@ tier window ) , the text and instructions faster into a document than one user ever could . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ T@@ D . see for details on the conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then install &amp; # P@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool @-@ making . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and the contents of the Fe@@ atur@@ es@@ di@@ alogues . this file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; self @-@ tool make a quick import of tags in a document without any risk of writing .
&quot; day files are nothing but folder . you only contain the &amp; # P@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . day folder carry the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and de@@ aler@@ ted whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so other users have better insight and more information when working with them . &quot;
&quot; the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limitations will be presented in a simple way . &quot;
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only one element type over itself otherwise . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type of Meth@@ od . gives the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a flyer attribute and the attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text into the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ day determined . this is a only element type element .
&quot; describing a attribute of a tag . this item can only once occur for each attribute . additionally , there are more tags to describe how this attribute is to display &amp; etc ; this is a only element type element . &quot;
gives the source code used for filling in the tag @-@ Edi@@ tor@@ dialog and the attribute @-@ tree at the attribute .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p methodology within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the source of data .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments that can be handed over to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container tag allows the elements of a list together . it can only occur for an attribute . it is an only elementary element .
sets the position of the attribute of a tags inside a dialogue . this day can occur for each attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each person ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
&quot; gives the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be available for each field in the dialog once ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; &gt; &gt; Day ) . this element is empty . &quot;
prints a list of elements that may occur within the tags . this element is a only element type .
listed a list of elements that end a day . this element is a only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with a &amp; XML ; declaration start : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 En@@ co@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly gre@@ ased and closed .
&quot; spaces do not influence anything but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; tool@@ tip &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaces , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to verify the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog on top of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and over@@ see tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialogue will appear to follow the simple instructions . &quot;
this function is currently not available . currently , check out only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
in the following an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; diagram &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; diagram . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ day .
&quot; in the following an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP file will be described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ co@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; day name = &quot; &quot; function &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; A ; / day &gt; &quot;
&quot; the &amp; # p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor that can be accessed via D@@ T@@ D Bear@@ be@@ et D@@ T@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly built &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly built &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly built &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; General &#93; version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = D@@ T@@ D / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ T@@ D . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as Ni@@ ck@@ name . &quot;
an action can be set up with settings ... click on New action to the same dialogue :
&quot; the keyboard short@@ cut . with clicking the button user@@ name can be assigned to a keyboard short@@ cut , using one is the current keyboard short@@ cut . &quot;
the simplest actions . it can be entered into the detailed settings and in execution of the action this text is inserted in the document on the current cursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful shareholder type . with the help of this action you can start external applications ( commonly scripts , but it is not limited ) to change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the quick start -@@ dialogue or the different see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
first of all you have to specify the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter . example : S@@ H / home / my@@ Home / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
&quot; though qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts in their path : $ path There are other special variable that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in the case of a local document file : / from the document name .
&quot; % pi@@ d : being replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text Uni@@ que is transferred to the P@@ ID number ; this is useful when D@@ COP is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the external script is used . &quot;
&quot; parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the above methods , a script can move from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; at the default input can be determined . in the selection input can be determined what to send to the default settings . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the conducted application can also be diver@@ ted . there are two kinds of issue : normal output , written on the default output ; error messages , which should be done with the default output written , by selecting the selection field edition : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create tags in logical groups . in a given case , it is not too many , therefore one can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add actions and configure settings . select Settings promotions . &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . pressing the new action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
&quot; complete all the necessary fields , and add them to the appropriate tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; complete all and if the day attributes attributes and you are planning to use their use , activate a dialog &quot; day process , &quot; if available , so that you can enter the entry when using the action . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is that a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? we replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use of the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , graphic other programs ( or where else it is located in its distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day starts , I decided to create a run@@ kno@@ b as a symbol . due to the use of green ( green is usually interpreted as less , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled ; to start the tag in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it needs to be connected to the action . this happens through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . in addition to the text field you will find a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the apply button and continue with other tags , so there is still what are , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to tool@@ bar or it should be used to make a better overview of some separ@@ ators in several groups . open the tool@@ bar to set out dialog on tool tool . make sure the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
&quot; I would like to select the separ@@ ator ( very left above ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element , which is to be added to tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to preview a quick way to access the con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note how to support Tren@@ ner the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar , could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start button . &quot;
&quot; the new tool@@ bar must be tested by proxy for all symbols , to ensure that everything works . &quot;
&quot; back in the right folder . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in the correct folder , but your tool@@ bar ( n ) should be loaded in the right folder . please adjust your &amp; # p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded ( n ) if a file is opened from the corresponding type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most notable expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user , the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ atting language you like . therefore , this chapter describes how to create a &amp; PHP ; document tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could face in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Re@@ pository , whether someone has done it for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to search a existing documentation for the form@@ atting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part we leave you , the second one we treat here . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , for example ph@@ p@@ 42 / # Sec@@ tions Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ tion@@ 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ html Sec@@ tions 1 = &gt; 1.@@ html 2 = tag@@ 1.@@ html &gt; 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html &quot;
&quot; the section tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation : &quot;
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level = Table Re@@ ference Table of content = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction = Re@@ tro@@ duction = Re@@ tro@@ duction = Re@@ tro@@ duction = Re@@ tro@@ duction = Re@@ duction = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax .@@ html ...
please note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Re@@ ference . this shows that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the chess column ( except for reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
&quot; note that the table directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently , at the top of the Bau@@ man@@ tle &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be shown ! ) . &quot;
blank spaces do not affect anything but take care of &amp; and &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; ns ; in all &amp; XML ; resources @-@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resources can be replaced .
&quot; the content section is the area of do@@ cr@@ c file which serves as part of the context @-@ sensitive help . for example , if writing a &amp; PHP ; script for context @-@ help the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context @-@ list ( Con@@ text List ) and the file links . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of supported separate context elements that are to be available ( for &amp; PHP , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c just save to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ or / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( like you specified this in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation were used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Re@@ pository for the use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Re@@ pository for the use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . they will not be rich , but proud to have been proud of the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the ren@@ amed resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tools with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent via e @-@ mail to friends , partners or else to whom . at different locations there is an email menu entry , such as D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool @-@ tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . the contributions are checked and only available when our team needs them to be correct and used fully for publication . thus , the origin of the resources is ensured , both for our team and for later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you are asked about their private GP@@ G Key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys you can search out . in the dialog New resource , the input fields will be filled ( URL preview can remain empty ) and then click OK the high @-@ load . &quot;
&quot; the up@@ loading can upload from the menus D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) high @-@ load tool@@ bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installing , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource is warned by checking the integrity and the signing . if the integrity is given and the resource is correct , a message appears with the specification of the origin@@ ator of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages that is currently not created by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , the creation may be time @-@ consuming , because hundreds of day files will be necessary in tag@@ XML format . there is the simpler way to convert a D@@ T@@ D automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
the conversion can start from D@@ T@@ D store and Conver@@ ting a D@@ T@@ D . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ T@@ D description which is to be used . afterwards the following dialogue appears :
target name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE definition line : the string that appear in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Day as HTML Public / / D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d
&quot; setting the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after the transformation the &amp; the p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand this and get full use of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; so this chapter attempts to bring them closely to these fundamental concepts , without their understanding &amp; tor@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; little benefit . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and proj@@ ect@@ . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are mutually beneficial for each , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; stored , available . by tool@@ ing about promotions , everything is marked as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; stored . this enables the group of administrators to secure different tool , actions and patterns in a global tree , which can then be available in a multi @-@ user environment at the system . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web developers for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool @-@ tool . local elements are stored in the user index so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related items are available only within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool @-@ tools with special actions , specifically for the files of a specific project . simply said , this is the most restricted size . all elements are made in the folder @-@ tree of the project , which provides the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the construction views , the cart@@ els with information and tool @-@ tool . please suggest , and for more information about these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click on the box &apos;s rider with the right mouse button to re @-@ download a context menu with the current document pass@@ codes , re @-@ load , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right click in the editor area lead to a further context menu regarding the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , edit the cursor under the mouse cursor or opening the file , if the string is called a file under the mouse cursor . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the Edi@@ tors there are the tool@@ bar of the editor . currently , &amp; tor@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool can be demonstrated . in the course of further construction of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the tool will be adapted to the new functions and thus associated user needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ making is really easy . if they want to insert a single day , for example , you want to insert the symbol which the day represents , then click on a day that has several attributes ( as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; the construction views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate to the information on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate to open and ro@@ am . in the presentation with cart@@ els stand for files , project , sample documents , scripts , attributes , and documentation Bau@@ man@@ ders are available . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool provided by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view displays all the files in the project and allows the administration of the files in the project via right mouse click . actions such as adding , removal , up@@ loading or delete files from the storage medium can be carried out by the context menu . &quot;
&quot; another option of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all possibilities open . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories depending on how they are used . global templates are always available , local templates only for the relevant users and templates in projects are available only in the project . more about templates is available . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of suspension in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information on a script . about the right mouse button are further functions available , such as the script to start editing , or send by email . &quot;
&quot; in this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by left @-@ clicking an element , the cursor in the document is set to the position of the element . through right @-@ clicks of an element , a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree . &quot;
this tree appears under the other construction views . with it can change some quickly attributes and nam@@ esp@@ ace . this enables the content of all available attributes with a few clicks .
&quot; here you can find complete documentation on the Web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site can be downloaded , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited , edited and considered . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; tor@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two cart@@ els in the lower end of the window can be reached via the beneficial information : the news window and the problem window . &quot;
this card @-@ leader provides information about each in Qu@@ anta current script . so for example the D@@ T@@ D is shown in the current document and all changes to the D@@ T@@ D .
&quot; this card rider shows all errors in the Mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; tor@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed , enter all the error messages ( as there are ) in this window . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ making are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol , and they get the appropriate command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bar is the ability to express their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with em@@ mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as a zi@@ pped T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can secure it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other secure and load ! &quot;
it is reasonable if you want to customize the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; auto@@ graph has a number of options that can be supplied to the configure script . to get a complete list of options available to the configure script . the options are simple to understand and here not executed .
&quot; if you had problems with starting &amp; squee@@ zing ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ ies ; 3 bin folder . also , you should ensure that no older version of &amp; k@@ ts ; 3 in the path before their bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for a fast Web @-@ development and combines a mat@@ ured development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; during making effort , the best &amp; HTML ; -@@ editor to create , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able Mark@@ up @-@ language editor would be ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ ies ! so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summ@@ arized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE should be ; &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; Develop@@ er is based not only this is possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; so as to expand how they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; they allow web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . by using com@@ itted actions , scripts and tool @-@ tool , automation is almost every task possible . through the program you can notice &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ( more about it can be found in . ) &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web developer environment designed for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly expanded to a well @-@ engineered editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developer left the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in detail documentation is with help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; input , or k@@ help@@ center help : / qu@@ anta ) . &quot;

&quot; quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file , which is not on it , with the oldest entry . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use . check in the section about templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project preferences , only a bug is reported . &quot;

&quot; displays the tool@@ bar left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ mark with one mouse click .
&quot; if there is book@@ mark in the current file , it will appear in the menu along with the entries of previous or nearest , depending on the position of the cr@@ abs in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects are saved with the file .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to add files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory to new files that could be there . this enables , e.g. copy graphics files into your project folder , or to add a sub@@ folder , and then add it to the project . &quot;
download the files in your project to the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
attitudes as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in Chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are explained the details .
does a project tool@@ bar . these are kept in project yourself / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
&quot; a dialog , to save your tool . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool bar . this creates only the name . actions must be stored using settings tool , stored or you are asked to save whether you want to save the tool . &quot;
&quot; tool@@ bar removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . it does not delete the hard disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you would like to do that . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to send their own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team , thus the tool@@ bar in the next release present ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as an app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; allows to upload tools to the main server , where anyone can access it . see . &quot;
download a &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; that you or anyone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
&quot; loading of the entities from the &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; can be refres@@ hed , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this globally is and a spelling of the global K@@ DE folder is not present , fails the store . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags , which are available in the currently loaded tool@@ bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the tags menu item that contains the list of tags / promotions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day setup dialog , if there is one . this entry is always available in the menu Tags , followed by &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu . &quot;
&quot; activated or de@@ activated de@@ activated by tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting using tool@@ bar as this day contradic@@ ts the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plugins are listed under the above menu points . click OK . &quot;
sel@@ ects the syn@@ ths mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting does depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
&quot; choose the type of poin@@ ter identification . very useful when you know people , use other OS platforms for the development . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
&quot; checks the syn@@ tax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ T@@ D , using the external application . &quot;
&quot; instant switch between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in K@@ DE libraries , the switch mode can sometimes need time or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the card type mode , which is also default , or the sub@@ window mode , which is the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu includes an entry for each open sub @-@ window . with selecting an entry , the appropriate sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
unlock the status of the status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window .
&quot; the changes in this dialog affects every application using the K@@ HTML @-@ part , including the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
directed the behaviour of the editor . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you will find details .
&quot; a dialog appears , in which you can delete entries from the tool , or which can change and change the sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should create a help in accordance with the mouse of the mouse cursor , but is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; lus &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and free , but as with each open source project the developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form can be found here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory , and should be completed best from top to bottom , for example , after filling the project name the whole directory structure will automatically be completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author &apos;s information panels can later be adjusted with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project to include , for example fo@@ o . when entering its name , file will be filled automatically . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can access the server address of the machine that you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exemplary ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the adjustment of the remote machine , an adjustment could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and default templates . if a common collection of files used for various projects , this folder should be adjusted instead of standards . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which tool can be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files used for various projects , this folder should be adjusted instead of standards . &quot;
&quot; this allows to include files from the local file system to the project , and multiple files or whole folder can be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . with ser@@ ene script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , are to be involved . if a project is newly opened , do not do it . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to di@@ lution . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by clicking it , or by removing the tick , cling from the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be up@@ loaded in the menu with project project properties in the sub @-@ window profiles or with the short@@ cuts Shift ; F@@ 7 will be changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( Plac@@ eholder possible ) that can be re @-@ read with project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
&quot; supple@@ mentary option to top , even files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ors are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the proj@@ ector , which is loaded when opening the project , can be read more about proj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; with this , the desired debu@@ gger can be selected . currently , only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed can be found in . the debu@@ gger plug @-@ in can be set with the button options . in , the debu@@ gger can be described . &quot;
&quot; in the sub @-@ window profiles high @-@ load profiles can be adjusted ( see in ) , as well as the display of a construction point for the content of the server for each profile , by displaying an own building view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub @-@ window configuration , project members can be added , processed or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the sub @-@ window configuration you can switch event actions and add these actions , change or delete . events will be executed when a previous occurrence occurs , such as the She@@ ets of a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , it opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project which was open . this behaviour can not be influenced at present . &quot;
&quot; to open another project , select project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project is displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j than extension . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will automatically be saved . you are asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files will happen . same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project review gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folders behave as well , but you are missing the entries opening and opening with ... in the right click of the mouse menu : &quot;
here you can choose different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the up@@ loading files . see .
&quot; allows the removal of the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button is di@@ ted to prevent the removal . &quot;
&quot; the password is kept in the core memory and forget it . this possibility is useful when frequent up@@ loading files are needed , and the rather unsafe password to save on the record is not available . &quot;
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion before the up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ range profiles can be created and thereby the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded onto different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog will be displayed : &quot;
this is the name of the server to which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address function .
&quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ ts ; and the installed Ki@@ o Sl@@ aves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator operates a service not on the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it after your discretion . the password is stored on the plate , so it can not be read simply , but anyone with programming can easily see it in the plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set of files and tool @-@ tool . it can provide a lot of views in a project , i.e. by simply ex@@ changing the view , various files and tool can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool . &quot;
&quot; views can be saved in the menu or project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings tool tool@@ bar , opened or deleted . &quot;
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ed ; with which one has to do most . this not only helps productivity but also allows adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to their own working method .
&quot; as mentioned above , tool can afford in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best using the tool@@ bar tool can be configured . adding and adding tools differ in the section &quot; &quot; Add tool@@ ing &quot; &quot; section . &quot;
&quot; tool@@ bar and symbols can be set out either by means of context menu ( right @-@ click on tool@@ bar ) , which can be done other actions such as tool@@ bar , tool@@ bar ren@@ ame or tool@@ bar can be made visible to which actions on this or other tool can be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries must remove action and display action to be self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ making and actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tool and set up actions .. set .
&quot; templates are made in the main document skel@@ eton , code @-@ cut@@ lets and files to the link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to link or any one in the system to link existing folder in the anter@@ ior tree ; templates in &amp; tor@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the limitations you can imagine for the fil@@ esystem . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the terms listed at the beginning of each template before using exactly .
&quot; binary is all that is not pur@@ er text . it can be inserted any file out of text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary templates are usually available in documents using direct links ( e.g. pictures with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . further information about the templates is available . &quot;
&quot; documents can be created from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created for the purpose and organized the work in appropriate ways to be efficient . some examples can be found in the sub@@ tree under global templates . see more information on the templates tree . &quot;
&quot; this kind templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted based on a template , but the same text area will always be inserted in the documents to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl . see examples of more information on the templates tree . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates serve for whole web sites as templates . they are a collection of different documents organized in a folder structure , summ@@ arized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; create a documentation Stru@@ cture according to Beli@@ ar ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and choose file as template save as local template .... &quot;
&quot; once this is done , you notice that ( even if it was saved as a repository ) the template is not visible in the project tree . take a look at the screen@@ tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click on file as a template , store selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be drawn with pulling and drop down on the component templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only copy into a sub@@ folder folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as pulling and drop , or inser@@ ting the file tree of con@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in the file tree or in the repository &apos;s files , you can click on a folder to the right and secure site template . by default , it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as local or global template . &quot;
project templates will enable a very pur@@ pos@@ eful way of project . you can insert Head@@ lines and foot@@ er or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create files or link them with them . additionally one can keep some things in mind when using templates in projects .
the sub@@ structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files in the $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / Templ@@ ates / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / log / apps / qu@@ anta / Templ@@ ates / templates / log / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / log / apps / qu@@ anta / Templ@@ ates / templates / log / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / log / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / log / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / log / apps / qu@@ anta / Templ@@ ates / templates / log / apps / qu@@ anta / Templ@@ ates / templates / log / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / log / apps / qu@@ anta / Templ@@ ates / templates / log / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / log / apps / qu@@ anta / Templ@@ ates / templates / log / apps / qu@@ anta / Templ@@ ates / templates / log / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / Templ@@ ates / templates /
&quot; to specify the behavior of a folder , click on the folder with the right mouse button and select in the context menu features . the following dialogue appears : &quot;
&quot; a drop @-@ down with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is distr@@ acted as soon as El@@ ter@@ ous attributes . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and does not fit for anything except the regular folders in the precautions , unless it would be explicitly activated . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text designs . if nothing appears , it is probably in a regular folder . &quot;
permits or edited text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project and allows to equi@@ p a whole presentation to a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ er lines a whole presentation already with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ er lines .
&quot; in addition , we have a context menu ( pointed to the right mouse button ) through a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and paste templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text Editor using the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editing pane in two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; Editor .
&quot; the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : he invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cursor appears . then , you can edit and switch to the source code in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor will be visible in the source code . &quot;
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document that contains &amp; PHP , a small green symbol symbol@@ ises the V@@ oh@@ and@@ yal of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; file editor . there is no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode is just like the first one , except that simultaneously the changes are shown both in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; Editor syn@@ chr@@ ist , this mode is already active , the button leads to the active cursor from one window to another , whereby the position in the document is maintained . &quot;
the synchron@@ ization state between the V@@ PL ; Editor and the source text editor can be adjustable about settings Qu@@ anta ... After choosing v@@ PL ; View can also be set between synchron@@ isation after a click or automatically . in addition the recommendation is set : a small Span@@ ne for fast computer and a large span@@ ish for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website so tools document features can be chosen as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; Editor &apos;s documentation . this is used to change the user &apos;s code . this can change the following :
&quot; met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a items can be added by pressures of two buttons below or removed . one click in the list enables the change of content , e.g. key words on the column names and key word key wor@@ t@@ 2 on the content column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way of designing looking for pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules using the buttons below the list or delete . a change over the list is exactly as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing of CSS rules is not currently supported .
&quot; it is possible to tie an external CSS @-@ style template by pressing on the file @-@ open button , and select the appropriate file . &quot;
&quot; the use of the C@@ urs@@ ors is as possible in a text processing , by filling with arrows . under rare circumstances the cursor works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ed and deleted by default or removal . &quot;
&quot; the inser@@ ting of tags will be made in the same way via tool@@ making , as in the source text editor . it is to note that the inser@@ ting of tags previously are already existing identical tags , e.g. when an anchor @-@ day , will be inserted with text , any other surrounding anchor must be removed . &quot;
&quot; some tool @-@ tools like the tables @-@ assistant or the lists @-@ assistant are disabled . they will be used later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists of tools must be used . &quot;
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for examining style templates . in contrast to other programs for style templates the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style property can be followed .
&quot; to be able to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; do not need to compile , except &amp; k@@ de ; nor the libraries are li@@ b@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ bex@@ s@@ lt and li@@ b@@ x@@ ml , which are already available at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ ts ; &quot;

x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without a file name . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the top loaded style file named x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is loaded for example a sty@@ les@@ see file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ ay .x@@ s@@ l is the following input possible :
&quot; this command is checked on a partial or entire agreement with a pre@@ age called QNAP ME or a specified model name . &amp; eg ; template agrees with each QNAP ME , that contains the string template . &quot;

there are many graphic tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
&quot; the merger was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes while at the same time corrected the inser@@ tion . another programmer had changed much text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts together . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what changed inside these lines . and there was no evidence on the places where maybe only the inser@@ tion had changed . the result of this change was a small nightmare . &quot;
&quot; so , this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could present differences within one line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful features have been added . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want to compare the text quickly , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the previous window . &quot;
&quot; a function that made a lot of work , was the same and merged by folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser . &quot;
&quot; also 3 @-@ ways merged is fully supported . this is useful when two people can work independently from one piece co@@ de and changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously display the result expected . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the scre@@ enshot shows three qu@@ ell files at the same time : &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you perform the same and combined together a complete folder . this screen photo shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when you go together :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and serve with the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you need to check co@@ de frequently , you &apos;ll like this feature . &quot;
differences in white characters and tab@@ s are shown clearly . if lines are only visible in a certain number of white characters you can see at a glance in the column on the left side . ( no trouble anymore if someone is changing . )
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other differs in a row , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name but in different folders , you can make yourself the typ@@ ing work easier by writing only the fil@@ en@@ ames of the first file . example : &quot;
diff@@ 3 Ord@@ inary 1 Ord@@ inary 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ inary 1 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 1 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 1 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 1 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 1 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 1 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 1 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 1 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 1 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 1 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 1 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 1 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 1 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 1 Ord@@
&quot; opening @-@ dialog enables the manual type of fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or select a least recently opened file from the list . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences will be done with two files . &quot;
&quot; through the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or merged by folders . however , if a file is chosen for B and C , however , a folder , then uses &amp; b diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if together , the input field is active and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily required to immediately specify a output file . you can get this step later while saving . &quot;
&quot; the set button opens a dialog with settings . here , you can set options before you start with the comparisons . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to choose text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board to the active comparison window . the comparison begins immediately . in open dialogue , you do not have to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
&quot; you can also use pulling and use : simply drag a file from a file manager , or select text from an editor , and let it fall over a flyer window . &quot;
&quot; what idea is behind it ? sometimes a file contains below several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you would only have to load two relevant files , they are in &amp; b diff@@ 3 ; then you can copy the relevant sections just copy , paste and then compare . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , you can do nothing by &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the fall of text in a comparison window will be supported . &quot;
warning : some editors interpret the pulling and drop of text into another program as discharge and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; in the upper part of each text box there is the info line . the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ames and the poin@@ ter number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) E@@ ach info line has a while on the line . then a small aid window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a color is blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these preferences can be changed via the settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is detected , one sees the color that file differs . if both files differ , the pre@@ defined color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . this is in the next section ( bring together ) well . &quot;
&quot; left beside the text there is the merger column . when differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages , the colour is not so important , it is useful to only see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ essor and in few , rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line that divi@@ des the merger column of the text , is interrupted on the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the poin@@ ter is activated , the line is dot@@ ted at the broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the comparison table ) also has a info line with the writing output : , the fil@@ en@@ ames and &#91; file changes &#93; if you have dealt the result . usually it contains the automatic link already , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are dissolved is save de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons Jump to next detached / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two compar@@ ators are used , each difference is at the same time a conflict which must be resolved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button into the assemb@@ ling column in one of the windows , the first line of the group is displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ) This group will also be highlighted the current group . it is highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black beam . &quot;
sometimes through the automatic merge or no more line left in the group ; this is only a wild@@ card for the case that you change your opinion and perhaps once again select another source . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a mark@@ er that you might copy and paste somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; clas@@ hes ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this feature . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources ignore the options , ignore or ignore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ating is navig@@ ated mainly with the images and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are using one of the windows , you can use the arrow buttons , right , end , Str@@ g @-@ beginning and Str@@ g @-@ end , si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the Aug@@ mentation window , you can also use the other keys to edit . using the inser@@ ting button you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ load mode . ( default is the display mode . ) &quot;
&quot; one click with the left mouse button , in one of the assemb@@ ling columns , synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the start of each group ( as already in the section ) and the edi@@ table output window was explained ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons on navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ below / Str@@ g @-@ Picture ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ below / Str@@ g @-@ Picture ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ below / Str@@ g @-@ Picture ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ below / Str@@ g @-@ Picture ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ below / Str@@ g @-@ Picture ) , to the next / previous conflict . therefore , it must be distinguished between resolved and un@@ resolved conflicts . &quot;
&quot; to copy the marking into the cli@@ p@@ board , you must copy the copy button ( Str@@ g @-@ C or Str@@ g @-@ paste ) . if this enabled , whatever you select , automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board and delete the manual copying . be careful with this option but you could over@@ write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
poin@@ ter are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . Unix variants use a poin@@ ter _ characters \ , and Win@@ 32 @-@ based systems use boot @-@ line \ \ r \ . K@@ de@@ 3 keeps the for@@ ging of the source files . therefore , you should use &amp; b diff@@ 3 ; also not using bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved and restored to the next start . ( menu entry &gt; No diff@@ use ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog represents also fonts with variable width to choose from , you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; when you activate this option , differences are shown in recur@@ sive script . if the chosen script is not supported , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be cancelled . on these systems the button @-@ settings automatically displays an un@@ just color . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , in the pressures of the tab@@ ulator , the appropriate number of spaces are inserted . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator will be inserted . &quot;
&quot; when you press the entry or return , the recording of the preceding line will automatically also be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is activated , each selection is automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . manually copy into the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
you can select which poin@@ ter type you prefer to save . the pres@@ et value is the generally common selection on the operating system used .
&quot; trying to find all identical lines in source files at the same time . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compares each line . in this step white signs will not be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) store a wagon range &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a poin@@ ter &apos; \ &apos; s end , but then files can be treated with different sizes in page @-@ to @-@ page comparison , but then how a white sign will be treated . during which together , this option must be disabled . in default this option is disabled . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis there are numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) . in the outcome , the differences are nevertheless displayed , but they are treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters . &quot;
intensively searching for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in the default setting . it is effective in complicated and big files but slowly at very large files .
&quot; in the automation mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be shown before the next un@@ solved conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; solve automatic all conflicts in white characters by selecting the chosen file as a source . ( default , manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters in many files need less important . note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments . &quot;
&quot; these options are treated in the chapter for scanning , folders and break@@ through@@ s . look for details of documentation on the directory comparison and connection . &quot;
&quot; if a file is stored and already an older version exists , the original version is called Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such a brick file exists with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , this will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; adapting the language of user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you must end &amp; restart , so that the change will be active in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set up globally through the control centre . ) &quot;
&quot; the following co@@ ding settings can be adjusted for each entry separately . if you activate this option , the upper setting will be used for all entries . &quot;
about the selection fields for the co@@ ding appears a brief indication of what the local co@@ ding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal nature . )
&quot; adjust the file enco@@ ding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpretation . as the enco@@ ding is individually adjustable for each file , even files can be compared and merged with different co@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can set here which enco@@ ding should be used to save . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing command , they might not be able to work with your co@@ dec . ( e.g. , your files can be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code ) , but the pre @-@ processing command can only be associated with 8 @-@ bit AS@@ C@@ II . ) With this option one can specify the enco@@ ding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands . &quot;
&quot; turn this off to press high@@ lighting changes in white characters in the text or review split . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments . ) &quot;
&quot; this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode all the differences between two of three files will be displayed . but sometimes you would like to see only the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ b ; C , A &amp; b ; -@@ C , next to the normal still a second over@@ ride column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you would like to use the space available on the screen for long lines . bl@@ ending you simply the less important window . ( this option is located in the window @-@ menu . )
&quot; type the comparison window by side , or over@@ each other . this can also be useful for viewing long lines . ( this option is located in the window @-@ menu . ) &quot;
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and then you decide to merge the files together . a simple click launches the compilation and uses the fil@@ en@@ ames of the last source file as a pre@@ defined name for the output file . ( if this feature is used to re@@ boot the file , then the name of the most recently used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first pass on to this external command . in &amp; b diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor that meets your needs . you can use this function for example to cut trouble @-@ free parts or to correct the inser@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will be given to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command will be used only with the poin@@ ter &apos;s command . you can write your own pre@@ processor that corresponds exactly your needs . each input line must have an associated output line . &quot;
&quot; the thought behind it is that the user needs more flexibility in setting up the Di@@ ff results . however , most users would like to program this program . however , the good news is , however , that in most cases sed or per@@ l is fully suff@@ ice . &quot;
use this pre @-@ editor command for poin@@ ter to convert the input into large letters : sed &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; s text in the upper case letters .
&quot; CVS and other version control systems use some key words to insert automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ \ $ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed , perhaps start to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the Ign@@ ore of numbers is actually a already built function in K@@ de@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further pre @-@ processing command for poin@@ ter . sed &apos; s / / g &apos; Je@@ des sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so practically deleted . &quot;
sometimes you might want to perform multiple compositions once more . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use to separate the compositions of each other . example :
&quot; instead , you can also use something else like per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;@@ s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / switches &apos; aller@@ dings are different for per@@ l some details differently . where kis@@ sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs per@@ l only ( and ) without the requested &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
&quot; the data after the normal pre@@ essor are maintained for viewing and together . further operations change only the data , which sees the poin@@ ter @-@ Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; note : in rare cases when you use a normal pre@@ processor , the poin@@ ter is to see the output of normal Pre@@ processor as the input . &quot;
&quot; the process commands are very useful , but like with any function , the text changes or differences hidden , you can accidentally notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often , programmers need to edit a lot of files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; b diff@@ 3 ; complete folder . &quot;
... make a proposal for each object ; you can adapt the suggestion before the start
... can this be simul@@ ated and shows the simul@@ ated changes without having to perform them
... &quot; selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
&quot; this is similar to the comparisons and combined of individual files very similar . you only need to specify a folder on the command line , or in the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; when three folder are assembled , the folder 1 is used as a base . if no target folder was specified , used &amp; b diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not collapse . to launch this , you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder you will notify you a small message window on current progress . when you cancel the scanning of the folder , only the files are listed until then . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is finished , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ... &quot;
&quot; each file and each folder found during the scan , is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click . &quot;
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded . you can click on a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object , or by clicking the arrow buttons on the left / right . the directory menu contains two functions all sub@@ directories with which you can set up all the folders and folders . &quot;
&quot; click double @-@ click on a file , the file will start straight and it will appear a comparative window . &quot;
the icon in the column name reflects the disk type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the disk type is different in the other folder , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case the merger control action can not be automatically selected . if this is running together , you will be informed about the problems of this type . &quot;
&quot; as in the above picture is to be seen in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black . &quot;
&quot; however , with identical entries , the colour is also identical , even if the age of entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folders are considered to be identical when your entire content is identical . then folders also have the same color . when folders , the age is irrelevant for its colour . &quot;
&quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf again , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red . &quot;
... &quot; A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , this cannot be started . &quot;
... A and B does not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , this cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; the mode for syn@@ cing is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option directories are active . then select &amp; diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folder are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... &quot; A and B exist , but are not identical : together , and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; right after the file copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. ) &quot;
&quot; when two folders are assembled and the option to select new file instead of mer@@ ging ( unsure ) is then analyzed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. If such errors are not fixed , the file cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; while merged , a file named after the other . it &apos;s status column shows you , and according to other messages , if something unfinished , you should make a last review and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if in the furnishings dialog the file comparative method is chosen , K@@ de@@ 3 further columns will display . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , sol@@ itary , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for rede@@ emed conflicts will only be displayed when three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either result in the selected item ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries have one once . if you have selected all the together @-@ to @-@ actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can bring this together . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have not specified any target folder , then in the three @-@ folder mode C , C is used as a destination in the two @-@ folder , B and / or B is used as a destination . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a target folder , check out whether all entries must be displayed in the target folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options to be ski@@ pped through certain entries . check these options to avoid unnecessary surprises : &quot;
to merge all entries together : select the directory link / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . to just execute the current item or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if by conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid actions , a message appears on the faul@@ ty elements . you can select for them a valid action . &quot;
&quot; when you perform all entries , a dialog window appears with the options making , simul@@ ate and abor@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; when you first want to see what would happen , without the really changes made . you will receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; if a manual procedure is necessary with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( summ@@ ing a single file ) , then opens a combined window ( note the scre@@ enshot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are finished with a file , select again directories , or press F@@ 7 . if you have not saved yet , a corresponding dialogue will appear . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; b diff@@ use ; at the end of the list , you see a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem . so you have the option to select another action for entry or resolve the problem in a different way before proceeding with that . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been guided individually , you notice &amp; b diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and execute them at the later result , these entries have been completed or not saved , these entries will change once again . only if you change the summ@@ arized action , those entries are re @-@ assembled . &quot;
setup menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ de@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called directory connection with these options :
only files that fit into the specified pattern are displayed in the elementary tree . you can separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid space holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default file must not match this pattern .
files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree ; it can be entered more than a pattern use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as divi@@ der characters . valid space holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree ; it can be entered more than a pattern use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as divi@@ der characters . valid space holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally produced files are ignored by CVS . the great advantage is that this folder can be adjusted with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( take a look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a self @-@ attribute . in other fil@@ esystem , a selected point is selected . this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the elementary tree or not . this option is switched on in the default . &quot;
&quot; links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links indicate . this is disabled . &quot;
&quot; at links to Fol@@ der : when the option is switched off , the links will be treated like normal folders and checks on possible recur@@ ring . a link to a folder that contains a link to itself , and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; cras@@ hes down . ) This option is switched off in the default . &quot;
&quot; a complete analysis of each file through and displays statistics columns . ( the number rede@@ emed , un@@ solved analysis , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files , which is not included . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern ) . &quot;
&quot; when you compare a large folder via a slow network , it may be quicker to just compare the modification time and file size . however , it costs a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is switched on in default . &quot;
&quot; similarly as confidential from the date of change . there is no real comparison instead . the files are considered to be identical , if when copying the amendment has been lost . please use caution . this option is switched on in default . &quot;
&quot; enabled the syn@@ cing mode when two folders are compared and no target folder has been specified . in this mode , the proposals to merge together are so selected . also the results from the files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in the default settings . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences given , the copying of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this is provided as in@@ secure , because the knowledge is provided that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is switched off in the default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or a folder is replaced by another or deleted , the original version is ren@@ amed with .@@ original extension already exists , this will also affect the normal combined single files , not only the combined single files . this option is switched on in the default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder view remains visible . you can shift the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can switch the option directory &amp; text window to switch window on the window menu and switch between directory &amp; text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file by double @-@ clicking menu . nevertheless , in the directory menu , you can install a single file directly , without first using the folder , the status will be completed and the file will not be assembled again if you run the folder . &quot;
&quot; this status is however lost , however , if you read the directory once again : directory menu : new to read &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO @-@ Sl@@ aves . K@@ de@@ 3 uses this for reading files and folders . this way , you can specify files and folders to opening , which are based on local or remote computers . &quot;
&quot; the first command line compares a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line compares a folder inside a compressed archive , with a local folder . &quot;
a URL has a different syn@@ tax as local files and folders . a few things should be considered :
&quot; a path can be relatively small , or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be mask . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blan@@ ks &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then , a file is accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way of editing per@@ missions or change of change . therefore , the per@@ missions or the modification date from the original . ( note the option confidential ) ( this is only possible in local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose of the main purpose is to start as a difference viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op first always starts the built @-@ in differences . to start K@@ de@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences viewer , and then select in K@@ de@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is applied as a part file , it takes &amp; diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the con@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu in - K@@ de@@ 3@@ Part . furthermore , please note that if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable when the original files have been changed since the patch of the patch file . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; b diff@@ use , it only supports the comparisons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . this merged , or the inter@@ viewer is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ de@@ 2 ( well there are comp@@ are ) there are already . besides , the name K@@ OR@@ 3 already indicates that it can bring together as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I use the GPL @-@ programs very long and have learned a lot while I looked at the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this path or going to go this way .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources , and the configure script probably do not have the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default configure configure / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can not find resources for user interfaces ( e.g. ch@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you can find further information on this issue . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white signs is different , these lines are identical than the same ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is considered not identical . if the lines of next to each other , this is is the purpose this is the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor remembers every difference in the files where he starts and where he ends . however , this important information is lost simply by clicking into the source code and selecting the button A / B / C , and it is a lot of effort to design a separate file format which might save this information . &quot;
the effort for this was so far too big . you can recover a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to process larger amounts of text should be used by another editor .
&quot; after removing text is suddenly he@@ als ; no sr@@ c lin@@ t ; published , and the text cannot be extingu@@ ished . what does that mean and how can this be removed ? &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; used already many colors to highlight differences . even more high@@ lighting would be confusing and lacking the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; take advantage of , you need &amp; k@@ ies ; 3.1 or new . &quot;
&quot; for information , how you can use K@@ OR@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE , you can find on the homepage . &quot;
a list of recent changes can be found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the Ch@@ angel@@ og file in the Qu@@ ell Package .
&quot; to compile &amp; b diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; compile and install , use the following command in the basic folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir is the folder in your system , installed in the K@@ DE . if you are uncertain , you will find more details in RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; there &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ aca uses , you should not have any problems at comp@@ iling . should nevertheless difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ ies ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists . &quot;
cutting ( Str@@ g @-@ X or Um@@ br@@ alt removal ) copies into the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the marked text . insert ( C@@ g @-@ V or Shift lever ) add the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current currency position or replaces the current mark@@ er .
&quot; only differences are displayed : files that are identical in all folders appear not in the folder structure , and consequently also not in the target folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current programme version , you have to re @-@ read the folder after changes to these options . ) &quot;
&quot; it will only display entries to show the differences . this also results that identical files are not merged in the target folder , if the target folder does not already contain , missing it in a later version version . ) This option is switched off in the default settings . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons for selecting the source with the cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are attached from the corresponding window to the end of the selected group in the row window ( if they are not already present ) , they will be removed when clicking the button . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is de@@ activated . under@@ differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; displays a mini@@ ature of all virtual spaces . it is quite convenient to see the ongoing programs on the desktop surfaces , change their size to stop or move it . this works both inside a desktop and at several . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual spaces , as well as those in the running applications . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop . &quot;
with the middle mouse button you can move windows inside &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and other working surfaces .
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked , if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; clicked , the context menu has only been clicked on the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries are minim@@ ising , maxim@@ ising , on desktop and handling . the commands may effect the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of the desktop . appears only when applied to an application .
sends the application to selected virtual working space . appears only when applied to an application .
&quot; this check box is marked , you can move windows inside the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other desktop surfaces . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , are displayed in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of the virtual working surfaces appear . &quot;
&quot; crossing this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual work@@ space display . is it sc@@ anned together with name , be named the names with folders , &amp; eg ; 1 . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also shown as a background inside the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the ongoing programs are displayed as a small window in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty work@@ space is displayed to enable the selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . symbol shows the windows with its standard symbol and pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main window will be determined : classi@@ cally &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2@@ x@@ n R@@ aster , how from P@@ ager applications appear in some other Win@@ dow@@ ner ; wa@@ isted shows all virtual working surfaces in a horizontal row , which is very good for display lateral on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini@@ ature program in the Control bar . it has the advantage that it can display in size , display windows as symbols or with their content . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
right click within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent selection of switch to switch ... makes the dialog settings appear .
&quot; currently , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . but you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / config file with any text editor , such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or V@@ I. If you don &apos;t have any spelling for the file , you have to register as a user root or turn to your system administrator . in this file you must apply the keys of win@@ dow@@ transpar@@ ant fashion and assign it to a value . possible values are : &quot;
&quot; there &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package base is , you need a functional installation of the K@@ DE basic packages . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tool ; em@@ ulates one mouse click , as soon as the mouse cursor was a while at the same point . it is meant to help people who suffer the repeti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and those of which mouse clicks . besides , it can em@@ ulate a bit of exercise . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tool ; can handle the pain that emerges when clicking the mouse is created and helps so many people to use the computer without any pain . unfortunately , you may seek pain using the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this has not yet been done . &quot;
&quot; to clarify it even once again : even if &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tool , pain helps , which is caused by clicking with the mouse , it is against sor@@ eness caused by the mouse , useless . and as with all ergonomic aids : the result can be different for each one . &quot;
&quot; the use of &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tool , monitors your mouse movements and leads one mouse click , as soon as you break the motion shortly . &quot;
&quot; now the smart shift is activated , makes &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tool ; a break , after getting the mou@@ ths of the mouse button . move the mouse out of the mouse button . in this way you can run the pulling out of the mouse button . in this way , you can run the pulling out of the mouse button . this smart shifting requires a little practice , but you get used quickly . &quot;
this delay must be hidden after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tool ; a click @-@ click leads .
&quot; is intelligent moving switched on , the turn@@ around is set up ( 1 / 10 s ) active . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tool ; after downloading the mouse button , before the mouse button is released , if there is no contract for the mouse . &quot;
&quot; this feature is now activated by mouse @-@ postpon@@ ement . if this function is enabled , a slow down to the left and back leads a double @-@ click . these movements are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ mou@@ se@@ tool for the first time , but can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; when the sound appears delayed , you can &amp; k@@ ies ; to shor@@ ten the reaction times . open to sound &amp; Multimedia , choose sound system and here the rider General . there &apos;s a sli@@ der sound bu@@ ffer , which you can adjust to a lower value to shor@@ ten the responses . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , it is selected &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tool ; at any start by &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ ies ; at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please check out the respective documentation to find out how to start there a program . &quot;
&quot; if all settings were set to values , which were set at opening the dialog . have you already pushed the button down , the settings will be reset to the state after the last pressures . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tool ; first using the preferences . in particular , the smart reloc@@ ating should take you first off . if you then hit the automatic mouse button , you can later take the smart shift . &quot;
&quot; when you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the responses from &amp; k@@ de ; in sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window , which do not constitute a link , does not lead to un@@ noticed reactions . therefore , you can park your mouse at such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse sets , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite easy . the trick is that you not just clean the mouse , but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to take the mouse scroll down . as that happens , the mouse is different from mouse to mouse . but it should be quickly clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the sphere was used . the dirt and the dirt , you can easily reach with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ els . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations the operating system breaks the execution of &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tool . if you use this smart shift , this means that &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tool , the operation does not stop by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; this happens when you use &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tool , using another window manager and move a window . &quot;
the solution to this problem is that you can perform yourself one click . this is reset the status of &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tool ; and you can continue to work as usual .
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tool ; continue to carry out mouse clicks and continue the cursor to another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cursor up there , where you want to have it . thus , a accidentally mouse can cause you . safe zones for the mouse @-@ cursor are uns@@ av@@ ed reactions . safe zones for the mouse cursor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bar and menus and the cover @-@ lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the smart shift , but I do not make it to edit the text . &quot;
&quot; the smart shifting is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tool , and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very probably possible to copy it in the cli@@ p@@ board to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board . but it will probably be possible to prepare your mouse again . here are some advice on this : &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t use this smart shift , if you just begin to use &amp; k@@ mou@@ sec@@ tool . highlight the text instead : take a click at the end of the text section , while you move the mouse button down to the other end of the text and push the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . thus , every@@ time , when &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tool ; the mouse button pus@@ hes a sound like a mouse click . so , you know exactly when in the intelligent moving the exp@@ ir@@ ation period begins . later , you can use the smart shifting even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some practice . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tool , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Win@@ dow has to be installed . this should be the case in most of the system . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and loud@@ speaker .
&amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tool ; pressing the mouse button as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor is short @-@ tuned . this program was developed for people who suffer the R@@ SI syndrome and to which the actu@@ ation of the buttons is prepared .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ tool , can also be configured so it is a certain time waiting for a pulling process begins before leaving the mouse button . in this way , the pulling and drop with the mouse can be performed . &quot;

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with which mu@@ te users can let their computer speak for themselves .
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , mu@@ te users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation process , which should be said again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen photo ) enter the command , which later used for the voice edition of text . further details can be found in the description of the furnishings . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the standard text editor . from the text box , you can often select the text passages without having to type them . the text passages can be processed naturally . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen photo ) , you determine the dictionary for the type of words . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can notice the list of words with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , so that only correct sp@@ ind@@ ented words are taken into the vocabulary . &quot;
&quot; the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear , and essentially contains a input field for the ke@@ ystro@@ kes of your propositions ( the lower white field in the scre@@ enshot ) and a pen@@ ess of the already spoken propositions ( the upper white field in the scre@@ enshot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you have k@@ mouth , correct , you can enter the sentences you want in the input field , which you want to hear . each spoken set will be attached to the pen@@ ess memory . you can select from it , which should be said again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth . set up ... open the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth . this dialog contains two cardboard cards , voice output and settings , the page of Wor@@ ter@@ is@@ ation and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the cardboard box , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection field below the input field you place the character enco@@ ding with the text on the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check field , if the text remains unchanged as default to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check field is not selected , the text is passed on as parameter . you can use the following space holder : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to the voice output is dependent on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation of your language generator . examples can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; as a language service is used as a language service , &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the further settings is further developed on this page , and which is currently being developed in SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection process after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the keyboard short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the menu text editor or in the box for text box books . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of instant , the chosen text passage is directly spoken and additionally included in the course memory . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text passage will first only be entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection field of the editing pane for text editor , you can specify whether the text editor will automatically be saved at the closing of the editing pane . &quot;
&quot; with selecting a text editor , the book is saved . if you choose any changes , the text editor will not store , will be stored &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text editor will be saved . &quot;
&quot; the page of Wor@@ ter@@ is@@ let contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the vocabulary . in the main window , next to the input field &amp; k@@ mouth . a drop @-@ down when this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection field you can select the current dictionary for vocabulary . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons on the right side , you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can adjust the language in the input field and in the selection field . &quot;
&quot; select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then reads the &amp; k@@ ies ; documentation a . the frequency of individual words is simply determined by deduc@@ tions of occurrence . in addition , you can compare the wording list with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , in order to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option you can bring the available dic@@ tion@@ aries together . &amp; k@@ mouth , then asks , which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how these weights are to be obtained . &quot;
&quot; with this option , insert a new , empty dictionary with no entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly created words automatically add into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary throughout time . &quot;
the main section of the window for editing text @-@ fit books is two @-@ divided . in the upper part the text box are displayed as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated key@@ code . if you have selected a text editor , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; actions such as new text passages or books , or you can delete selected text passages and books on the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a fold menu . &quot;
&quot; the order of text @-@ fit books or text passages , can be used by drag using the mouse to the new location or with the arrow buttons and the &amp; Alt ; button . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is cut out and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field is a text table , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the publisher is selected . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if the text box is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the publisher is selected . &quot;
&quot; the currently active set is spoken . if text is found in the input field , this one is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the publisher . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is enabled , a postpon@@ able tool@@ bar is displayed with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar can be displayed directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the left @-@ hand side and drag , the tool@@ bar can be moved to a different location . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is enabled , a narrow lead in the lower part of the main window with hints about the condition of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed when not crossed , this status bar is blan@@ ked . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is enabled , a postpon@@ able lease for text box are displayed directly under the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the left @-@ hand side and drag , the tool@@ bar can be moved to a different location . &quot;
&quot; most likely , you do not have the command for the voice output right or not fully entered . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General settings and enter the command for the voice output to further details . ) &quot;
&quot; Festival is a language edition of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ ch are currently supported . the license allows to use festival for free and without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival . the command to the voice output is then : &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a joint language generator . currently , he only supports the English language . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and without any restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice @-@ overs , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et@@ ts . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following commands : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must send data as standard inser@@ tion . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of Ph@@ on@@ emen into a Wav@@ ed@@ ate@@ i , so you need an additional program to dis@@ integrate the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA in assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed .
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to be the last character of the text , so that an additional sign must be added . the full command is therefore elaborate than in the other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written into a line . the option data as default must be switched on .
&quot; the voice @-@ overs from &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; b ; -@@ further language service , which is available to all &amp; k@@ de ; applications are currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice @-@ overs systems . &quot;
&quot; since the voice of language generators only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; to adjust the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth . successfully to use , you need a language generator ( and naturally &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires approximately 15 MB memory ( and additionally storage for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with the people who can not speak to , text by the computer . there will be a list already saved , which the user can always leave again and again . &quot;

&quot; if you have set up at least one speaker , you can set up the registry system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the card &apos;s rider to open this card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; highlight this check field in order to activate the &amp; t@@ ts ; this is successful , the card card orders are displayed and you can read text entries and read the T@@ TS @-@ System from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; if k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr is termin@@ ated , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; next , if the field of speech is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; this check field marks and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr appears in the system of the Control bar , it disappears again once it is completed . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row you can start text entries , stop , stop and resume . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board , or open a text file to read . you can also switch the speaker for an order . &quot;
&quot; click on the application or OK , then all the changed settings on all pages will be accepted . &quot;
&quot; the card card orders is displayed only when K@@ TT@@ SD was started . to launch K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the card &apos;s root General and activate there voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the shown page . then check the text that is to be read , and select in the main menu tools text read . after a short time the voice @-@ overs should begin . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s almost always useful to highlight the desired text of a website . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pr@@ elo@@ ck and other invisible brands can also be read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text shown below . then check the text that is to be read , and select in the main menu tools text read . then the voice @-@ overs should begin . &quot;
&quot; this also works , if &amp; Kate ; in other applications is embedded , as &amp; eg ; in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta ; &quot;
&quot; K@@ not@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ ts ; , which you can notify about from you . you can also read the text of this news from &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; conversation , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set different kinds of messages . you can be notified when in a IR@@ C channel a message appears , in which your Ni@@ ck@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C news text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ not@@ fy , a menu entry fee in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; filters to sign @-@ ket@@ ty offer a good option in &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is a good example . you can fix the tags and b from the news , the put@@ t , and also the expression / local / In@@ box , as this can be assumed in most cases than provided . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for the normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in filters , text is processed , before he will be sent to the program of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unciation to select a suitable language and speaker , or to deal with specific defects of language skills and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of screen re@@ funds has the highest priority . it is presented to all other orders and holds these orders . if the output of screen readers is read , the advertised orders are continued again . &quot;
warning have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and holds the output of messages and norm@@ ative text . these assignments are continued after the warning output .
messages have the next highest priority . a message under@@ breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a web site can be read with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone welcome you just the room . &amp; k@@ ies ; noti@@ fications are also news . read more about this .
&quot; the rest are simple text@@ orders . each order that you encounter from the cardboard card orders is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications that text excerpts are used . text entries are intended for issuing longer texts , which have no special urgency . &quot;
&quot; all four order types are processed in queue , with the exception of the edition of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen Re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such pre@@ reads , this issue will hold and termin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text messages as well as on &amp; k@@ ies ; messages . &quot;
filters edit the text and continue to pass it to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future there can be even further types of filters .
strings replace parts of a text by other text . the plac@@ eable parts can provide you either as words or as regular expressions that enable the definition of chat drinks such as : - ) by text or for the form@@ atting of messages of &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understood form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Re@@ former use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to transform &amp; XML ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files to translate &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML included .
&quot; with Interphone optional filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . if you want to read a female voice for example , you can read text by K@@ DE news about it . Si@@ eh@@ e read about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which he is applied to a language issue . if the filter determines that its rules will not apply , he will keep the text unchanged at the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ or ; sent out , it will be processed by all the activated filters that have been set up in the order in the order from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the designed standard filters . if a filter is not enabled , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the further below are shown below . &quot;
&quot; for setting up string filters , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . these patterns are found in the text , then the text will be exchanged at the corresponding sub@@ text . &quot;
&quot; type your filters a name for your filters . this name allows you to choose , it must be distinguished only by the name of the other filters . &quot;
&quot; this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compares the text with the strings in the column , and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is shown in the order from top to bottom . &quot;
click here to post@@ p@@ one the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save the current list or delete . download a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the available list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language entered here , the filter is only applied if the speaker can be displayed here in registered languages . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click on the &quot; &quot; C@@ TR@@ L &quot; button down . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is only applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separately by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
the user ID @-@ ID run programs will get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ Bus ; number you must we@@ ave . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the applic@@ ator @-@ id copies @-@ 34@@ 32 will only be added .
the string filter filter is applied only to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ alog@@ ous filters when match . are all input fields blank , the filter is applied to all text . &quot;
&quot; when compared with words , the drawing filter filter is used in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must be limited by divi@@ ders ( spaces ) . &quot;
&quot; in this hand@@ book you will find no guidance for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package of equi@@ vocal . &quot;
&quot; &amp; XML ; -@@ Re@@ form@@ ers translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format into another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such re@@ forming . it can only be applied on well @-@ shaped XML . the relief program x@@ t@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system . &quot;
enter the path for the program x@@ t@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ t@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the ambient variable path is also enough x@@ t@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; with the intercom filter you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card &apos;s speaker , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can for example specify that texts may be read from a female voice . see . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text sent to the filters , there is a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker attributes , which indicates the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the properties that are selected on the cart@@ on Card spokes@@ man . with the speaker filter you can over@@ write the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is applied , if the text contains the regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; you can call it with one click on the button to get help while entering . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , begin the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; if the text shown above the desired filter conditions , the speaker will be shown above , the speaker will be chosen to display the desired requirement . click on the button to view the dialog speaker . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your speakers or to delete all settings .
the speaker filter is applied only then to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ et filters whenever possible . you must apply at least one condition .
&quot; the VO API , from &amp; k@@ de ; with the programmer able to lend its applications T@@ TS abilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD above &amp; D@@ Bus ; &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , allowing you to use this synthes@@ izer . &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ ies ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the language output API of &amp; k@@ ies ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the website ( htt@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications demand voice output services via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ops through the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; here is text of the text to read and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands
&quot; open two &amp; console ; window . start at the window in the window , then k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned language skills supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Re@@ former@@ filter created , but when using the module for festival , web pages will not be read . &quot;
due to an error in the festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone to use S@@ able at all . you do not have to do that if you don &apos;t need to use this voice to pres@@ t@@ pro@@ c and find the ambient variable path .
&quot; certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation characters appear to cause mistakes with the synthes@@ izer , so all propositions are ski@@ pped or only che@@ er @-@ wel@@ d . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first , make sure the option character is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . there are problems with certain signs or words , these may possibly be rec@@ tified by a string . &quot;

&quot; the program &quot; &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; uses a adap@@ table architecture to voice . if you want to extend and extend for the use of another synthes@@ izer , please contact the developer team . &quot;
&quot; the program x@@ t@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; -@@ conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ t@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt get install x@@ t@@ t@@ pro@@ c . &quot;
&quot; to compile &amp; kt@@ ts ; do you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including packages and development files for the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source text from &amp; t@@ ts ; downloaded from the source text archive , or have downloaded the program manually , and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , check first , whether speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher works properly with your language skills . therefore , you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ scription SPD @-@ conf . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.@@ 4 is the first version of &amp; t@@ ts ; the program k@@ tt@@ ms@@ gr is so further developed that the application of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is not directly possible and the SPD @-@ conf file is no longer needed .
&quot; a long text is divided into individual sentences . the user may withdraw pro@@ posi@@ tional or rep@@ licate , repeat the output or break down . &quot;
&quot; if an application gives text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; however , it can request an application for example a female English speaker . if you have set up a speaker , whose language is English and whose gender is feminine , this one will automatically choose the best matching speaker . if you want to find out more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker will be chosen , take a look inside . &quot;
&quot; when you click on the map speaker , click Add to add a speaker to the list or click on Edit , the card controller appears to be displayed for Festival Interactive . details of the modules can be found in the following modules . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path leads to festival in path , you just have to enter a festival . &quot;
&quot; select the character enco@@ ding for text which is handed over to festival . in voices , the &amp; t@@ ts ; commonly , this setting will be made automatically . generally , that Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 use , estro@@ genic languages like Czech or Slov@@ ak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders , you can select volume , intercom velo@@ city and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a few regul@@ ator , and this grey will be displayed , the voice you choose to do not use these settings . &quot;
&quot; some votes like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you select this check field , these voices are already syn@@ ced at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so ( with much memory ) the first sentence is synthes@@ ized faster . &quot;
&quot; if this check field can not be selected , you do not yet have a speaker ( or forgotten to apply ) . &quot;
&quot; this is marked with the start of k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr das program window k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , after starting only the symbol k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; this check field marks and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr is not running , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD appears to read a text . this means you have the opportunity to read or otherwise control the text . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders placed in queue , together with the application that has set the order , the current status of the contract , the number of propositions and the just named phrase . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card &apos;s speaker . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series , you can order sat@@ bil@@ ise in the order that is selected in the list below , or go back . ( but not every order is made up of several verses ) . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other card maps ) and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system section . click on this icon to show the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the Sound@@ system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead Al@@ sa , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here are only text deduc@@ tions listed and managed . spending from Screen @-@ readers , warnings and messages are not shown . more information about the news types of &amp; t@@ ts ; find in . &quot;
&quot; choose the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; t@@ ts ; either without support for the corresponding audi@@ om@@ o@@ du@@ l or t@@ ect@@ ts ; can not load the libraries necessary . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for the audio output , select here the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . have Al@@ sa selected , choose the PC@@ M device . see also &quot;
&quot; imagine the talk speed here . 50@@ free ; % corresponds about half and 200@@ nbsp ; % about double normal speaking speed . so these settings can be implemented , the program must be installed so@@ x . &quot;
click to apply the new settings for the current &amp; map ; system to take over .
the list of al@@ sa devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work out . you need to find out which device works with you . in doubt you choose standard .
&quot; on this card , you can set special actions that will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; t@@ ts ; processes four types of language entries : &quot;
&quot; the output of screen re@@ funds has the highest priority . it is presented to all other orders and holds these orders . after the output of screen readers have been read , the advertised orders are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warning have priority the next first priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the issue of messages and norm@@ ative text . these assignments will be resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
&quot; messages may have the next priority . a message under@@ breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you &amp; eg ; just a long text on a website can be read , you can welcome with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone welcome that straight the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen Re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio @-@ overs are in the queue a queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound is active as well , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card will only apply for normal text entries . for messages , warnings and the expenditure of screen @-@ re@@ users there are no special actions , if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ not@@ fy @-@ news , launch k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr and click aler@@ ts . the cardboard card aler@@ ts appears . &quot;
&quot; highlight this check field in order to read the reading of &amp; k@@ ies ; this option is not marked , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; t@@ ts ; reads no aler@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , noti@@ fications , in which a sound is shown , of &amp; t@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list , or delete it . if you click on the button &quot; Add , &quot; a dialogue will appear in which you want to add the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message before , the &amp; conversation , if anyone mentioned in a IR@@ C message to your nickname . &quot;
&quot; all the events , for which in the list nothing else is stated , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
use this selection field to define what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event occurs . you have the following selections :
&quot; if you have selected the defined text selected , enter the desired text . you can use the following Plac@@ eholder : &quot;
&quot; you can enter here the characteristics of the desired speaker . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which will be shown in the list on the cart@@ on Card present@@ er as the top entry . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if for a specific event of any particular application , this action will be executed . otherwise , the action for all other events of the particular application will be executed . otherwise , action is set to carry the action packed under standard ( all other events ) . &quot;
&quot; the event All noti@@ fications for the application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can specify the noti@@ fications as follows : &quot;
&quot; use the button save to save the settings for the aler@@ ts in a file . use the button to load stored settings from a file . if you want to begin with a empty list , click Dele@@ te . all entries are deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for a voice issue . additionally , brands for controlling the pron@@ unciation for example abbrevi@@ ations .

currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following limitations exist :
&quot; you must install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) , as this is the default voice , the festival is used in the SS@@ ML issue . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or sound base in the festival configuration dialog is not on 100@@ N ; % adjusted , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and typ@@ ing filter filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . SB@@ Ds are sub@@ mitting text in individual sentences . this can also begin with the first sentence , not the whole word order . this can also stop or stop and break down , even if the language skills does not support this directly . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the typ@@ ing filter filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set up as a set of typ@@ ing filter filters . you can change its settings , or add further pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters , beginners , however , will get away from it . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn the decor of the speakers by trying out . place the speaker selection , change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker is changing . of course , you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is un@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; t@@ kt@@ ts ; then faster with that can start reading , since only the first proposition must be processed and not the whole word block , which can last very long , &quot;
&quot; you can then stop or cancel text entries on the cardboard card , even if the language @-@ voice does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal pun@@ ctu@@ ality filter filter is automatically set up when you start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
&quot; typ@@ ing filters compare text with a regular expression for typ@@ ing and add a tab@@ ular code ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the typ@@ ing limits ( dec@@ imal code ) are automatically removed from the text ( default code ) , note that the standard type of pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter keeps the character . &quot;
&quot; s@@ b@@ d filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; news ( k@@ ills ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen controller . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed from a normal pun@@ ctu@@ ality filter filter , you can insert this once again by load the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; on the cardboard card of Spre@@ e , you can write the speaker settings for the application . the card card is displayed when &quot;
use of the default speaker ( the top on the card certificate ) . with other words : there are no speakers .
&quot; using the appropriate speaker , which displays all the characteristics of a fully equipped speaker . if you don &apos;t delete or edit the settings of the speaker . if you choose the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker . otherwise choose &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , the most sought after the original properties . &quot;
&quot; select the method to input the desired speaker properties , by clicking on one of the selection settings . &quot;
&quot; choose the characteristics of the desired speaker . if this property does not play a role , do not give anything . &quot;
&quot; highlight this check field , if the property is to take preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set several markings here . &quot;
&quot; since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output is , this property will always be treated as a priority property . the only case , in which you may specify the attribute language , lies ahead when you know that a specific application will be sent in a different language than that of the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all properties in the area speaker , which is most likely to delete the above , click the button @-@ button to use the default speaker , and then use the speaker , which is most listed above . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 is for the last text order in queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number , the input is 0 needed ) . &quot;
k@@ tt@@ o cras@@ hes immediately if it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support but I don &apos;t get any re@@ tracking .
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is cras@@ hed and t@@ kt@@ ts ; probably the command G@@ ST @-@ register is 0.@@ 8 . if the problem is not solved , possibly a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ stre@@ amer may be installed . you can try to update or un@@ install G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio issue over Al@@ sa does not work when I play music simultaneously with another application . if I keep a text order , free@@ zes &amp; t@@ ts ; a message appears on the &amp; console ; appears a message that says : about to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system there is the problem that conflicts occur in al@@ sa , which prevent an simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . notes for possible solutions can be found on the website of the Al@@ sa project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I have downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I have installed it , and can use it in the festival , but k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice . &quot;
&quot; add in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / pen the new voice . as a guide you can use the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developer . &quot;
&quot; on the card &apos;s audio there is a setting speed . so this works , the program must be so@@ x installed and can be able via the environment variable path . some synthes@@ iz@@ ers like Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed . depending on your chosen voice , this active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the talk speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; ( see ) that the HTML can be converted into SS@@ ML . SS@@ ML has its own tags , with which speed control is controlled . ) De@@ activate the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML um@@ former@@ filters , and set the intercom speed up . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t make it to be read with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; t@@ ts ; read the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the Day S@@ able Gender does not seem to work . thus , the festival raises the x@@ s@@ l file for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber @-@ tags . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
I have added a string @-@ chain filter filter and now I can go back in &amp; t@@ ts ; no more sat@@ anic jobs - or go back . on the cart@@ on &apos;s temper@@ ing orders is displayed only from one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
&quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ation signs ( point , frac@@ ture , pun@@ ctu@@ ation , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) you are not allowed to filter . use for these signs instead a filter for the pro@@ posi@@ tional detection . &quot;

&quot; some users experience in connection with Al@@ sa conflicts in the audio issue . if your system also counts , you can not play music at the same time and start reading a text if you stop a text order and then launch another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of Al@@ sa ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; with July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support any real p@@ auses . if you have a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts ; stopping , the current set will still be read yet . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for the general attitude of speaking speed , but otherwise not necessarily necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x with the command apt get install so@@ x . the program is already included in most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs . &quot;
&quot; have you downloaded &amp; kt@@ ts ; as a tar@@ ball ( with tar @-@ packed archive ) , sign up as normal users and pack the tar@@ ball into a matching folder . change to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;

&quot; Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is disclosed . the quality of voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices you can set volume , intercom velo@@ city and pitch with &amp; t@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions that are delivered with festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on the transfer . &quot;
&quot; this voice sets Festival 1,@@ 95 beta or new ahead . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / Russian / Russian / . if you set up the Russian votes , you have to insert for the votes ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . select an ky@@ ri@@ ll@@ ian ( 8 @-@ bit@@ - ) enco@@ ding like for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions as first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 option . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the option must be adjusted to an 8 @-@ bit Ky@@ ri@@ ll@@ isch such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
the Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . then the Festival takes over the le@@ xi@@ cal analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it creates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA is not a complete language system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to create this dialog . Festival creates this by &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; needed Di@@ phon@@ ect@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate from german text files .
&quot; with this method , additional wr@@ ap@@ pers will be added to the festival in order to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files will not be installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; file folder , but in the folder festival / lib / . instructions can be found under &quot;

&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which enables the management of network interfaces , rout@@ ing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; C@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings on a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; C@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; .. &quot;
&quot; this package was developed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , as other settings from the &amp; C@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allow for user to create a simple surface for the following tasks : &quot;
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings is displayed in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by choosing k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; &quot;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware is unable to install . physical devices and their drivers have already need to be functional and configured to be configured &amp; net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and setting up the network properties .
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are added to install &amp; Linux ; installed and set up . network devices are added later , the drivers need to be loaded via the following files , according to the core version . &quot;
&quot; the network settings will be loaded when the option settings settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index selected . when starting the module network settings , it is trying to detect the platform on the system automatically . &quot;
&quot; if the platform can not be recognized , the hanging selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and release entry may be best suited . when setting up the network settings , this selection can be set automatically . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is possible only in system management mode . previously , all options are shown gray , which means the settings can only be considered . in the system administration mode , you can enter the password mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . &quot;
&quot; the rider network interfaces is used to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the rider network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed : &quot;
&quot; the settings in line interface can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button &quot; &quot; button &quot; &quot; setup ... in the dialog device . &quot;
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button . &quot;
&quot; the TCP / IP settings are obtained from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in the automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings will be done with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ O or BO@@ O@@ TP server is required , therefore , no further adjustment can be required . in the selective list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system . &quot;
with the selection manual can be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP address . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified .
&quot; this setting is marked , initi@@ alizing the system interface at boot . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values in this dialog are displayed as qualities of the device in the device list .
it should be assured that the IP address found in the network would not already be used . with ping at an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can notice whether the requested address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched on , depending on required network device . instead , activate a selected network device by selecting from the list and clicking on interface . &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched on , depending on demand . off of a activated network device can be de@@ activated by selecting from the list and clicking &quot;
&quot; sets the IP @-@ address of the machine in the local sub@@ net , which conve@@ ys the physical connection to remote networks , and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub @-@ networks . &quot;
&quot; if at computer there is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the grid in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNA triggers this name into an IP address like about 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5,@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the machine to nam@@ esp@@ ace part of the equ@@ ator solution allows for simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed fle@@ d@@ .@@ DNS entries can be ordered by selecting a single bed and execution , or pen@@ alties in the list with the buttons , or stro@@ lling in the priority . &quot;
by clicking the button you click ... from the group calcul@@ ator to nam@@ esp@@ ouse a DNS server . there will be the dialogue of the new name server .
&quot; first , you must enter the IP @-@ address of the DNS server and then click on the &quot; Add &quot; button . the entry is then inserted in the list . &quot;
from the group calcul@@ ator to nam@@ esp@@ ace you select an entry and then click on the button Edit .... It is displayed to the dialog box .
&quot; the list of specially known computers describes calcul@@ ator @-@ to @-@ IP address for the TCP / IP Sub@@ system . it is used primarily by bo@@ oting , if no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks there can replace DNA servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list contains specially known calcul@@ ators some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . however , this still continues in the test version of IP is to be replaced in the future Version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP @-@ address of the well @-@ known machine and click Add .... The dialog New Ali@@ as will be displayed .
&quot; click the name of the famous computer and click the &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; button . if the well @-@ known machine has several ali@@ as names , de button Re@@ add several times and enter the other alias . &quot;
select an entry of a specially known computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog friend will be displayed .
&quot; one of the following tasks can be executed , then by clicking OK , the list of static hosts will be updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command must be set . &quot;
the website of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source text .
&quot; for installation of binary distribution ( usually r@@ pm packages ) , it is enough if &amp; k@@ ts ; and Q@@ t are installed . &quot;
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the r@@ pm package and in a &amp; console ; with r@@ pm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphi@@ cally interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but in addition , development packages are required with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is only recommended by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ ; the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information on fundamental network technology will be given , in the second all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; change configuration files are being discussed . &quot;
this section can not replace detailed knowledge about IP @-@ networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home @-@ ) network will be conve@@ yed .
IP @-@ networks operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found large spread . from IP@@ v@@ 6 it is expected that it continues in the near future . this description is therefore concentrated on the spread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
&quot; one of the most important information is aware of which IP address is assigned to a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator that may use a valid IP address or if available , can be used D@@ H@@ CP . definitely , the IP address cannot simply be chosen arbitr@@ arily ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up a private small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from an especially for this purpose reserved to avoid IP address conflict with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwar@@ ded on the web , therefore , their use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the internet for such machines can be made possible by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
for smaller networks mostly addresses in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
&quot; in addition , the grid @-@ mask usually is set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so all computers are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ 1 ; .0.@@ 0 and 12@@ 7@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . the standard route is required for IP re@@ directing . &quot;
&quot; the network address 12@@ 7@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address is assigned 12@@ 7@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 in your own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle . &quot;
&quot; in this part , there are the configuration files , which are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes dynamic on DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connections there is another content to be specified there . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , is well known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand is expected to occur as expected . &quot;

&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be taken from &amp; b ; it can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; R@@ ST back the band and reads the pr@@ elo@@ ad of the belt . recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ spell on the tape does not , you will be asked if the band should be form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the spell is looking for the right index on your record . can this not be found , you will be asked whether the band@@ index is to be re@@ created . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , the symbol is changed for the belt drive to indicate that the band was integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the belt can now be brow@@ sed through out of the entry for the band . &quot;
&quot; before throwing the belt , first of all , the integration must be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&amp; k@@ dat ; gives a change of the symbol for the band to recognize that the integration was solved for the band and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
&quot; before a volume of &amp; k@@ dat files can be used , it must be form@@ at@@ ted from &amp; b ; form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; a band @-@ types must form@@ at@@ ted before you can be used to save data . this process does not correspond to the form@@ atting with &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not correspond to the form@@ atting with &amp; k@@ dat ; this procedure usually does not need to form@@ at@@ ted any form@@ atting of the belt , D@@ AT drives however not . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band@@ name and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ atting of the belt . all the data on the tape are lost , the volume is automatically integrated and is ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you encounter the backup process , you must select the files to secure files . this can be done on three ways : &quot;
&quot; select a file or folder in a local file tree , it is saved only to that file or the folder . &quot;
highlight a secure profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile can only be saved .
select files in local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder are saved .
right click on the local file tree and select in the menu Si@@ rag ...
&quot; once the backup was introduced , the dialog settings will open for backup . in this dialogue you can check back the selected files and change the settings for the backup . &quot;
&quot; when you have confirmed the settings , dialogue will appear . the dialogue shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; select a file , or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder has been checked . &quot;
highlight the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
&quot; once the test process was started , the dialog settings will be published for review . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for verification . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog will appear to check . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data set and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can manage the re @-@ establish , the files must be restored , marked . this can be done on two types : &quot;
&quot; select a file or folder in one of the archives , which includes an entry for the belt drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored . &quot;
highlight the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder will be restored .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu re@@ producing ....
&quot; once the recovery process was started , the dialog settings will be released for recovery . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the same folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; when you have confirmed the settings for restoration , dialogue will be re@@ generated . this dialogue shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data set and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the band &apos;s inde@@ x.@@ x@@ file using the band &apos;s contents . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band :
&quot; through this , a backup profile is created with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make a backup profile the following settings : &quot;
the current working folder in which the backup should be done . the list of safety files will be automatically updated accordingly .
&quot; for all the folder which are listed under backup files , that only the files are stored in the same file system , as the folder . folder , which are stored on other fil@@ esystem , can be viewed separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent of the others . &quot;
&quot; perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is saved . only the files have been changed since then . &quot;
&quot; the name of the file , which is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup . &quot;
del@@ etes the snapshot file in front of the call of tar . this causes all files to be secured and created a new snapshot file for the next backup .
&quot; the functionality of the buttons are collected , and lt ; and lt ; files were not yet completely implemented at the time of the creation of this documentation . &quot;
the settings can be set up using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be made :
the full path to the device driver for the belt drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ vis@@ as variant of the band .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the belt is integrated by the command load to the drive . with some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; to block the &apos;s throw at the belt drive . maybe this option does not work with all band@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , when loos@@ ening the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically the band is ej@@ ected . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy streaming . &quot;
&quot; the option switched on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ ships support variable block sizes . no matter whether this option is active or not , you must &amp; b ; in any case the block size for your band@@ work will be disclosed . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ dat ; a band form@@ at@@ ted , it writes a file at the beginning of the belt . this file should only cover a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; the tape ID . the format of this string is z@@ er@@ name : seconds , whereby calcul@@ ator the full name of the system is form@@ at@@ ted on which the tape was form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have been form@@ at@@ ted since the epoch . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .@@ dat files .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can manage directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work , as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the content of a backup member . this symbol is only active if a band is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system prot@@ ector . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where to get information about your system or where the system allows for quick access to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; system log ; is a simplified version of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users who cannot know where to get information about your system or where the system is deposited the different protocol files .
&quot; in addition , &amp; System@@ log ; experienced users give quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore attempts to provide some advanced features which can be fil@@ tered and evaluated with the protocol files of certain programs . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 &amp; k@@ system log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you see in the following screen photo , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available , using their help the single protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily fil@@ tered and sor@@ ting . the individual options for sor@@ ting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start , the most important protocol file of the system - to open the system protocol - it will not display it , and it opens instead of a small message window , so you can log in under Linux in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually no permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter the filter bar , so that only a string will be displayed in the filter bar . in the default setting the drop @-@ off line is displayed next to the filter . then a protocol line will only be displayed when in one of the columns contain the string of the filter key . &quot;
&quot; you can also select another entry at this point . select the string of the filter file . for example , in the protocol file system prot@@ ok@@ oll , select the name of a process , thus showing you &amp; system@@ ically log , all the protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in default setting and helps you detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level error will be displayed with a show@@ y color than protocol lines of level note . the color representation of protocol lines can be switched off .
&quot; if you want to see only certain process ( for example in the system protocols or in the cr@@ on protocol ) , you can select the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process , for example , if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case you can use filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can skip the option to add new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new lines coming in the protocol . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and ad@@ minister . once you have selected a sub @-@ window , select a protocol for viewing . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ actu@@ log@@ .@@ forum software soft@@ war@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; you will also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; Subversion archive : k@@ actu@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ ies ; - Archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the V In@@ it system is rapidly developing for the control of the program start at the high @-@ cycle of the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . this is , because it is easier to use , powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go further into historical aspects ( e.g. because I know nothing about it myself : - ) .
&quot; the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ am and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to make a machine on System V In@@ it , without a re@@ installation and new format . therefore , you need to secure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
&quot; Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it is also different from BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are located directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following other folder : &quot;
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole bunch of scripts . basically , you need a script for any system service that you would like to start using the system or when switching to another Run@@ level . system services do not contain such things as set@@ tes , which will only once started . such calls are to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should lie on the one hand under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if it does not have much use for this . you can also do a r@@ c.@@ conf in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial connection . &quot;
the kernel searches in different places according to the program in@@ it and starts the first one finds .
the default run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point you can throw a look at the second column and probably discover that the pre @-@ placed run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . be very careful when you encounter the system re@@ boot and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how do you start all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to any of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d . &quot;
how does it start and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is written so it is an argument like start and stop accepted . you can actually start this scripts from hand on the command line :
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when a K includes , the script will stop with the argument stop . if he contains a S , the script will start with the argument . &quot;
&quot; some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server running level , that lets you run only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; , network &amp; etc ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult , because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is simple to not say trivial : simply drag an entry from the area of avail@@ able system services to one of the six Run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can move scripts also between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position inside one level by moving it elsewhere . this happens only if they get an entry from the area of avail@@ able system services .
&quot; note : entries are moved , if you want to drag them into a new area . to simply select Cop@@ y from the menu Edit or from the context menu and even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the promotion . &quot;
&quot; the sor@@ ting number of an application can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you will have to edit the sor@@ ting numbers of entries before you can try again to include the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : at present , there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the trash . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ulator key to activate the different work areas ( avail@@ ble system services , Run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor buttons , to make a selection above or below the previous ones . &quot;
&quot; to post@@ p@@ one entry into another Run@@ level , move it with cutting into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ TR@@ L ; X ) and add it to the desired Run@@ level with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ TR@@ L ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sor@@ ting number or the name of a contract manually , press the input button to switch to the properties dialog . use the dialog by selecting the button key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to throw the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the danger of data loss , all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . preferences are taken in the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they are saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; restored changes to the preferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine starts continually new . what can I do ? &quot;
&quot; enter the L@@ ILO Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in the individual user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) . &quot;
&quot; I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; to execute under Run@@ level X , but they will not be executed . &quot;
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ( DL@@ D ) you need to edit additional files in / etc that are present only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual for distribution .
&quot; the way that system services are started in these distri@@ butions , but does not make the configuration for the proprietary programs of this distribution , but unfortunately does not correspond any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an expansion of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use another distribution : please check if all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( like &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ p@@ d ) can be stopped without message if their configuration files are not available or wrong . &quot;
&quot; the importance of the &amp; Linux ; Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , may even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
&quot; after you have made modifications , you must save it . either use the icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry store in the menu file . &quot;
&quot; the main window is an easy application . the main window consists of two cardboard cards , the user and user account list . to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the dialog user and group properties . &quot;
&quot; some cardboard cards are only represented if you have extended system settings ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a cart@@ on card will be created on which you can make individual settings . additional card cards appear , if shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes are installed . &quot;
&quot; the card controller appears , if shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes are installed . &quot;
&quot; this card @-@ card appears only if for at least one single fil@@ esystem space system ( Qu@@ ota ) enabled and initi@@ alized ( recognizable on the file quot@@ as user / quot@@ a group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here , any user parameters can be altered depending on the file limits in KB : &quot;
&quot; these parameters can be adjusted for each file system individually . the current file system will be selected with the help of the field file system , with space constra@@ int . &quot;
&quot; the card group informs groups about the group belonging to the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , you will find in the field prim@@ aries group . furthermore , the user can be a member in the field prim@@ ate group by clicking it in the big field . &quot;
the dialog characteristics of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or a group , select adding from the user or group or click on the matching button on tool@@ bar . editing or delete the selected user or the selected group works an@@ alog@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the L@@ ILO boot manager , remove and modify the boot password , remove , remove , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more . &quot;
