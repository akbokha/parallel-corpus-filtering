<seg id="390">"normalize: this method will scale the luminous values over the whole picture, making it the darkest point black and the brightest point as brightly as possible without its colouring. this function is often a magic correction for pictures that are dark or washed."</seg>
<seg id="391">"same: this method jushed the luminous factor of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of Intensity consists of the same number of pixels. sometimes it achieves the very good results in improving the contrasts of an image, sometimes it also produces a very powerful operation, which either causes miracles in a picture or destroyed it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic paragraph: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright borderland and jushed the red, green and blue-canals to complete histograms."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminosity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values on the greatest possible area and a novelty of all values in between. this is only visible in taped pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white abstain from & digitits; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white abrupting of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white-off correction is somewhat restricted to work via a color room with 8-bit per color. so if you are able to perform too far from original image, in case you are able to perform the white abrupt in the white mode, so your possibilities are correct to correction."</seg>

<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colours gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & proposal came; tools Farming effects presents you four color effects, a solar power effect, a neon effect and a channel filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, Solarization, also called Sabatians, an effect that was created when one developed a partial pressure of a short blitzring and then inverted the development of the picture. the result was a part negatively negative of the picture. this tool permits you to adjust this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar structure. at approx. 50% intensity shows the image which is chemically possible. another increase is ultimately creates a negative picture that does not create a photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar-performance effect. the original image is the (1) and the (2). the effective intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; -effect. it differs from a satiating effect that makes it a stronger contrasts that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simple, he embellishes many photos. "</seg>
<seg id="415">"Velvia is the brand name for a daylight-optimized colour movie which is manufactured by the Japanese company Fujimovie. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and with it a reference for its smooth image structure.

Velvias strongly saturated color, but also some photographs, specially to which the barely deserted landscapes, too much."</seg>
<seg id="416">The neonfilter simulates neonlight to the contrasts. the parameter level controls the brightness of outcome and the sliding repetitions the strength of the neonlichts. with big images the filter can exploit the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to change the color counter and the luminosity of the photos. all your steps can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result you use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can get a photo with bad light conditions you can get the reverse problem: one too large satiation. even in this case the tool for brightness / saturation will reduce a good choice for saturation / saturation instead of adding them. all changes you can perform in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>

<seg id="479">& digitization came; produces three different tools for the edge of the field. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpens is a traditional tool for sharpness. it is very fast and easy, but produces especially in dark areas, grained pictures."</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharpness mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. actually sharpens it rather psychologic Duncan and it makes it a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is possibly the best of the three as it truly enhances the sharpness. it is a little complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus and most of the digitized pictures need a correction of the sharpness. these elements are smaller than the dissolution into a common colour. the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually need more incompatibly sharpness than normal cameras for your private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">"with JPEG images, a camera is often applied in internal field. images in the shell-format however must always be cured in the processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanner can already turn out a focal filter during the reading of the picture. if you disable them, you will get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpens a photo with the focal point of view. you can call it with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">"you should however deal with caution because the results do not work very naturally: the sharpness increases the edge of edges, but also amplify the noise. in general, you can refocus on the menu entry of the tool. under refocus you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques to draw."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than to sharpen. use the tool for soft signs with the menu entry basket. use the effect on the right side of the Dialoges will show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp mask is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview the image will be able to edit. the preview display shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, radius and amount. the default values often create good results and should be tried out first. an increase in radius or amount will reinforce the effect. if you make the insharpness mask to strong, smokes and the impression of grats in close proximity to sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">"the radius represents a large number of pixels on each side of a edge through the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, they should take pictures of the best in their final resolution."</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount will be added to the percentage between the original and the wiped image one of the original is added. this makes the strength of the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the sultry value is a fraction of the maximum RGB amount and the applicable difference. you can therefore define a minimum difference therefore for a channel of filters. in this way, areas will be avoided with a soft switch between the tones of sharpening and hence beauty defects in the faces, Himmling and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the unsharp mask filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). unsharp mask was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a sultry = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & proposal came; tool refocus and focuses on a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright-protected filter filter algorithm from Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to undo a picture on & quot; refocus on this. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. refocus mostly better results than unsharp mask. you can start using it from the menu by drawing colors refocus in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular catch is much better than the Gauß'sche Faltung. the Gauß'sche folding has a very long tail, which depends far from the original pixel. the FIR Wiener inverse is also very strongly influenced by the remote pixels. it causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular fold. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most pictures the default value should result. you can bet a higher value when your image is very blurred then please note to Heiligenvouchers.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artifacts. usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpest effect of the module. "</seg>
<seg id="501">"smoking filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values can reduce values from 0-1. however, values higher than 0,1 is rarely useful. if the noise is too low, the image quality is 0,03. a viable value is 0,03. a high value will be even further entrapped."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß's archipelago. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid poorer artefacts. in most cases you should use this value unequal to zero, so you might also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrightful size: this value determines the size of the transformational size. an increase in matrimonial size can create good results if you choose big values for the circular sharpness or the gauze. in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocus parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to carry out all the cuts, color and intention centers on the picture before you use the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but later left unpleasant artefacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"when you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally unsharp Maskills produces better results than sharpens. this could be causing the unsharp measurging a larger neighbourhood than sharpens.</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, unsharp Maskills must always produce artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of unsharpness. it is practically the result of the FIR Wiener Filters always at least as good as the unsharpness mask. the FIR Wiener filters is often better in the processing of small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small unfocused picture:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color image has to be corrected. this picture has been made with a analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient lighting for the Auto-Focus Linse.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information about the methods for the edge of the archipelago in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">"the regulator smoothes, the insharpness of the area was blacked, in order to generate more natural form."</seg>
<seg id="514">"the color tints enables a customized color for the Pupille. if you want blue eyes rather than dark, then you can adjust it here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image correction is one of the most developed tool to remove the desired artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inqualgorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">"this tool contains different preferences as starters, to simplify the restoration. the available preferences are listed below:"</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to use the filter settings to a jushing you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">"Detailed view p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to a steady smoothing over the image. a value of 0.9 should receive details so that no sharpness is needed."</seg>
<seg id="520">"rifts dependency Alpha [0,100]: a little value smoothes into all directions, while a value close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a movie baskets or CCD Rauschen will create a high value of wave-similar patterns. JPEG artifacts are best eliminated in a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smoothed [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothness factor over allt. p then defines the relative smoothness. therefore, use this value to the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0]: this parameter is greater structures. the higher this value is set, the more it smoothed, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's turbulence effect, he must be higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates on how often the algorithm is passed through. normally there is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">"Winkelempowers as [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropine Alpha. if Alpha small chosen, it should also be small chosen. be sure that small angles can create a long term. therefore, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral parts [0,1, 10]: integral part-wide in pixel. you should put the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel glasses and never greater than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation: the more quality you get through the choice of this option is only low. it doubles but the runtime. we recommend it to let him go out.</seg>
<seg id="527">Buttons Save as and Laden do exactly this. any setting of image errors can be saved into a text file and later loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="528">"image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still last very long and get a high CPU load after you. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button."</seg>

<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you only need the subwindow details and the sub-window advanced settings can remain in default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can drag the image. the area indicated by the radius is moved over the image and the color in it will be smoked, and therefore smaller bugs."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the pixel level. this value sets the pixel out to determine the filter changes. if it is lifted up, smoschtips will be deleted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter images can no longer be obtained and smoketing or scrolling again."</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it's too strong can not remove the entire noise or sound tips can occur. put it on a value close to the maximum when you want to remove a wax or JPEG-artite without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminous: controls the luminous weight of the picture. we recommend you to change color or light density to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothness that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color-tolerant of the picture. we recommend you to change color or light density to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothness that is controlled by the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"Gamma: controls the Gammatoleranz of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerances of the dark areas, which are typically more distressed, but it also lubricates the shadow."</seg>
<seg id="541">"absorption: controls the adjusting of the Phasenjitterdamping. this value is defined as quickly the adaptive filter radius on variations of the luminance. if it is elevated, the edges may appear too high. he can remove noise and phasenjitter at edges. he can remove noise and is the recommended method for this."</seg>
<seg id="542">"storing and store: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for smoking reduction you have set, can be saved into the filesystem and later loaded."</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how smoking reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the correctless marked with (2). the noise reduction has been applied with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than one image to sharpen. use the tool for soft signs with the menu-yield basket and experimenting with the smoothest on the right of this operation shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>

<seg id="1046">"if you choose the first method, POV-Ray moves a beam depending on pixels. if you adjust the difference between the color values to the neighboring pixels, both pixels will be calculated by the pursuit of a certain extra number of pixel with super sampling, then a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a low level of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams je pixels."</seg>

<seg id="1048">Dense = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays depending on pixels. when the difference between colour values exceeds the pre-defined threshold, the pixels will be monitored in 4 sub-pixels, which can be individually pursued and checked for further sub-classification. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the low level."</seg>

<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting yields good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">"--preset standard '= This setting should typically offer transparency for most people and most of the music pieces acceptable transparency, and has already quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality. this is the preferred choice."</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate approximately 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good pleasures for music of young people, portable devices and car-stereosystem. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you want to have absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"the & CD; information which are manually entered into the program from the freeDB program, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can transfer / needed to create folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files."</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with codification programmes, there is often a combination of programs for the encoders and these parameters here. the manual or the aid to the encoders explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"e.g. to add the & CD; title to the keywords (English: day), if MP3s are coded with lame, the switches should be added from & kaudiocreator; the result looks as follows: '... -tt] title}..."</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button-drawing in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"this is what the freeDB is: a free database, in which persons can download the audio CD, so that all others may download the information instead of yourself in the hosts: & CD; title, artist, names of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal, but I am not meant to be attorney. however, nobody can prevent you from the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be added. all information can be obtained from any bumblebee by a & CD; business, physically or virtual."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"in & kaudiocreator; is actively choosing a cross field (sending an address). in this type of configuration, it appears, the e-mail address when retrieving the data from the server cannot be used (This can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)"</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; used for the use of freeDB, the geographically will be used on the next mirror server. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines."</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org delivers a current list of mirrors for online retrieval & CD; information during the reading of a & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) just the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which selection program is used to save pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that it is used to be cdparanoia; who want to know more precisely in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see to be considered that the cdparanoia package has to be installed first if this has not yet been done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"to save the loaded WAV files, the encoders and thus the desired file format can be chosen. at the first opening there are pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a loss-free compression for audio data) on the tab for placing the code. other codes can be added on this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"the Kodizer package must be installed by the relevant Linux distribution, before the encoders can be used. further information about Kodiers are in the chapter Welcher Kodierer."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a code, you can get more information about his switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a solitary window (eg; console). it must be replaced by the name of the installed Kodierers."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"this can have many causes. check the set of equipment drawing of the & CD; / DVD drives, the spelling and readers of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;) installed. try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could give an indication of what is wrong."</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check whether you do not want a copy-protected audio CD; check out the envelope of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">"there is a chapter with one step by step. even if you use other settings, this can give tips how to proceed."</seg>
<seg id="1543">"have read the full manual, everything understood but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step by step example, and you'll get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want."</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example we will start the program for the first time and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' use MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keyword (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">"it must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your machine. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example with a search engine, since it is not necessary to compile the source files, what you can do of course."</seg>

<seg id="1661">In this section the patches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard are displayed. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equitable sign will be ignored. it is assumed that GM patches are available in the correct order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order so no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AlKeysTo M is needed to put all notes that need this instrument to put on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (GM-patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which is similar to a gun. to do this, enter the following into the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if so, a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (gun pistol), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the note 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the term drum patch is meant in which each sound is a different percussionic instrument (drum, basin, maracas and etc;) and not the one, in which the sound means the sound height of the always same drum (as it own keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">KEYMAP section is used to add as sounds on a specific channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the order of the lines is very important, as well as their presence. therefore, you must create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names on the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used above all to make notes on the percus channel. take a look as an example the included keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to switch some channels to others. if you want to swap the first and second channel in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"n the channel is shown on the Channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keymap is needed to use the name Name for this channel. if you are using the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel. in this case, then Patch x is used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful for example to always use the percus patch on the PerkDevice channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderratio indicates, in which ratio Pitch-Bender events multiplies. if a MIDI file is converted a pitch-naming event, this will be redirected at the formula n * (r / 4096) and then passed on. the value 4096 is used so that in the map file does not stand a decimal measure)."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this option is needed because GM pretends to play a keyboard, which is a pitch-naming event with the value 4096 to play a tone higher. unfortunately, try to find a bit higher with two notes up to an octave. to try the correct value on your keyboard, you must try a bit with & kmid;"</seg>

<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list, where you have changed a tool, the button no longer green, but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used."</seg>

<seg id="1681">"the pace-LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the pace of a song. so if you find e.g. finding a song be too fast to follow the text, you can slow it. to change the pace, use the arrows on the left and right from the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc. so that the same MIDI file can lead to two different devices to very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"good, I cannot force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc. you have control over everything."</seg>

<seg id="2083">"global elements are mutually beneficial for each, the & quantaplus; stored, available. by tooling about promotions, everything is marked as global, in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; stored. this enables the group of administrators to secure different tool, actions and patterns in a global tree, which can then be available in a multi-user environment at the system."</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web developers for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and tool-tool. local elements are stored in the user index so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">"project-related items are available only within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; patterns to tool-tools with special actions, specifically for the files of a specific project. simply said, this is the most restricted size. all elements are made in the folder-tree of the project, which provides the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project."</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphic tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">"the merger was very complicated, because one of the contributors had made many changes while at the same time corrected the insertion. another programmer had changed much text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts together."</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program used by me showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what changed inside these lines. and there was no evidence on the places where maybe only the insertion had changed. the result of this change was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"so, this was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could present differences within one line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful features have been added."</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to compare the text quickly, simply copy it into the clipboard and insert it in one of the previous window."</seg>
<seg id="2286">"a function that made a lot of work, was the same and merged by folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser."</seg>
<seg id="2287">"also 3-ways merged is fully supported. this is useful when two people can work independently from one piece code and changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously display the result expected. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three quell files at the same time:"</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you perform the same and combined together a complete folder. this screen photo shows & kdiff3; when you go together:</seg>

<seg id="2291">"if a file is equal, and the other differs in a row, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name but in different folders, you can make yourself the typing work easier by writing only the filenames of the first file. example:"</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer for system protector. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who can't know where to get information about your system or where the system allows for quick access to information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & system log; is a simplified version of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for unexperienced users who cannot know where to get information about your system or where the system is deposited the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">"in addition, & Systemlog; experienced users give quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore attempts to provide some advanced features which can be filtered and evaluated with the protocol files of certain programs."</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 & ksystem log; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you see in the following screen photo, & ksystemlog; functions are available, using their help the single protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorting. the individual options for sorting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after the start, the most important protocol file of the system - to open the system protocol - it will not display it, and it opens instead of a small message window, so you can log in under Linux in the folder / var / log, for the normal user usually no permission to read."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar to filter the filter bar, so that only a string will be displayed in the filter bar. in the default setting the drop-off line is displayed next to the filter. then a protocol line will only be displayed when in one of the columns contain the string of the filter key."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can also select another entry at this point. select the string of the filter file. for example, in the protocol file system protokoll, select the name of a process, thus showing you & systemically log, all the protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in default setting and helps you detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level error will be displayed with a showy color than protocol lines of level note. the color representation of protocol lines can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to see only certain process (for example in the system protocols or in the cron protocol), you can select the process identification (PID) in the column process, for example, if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the samba server. in this case you can use filter bar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can skip the option to add new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new lines coming in the protocol."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"& ksystemlog; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and administer. once you have selected a sub-window, select a protocol for viewing."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / kactulog.forum software software.org. Dort you will find more information about the sources of & ksystemlog;</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you will also find in the following folder of the & kde; Subversion archive: kactulog; in & kies; - Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the V Init system is rapidly developing for the control of the program start at the high-cycle of the system in the & Linux; world. this is, because it is easier to use, powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects (e.g. because I know nothing about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the init binary file is under / sam and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to make a machine on System V Init, without a reinstallation and new format. therefore, you need to secure that the old init was removed from there if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"SysV Init is also different from BSD Init, that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are located directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following other folder:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole bunch of scripts. basically, you need a script for any system service that you would like to start using the system or when switching to another Runlevel. system services do not contain such things as settes, which will only once started. such calls are to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should lie on the one hand under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if it does not have much use for this. you can also do a rc.conf in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial connection."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in different places according to the program init and starts the first one finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point you can throw a look at the second column and probably discover that the pre-placed runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. be very careful when you encounter the system reboot and execute the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how do you start all the right scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to any of the scripts in the directory init.d."</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stops init actually system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is written so it is an argument like start and stop accepted. you can actually start this scripts from hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and when a K includes, the script will stop with the argument stop. if he contains a S, the script will start with the argument."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server running level, that lets you run only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc;, network & etc;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">"here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult, because the program was created as user-friendly as possible."</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six Runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can move scripts also between Runleveln or change the position inside one level by moving it elsewhere. this happens only if they get an entry from the area of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved, if you want to drag them into a new area. to simply select Copy from the menu Edit or from the context menu and even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the promotion."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an application can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you will have to edit the sorting numbers of entries before you can try again to include the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: at present, there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the trash. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabulator key to activate the different work areas (availble system services, Runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor buttons, to make a selection above or below the previous ones."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to postpone entry into another Runlevel, move it with cutting into the clipboard (you can also use CTRL; X) and add it to the desired Runlevel with inserting (with CTRL; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of a contract manually, press the input button to switch to the properties dialog. use the dialog by selecting the button key to accept the changes, or press Esc to throw the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the danger of data loss, all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preferences are taken in the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they are saved by & ksysv; restored changes to the preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I experimented with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine starts continually new. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">"enter the LILO Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in the individual user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order)."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have provided some system services with & ksysv; to execute under Runlevel X, but they will not be executed."</seg>

<seg id="2986">"the way that system services are started in these distributions, but does not make the configuration for the proprietary programs of this distribution, but unfortunately does not correspond any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an expansion of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you use another distribution: please check if all configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (like & eg; Apache and httpd) can be stopped without message if their configuration files are not available or wrong."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the importance of the & Linux; Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, may even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel so that this manual can be added to this manual."</seg>
