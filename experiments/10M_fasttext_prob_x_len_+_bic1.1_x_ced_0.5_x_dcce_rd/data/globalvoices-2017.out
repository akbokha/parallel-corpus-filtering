although I had visited the USA at least once a year I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely great .
&quot; like many of my generation I have grown up with American movies , danced to American music , American writers and practiced his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as an 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , who covered with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as the Jura @-@ president , who was the Supreme Court with judges who were til@@ ted to his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to Meth@@ od Man , &quot; I was &quot; s as if that is the absolute truth , forgot everything else that is what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , had even strengthened my admiration for the US . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you are always that you are and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even had a very strange love letter written about its size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the xen@@ ophobia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he is moving with a narrow @-@ face .
he never stops behind the mountain with his opinion as one says so beautiful .
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks of how a former colleague put it , and explained publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ US and Women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted for him in she@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes , which he won during the republi@@ can elections , was the highest number that has ever achieved by the party Candi@@ date candidate . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans , who support this big@@ otte person , asked me ? &quot;
I was able to trace Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; as for example my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journalist &apos;s program , the people from all over the world participates , a deep natural person with whom I was talking about Islam and its past . &quot;
&quot; the m@@ ist world@@ view not coinci@@ ded with the name of Peter Bh@@ atia , the present editor of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bh@@ atia and I met our joint love for basketball , and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ umps In@@ tolerant is also in contrast to generosity that I experienced in Sandy , who fights their lives long the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me as their son . &quot;
she also adap@@ ts to the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of American life .
&quot; then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise counsel helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the values embo@@ died by them are deepening my love for America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump finds its way to nom@@ inees republi@@ can Presidential candidates , she offered me a grip and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly White , the Presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t for non @-@ white men . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people have voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to overlook these things , broke me almost the heart . &quot;
maybe it is unfair to design@@ ate the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as se@@ ists .
&quot; to arrange people , one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
&quot; this is superficial and respectful , and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way . &quot;
it shows the people that their worries and fears are not taken into account about the h@@ ectic changes in their communities .
&quot; could it be that these voters are , of whom most knows , for tr@@ ump , because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might want to say that in this America they are still important ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick that comment@@ ated the cruel decision to rise up a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t for those who look different than him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; ( An@@ k@@ m. ) . : as much as &quot; &quot; drawing up the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; &quot; fore@@ play from white in suits on the White and whi@@ plas@@ h , which means as much as s@@ ling@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) as it did the great Van Jones , has made exactly what America has done so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background you may have always , America welcomes everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; with the election of Donald Tr@@ umps , there is a huge part of the white America that promise this promise and says : to Hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America to 9 / 11 the white man is back on the ruin , say it . &quot;
&quot; with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who had fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
on a manifestation of Hill@@ ary Clinton Mr. Khan had a change of change with the crowd of men .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have been my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a onom@@ ic &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; brood the crowd . &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; answered them . &quot;
did A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ?
&quot; no ! &quot; wars , they and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
would anyone who is not like you to have a place in your America ?
&quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and onom@@ at@@ ted &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tr@@ umps , &quot; the message said . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America . &quot;
and this breaks my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ an city C@@ ate@@ au@@ ra together ?
&quot; the music that is played in both places is not only the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a big garbage dump ; only 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; an old colonial city that is popular among tourists -@@ but worlds from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
&quot; for some years now , La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Music Association ) has been playing a sym@@ ph@@ ony orchestra in the municipality : one of children and adults with the existing Symphony Orchestra , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become central interest for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drugs abuse and gangs . &quot;
&quot; but after a random encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project and the youth began such a rare hop@@ eless@@ ness . &quot;
the young band@@ members take their commitments to the music group very seriously - writes local press not@@ ci@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
&quot; once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to go to their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come and play with shiny eyes and play in the Tru@@ bel you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ colo , clar@@ inet , flute , forest horn , flo@@ cks , Bon@@ go and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from the rub@@ b@@ ish
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ au@@ ra - a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments that are made of rein@@ for@@ dable waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re @-@ prepared instruments made from local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ au@@ ra , where the recycling led by F@@ avi@@ o Chávez have begun to transform parts of the waste in instruments . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ itate G@@ ot , viol@@ a , C@@ elli , double b@@ asses , guit@@ ars , fl@@ utes , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets and perc@@ ussion , which were all made out of the trash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles , of Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article of Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o Chávez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician instructor for the children of C@@ ate@@ au@@ ra , at the beginning of the time : &quot;
&quot; first , it was very difficult because we had no space for rehear@@ sals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the rub@@ b@@ ish . children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact parents , because many of them do not live with their children . &quot;
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : one from waste @-@ made violin .
&quot; today , there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments from re @-@ prepared material and that The recycled Orchestra is called . &quot;
a documentation called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ical garbage dump ) draws the musical performance at :
the world produces approximately one billion tons of garbage each year .
&quot; those who live with him and of him are the poorest , like the people in C@@ ate@@ au@@ ra , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspiring spectacle from trash to music around the world .
the orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing is fighting .
&quot; this article , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports international , practical solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
re@@ publication happens within the scope of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for shared usage of content .
&quot; in West Africa was then known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing , before it was looking for the other coast of Africa . &quot;
&quot; the East African countries had therefore killed and little inclined to welcome a bre@@ wing of these kind at its coasts . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seychelles mobili@@ zed themselves up against the ship . they refused to place one of their har@@ bours and refused to give him a fishing pack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; suddenly , the Prime Minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused everything , &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a deputy of the Ken@@ yan fisheries authority . he is part of a team that discovered the ship at the time and followed . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of pl@@ undering of fish stocks of the country . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , criminal practices crossed and protecting resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal fisheries ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that had exp@@ elled the Premier from their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; we have eight countries who are like co@@ ined and working together . they exchange information and stand each other when it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally F@@ ishing . this project provides F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
illegal fishing is regulated by definition un@@ regulated : what is captured is hidden because it is extremely difficult to trace . thus the illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing regions .
&quot; by the inten@@ tional cont@@ emp@@ t of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecosystem can harm the illegal fishing ecosystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while action against illegal fishing were once handic@@ apped by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also through the sn@@ ails , the actions occurred today in real time , with trac@@ eable at F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , the individual countries can exchange other lists of existing licenses , news for suspi@@ cious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port review . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive , when they move on the open sea , via satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to identify the authorities , ships which fish in bot@@ ed areas - such as such that indicate that a ship loads his captured fish on the road to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence where they were travelling and possibly also if they have a pen@@ ny . &quot;
&quot; countries who are against illegal fishing can deny the adoption of such vessels in their ports . what does the ships do not sell their cargo . and that they could even be forced to pen@@ alties for pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is then about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , manager Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a couns@@ elling company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the aforementioned platform has been created to gain estimated 20 million USD in lost turnover , which will lose eight members of the Network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year because of the illegal fishermen who penetrate into East African waters . &quot;
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish farms that attracts commercial fishing from around the world . this also includes these illegal fishermen .
&quot; their practices include actions like the sailing under false flag , counterf@@ eit lic@@ ences , stating by fanta@@ sies , the fish protected species and the fish in nature conservation areas . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they targeted the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non @-@ complete control system &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; in the past a ship could not fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &quot; You can &apos;t stop my harbour . &quot;
but another country could say &apos; come to me &apos; . &apos; and just this leg@@ ale lo@@ p@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now .
until now the closed front works .
since its inception was F@@ ISH @-@ i involved in more than 30 investigations of susp@@ ects ships .
&quot; it has uncovered criminal networks , distributed counterf@@ eit lic@@ ences in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has start@@ led ships to be followed and found . &quot;
&quot; due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the International Authority to combat crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information about illegal fishing through large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us pretty much into the networks organized crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that is to help the F@@ ISH @-@ i @-@ susp@@ ects ships more precise .
photo with kind permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which will always be further developed , also helps to trace the illegal ships that likes to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . and that we try to cross , &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Che@@ fan@@ aly@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at tracking , an NGO who also deals with fisheries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships turn off for example , their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be Georgian . &quot;
&quot; Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that combines various information levels with each other . it aims to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find crimin@@ ally active ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform for Global F@@ ishing Watch with Google and the Sea protection Organisation Oc@@ e@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and by means of which the position of every single trac@@ eable ship can be displayed worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; gather together with neighbours to get a better picture of what is doing - this simply meaning &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and gather their resources to investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable trusts has a similar project to run , in which a global system allows the persecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only feel crime , but they are also deter@@ red . &quot;
&quot; ships , formerly un@@ exploited and hardly to reck@@ on with consequences , know now that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating at F@@ ISH @-@ i have since increased a 33 % increase in fishing sales , since fishing boats more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia , Gre@@ ko 1 had set up , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tow networks , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo with kind permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars disappear through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; there are six countries joined together in 2015 , so called West Africa Task Force . now they are fighting illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH . &quot; &quot; With safety , the goal is to develop even more such initiatives and structures also in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country of Somalia was able to report his first major triumph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was on the wrong flag , and not only was the ship without a license and were hau@@ led tu@@ pp@@ nets , which are now prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also penetr@@ ated in the bot@@ anic waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the taking of action against Gre@@ ko 1 they set a strong sign that it will proceed against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special , collaborative effort to protect the oceans actually works . Emma Br@@ yce is free professional journalist and lives in London . there , she writes on the subject of environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and The Guardian . location in Venezuela is more pointed to : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of re@@ capture the country &quot;
the movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations .
they are regarded as protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum for the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela had rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum for Ministers , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in their eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country in which they assembled themselves on the streets . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the retreat of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate is also led in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the region of Mé@@ rida and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the central north @-@ north Bundestag Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country is deterior@@ ating continuously , which makes itself noticeable in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans through an acute lack of food and medication . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition appeared in the ministers of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , the chance of a fundamental change ; however , ultimately , the res@@ ignation of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Marianne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , takes up in her latest article on the context of the government stream in this way : &quot;
&quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and violence has become the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious lack of food and medicine , the referendum was considered to re @-@ conquer its institutional structures and to close a new governance . &quot;
&quot; the prot@@ esters of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : r@@ under table of the Democratic Unity ) , in which the demonstrators are led to the majority of representatives of the opposition . in addition , the demonstrators had planned to join the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro as well as a march to the Miraflores palace , the Venezu@@ elan Government seat , on November 3 , should continue to persist . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :
&quot; it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday national , civil strike and on 3 November all after Car@@ acas to the Miraflores palace . &quot;

&quot; the first demonstration within the framework of the Action programme &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 . October . &quot;
&quot; the pictures from the mar@@ ches which are published in real time , testify among other things a overwhelming participation of the people in many areas of the country , but also disputes with poli@@ c@@ emen as well as advocacy group of the government . &quot;
&quot; one of the most shared images shows a demonstr@@ ator that calls through the protected signs , &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I have hunger ? &quot;
&quot; will you kill me , because I have hunger ? &quot; , &quot; did this Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans . &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , pictures show paintings made by disputes , as well as reports of repression and abuse . &quot;
&quot; particularly big waves , the message suggested over police repression in the central north @-@ north of Mar@@ ac@@ ay . &quot;
&quot; there they returned to the local cathedral , in order to protect themselves from the police and armed endor@@ sement of the government . &quot;
&quot; hours later they could leave the cathedral again , but the protests went further . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstrators were trying to stop police forces , including these women in the Andes @-@ state T@@ á@@ chir@@ a : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a carry not a skirts , because otherwise you could see something that many nation@@ alists do not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an Info@@ graphic is already the round that forms the scale of repression per day : &quot;
so the dictatorship has sup@@ pressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a minister of ministers - this has now been proven in the eyes of many innum@@ erable people on the street .
My@@ te@@ k &apos;s Media Labs :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dad@@ o claim that 1 % of the sig@@ natures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your ministers !
on the road !
&quot; others have taken these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which made a little bit of the devastating economic crisis from their point of view , and rather deal with critical voices : &quot;
they have taken us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches always take more in frequency and intensity .
&quot; some Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans reported the media , they are hungry to participate in a strike , rather than working or shopping . &quot;

the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly approval .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; now , when adult man told Qui@@ j@@ ano as part of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Córdoba , against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the process , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
&quot; starting with the office , the same name as his father contribute to the brutal military operations in the prison of La Per@@ la who he observed at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough . &quot;
34 years he kept the family secrets for himself .
in the situation then I believed that was fine .
I felt like a wal@@ k@@ ent .
&quot; as a child with 15 years , one cannot realize that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; I could not recognize that at that time , that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ terer and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was gendar@@ me officials . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of State Department , his father from 1976 to 1978 has been Deputy commander of the secret services Department 141 in prison La Per@@ la . &quot;

from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father ki@@ cked me to the military base , I often went with us to the sports hall . there I had gotten myself with a boy who made combat sport . &quot;
all n@@ anned it &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; I told my father about him and some days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo , and asked me to identify my friend . &quot;
he said :
&quot; you are an Ar@@ sh@@ ole , you have been friends with you by the ERP . &quot;
&quot; passport only on that she will not lead you one day , and I will then save you . &quot;
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo - revolutionaries army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &apos; party in Argentina .
therefore he offered me to go back into the sports hall . several days later he took me to work on the military base .
&quot; he said to me , I would become secret . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . because my Father had moved me .
in the military base I had to destroy paper that had heard the prisoners .
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda , propaganda , books , just everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ there the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la with - all in 1976 .
&quot; on the first and last time , he left me at the entrance in the car . &quot;
&quot; when he took me the second time , he commanded me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rage , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible - stood . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small wrapped wrapped , and ordered me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day , I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen items were put down , and signed me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; I se@@ wn in and saw a song , tor@@ tured on the people . &quot;
she looked like a field cot and metal springs .
later I found out that she fortified the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was captiv@@ ated there .
&quot; she rarely finds a man with towel to the bed , kis@@ sed him with water and said to him a load of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the st@@ ank there was horri@@ fic ... like a fil@@ thy wind .
&quot; years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget that smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do with another so much suffering ?
I knew that these people were killed &apos;
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were arrested . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilians who also was charged in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people were captiv@@ ated with the face down - all were captiv@@ ated in hands and feet .
near the entrance to the entrance hall silent on the mattresses .
&quot; when my father noted that I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; What do you see so , Ar@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; so why did you otherwise have brought me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know this because my father told me of it .
&quot; in addition to La cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and k@@ ills .
&quot; ( according to the survivors of the civilians , Jorge Rom@@ ero who was also charged with La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) . &quot;
&quot; the following video brings Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of the memorial La Per@@ la , through the former Fol@@ ter@@ chambers . &quot;
&quot; the way that you came in here is also the way to which the kidn@@ apping came here .
&quot; when you look at the map , see that she took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
&quot; here , their names were changed and they were assigned to a number of the process of de@@ human@@ ization . &quot;
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of above came to be moved . &quot;
this was the lie - the euph@@ em@@ ism - for the completion of men and the disappearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; War ute &apos;
my dad brought all kinds of stolen things with home .
&quot; at that time at the age , I had no idea of what the &quot; war story &quot; - as it was named . &quot;
&quot; but when I was later by the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - was clear to me that war was a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military characters , which one takes an enemy to combat . &quot;

&quot; but when one walks into a house and the fridge , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... sti@@ cking , then this is not a war , but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always asked me how my father , the leader of security forces , with this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t understand it .
I was officers in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and to ste@@ al all of it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I answered , and thou that thou do@@ est cars on the road ? &quot;
you are not a crime ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded before anger , struck me and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and bring you stub@@ born . &quot;
&quot; to do so , we need nobody else ! &quot;
so my father was .
I have no good memory of him .
&quot; when I was out in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I carried a jacket and a truck pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes to home . &quot;
&quot; then I accused the defense of being a pity of this crime . I resist , no problem , they can put me to the burden of what they wanted . &quot;
anyway I was there to express .
&quot; the extravag@@ ance of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act &quot;
&quot; now , where I am older , I find repentance . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if you only have children , one sees the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and re@@ alises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you have ex@@ iled during the dictatorship of people . but why the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children have ent@@ ail ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl with his home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked myself the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could have put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
did these people not also had families to have passed their mortal rem@@ n@@ ants ?
&quot; the extravag@@ ance of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act , which one can do to a human being . &quot;
&quot; my father told me when the democracy was introduced again , they took machines to eliminate the mortal rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they have been ad@@ mon@@ ed and somewhere disp@@ osed of , no idea where . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; &quot; said my Father . &quot;
but anything remains of course always .
I have seen how you killed people !
just to clarify it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crime - including my father .
&quot; the thought of view my father was created during a conversation , when he stood under house arrest . &quot;
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atrocities that I had to experience because of all the atrocities .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ wardly led and asked me , why the whole exaggerated patriot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; they were supposed to have defended themselves . &quot;
then I cried out :
how can you tell what to me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed horrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; he rep@@ lied only &quot; &quot; Well , then me &quot; . &quot; &quot;
that is what I did .
in 2010 I saw the first ad .
I was finally recognized that he was a criminal .
nobody can blame me that I am taken . I finally said against my own father .

the judg@@ ments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magnitude of the Ur@@ als .
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been heard , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera ended between March 1975 and December 1978 , crimes against 7@@ 16 victims were eventually committed in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 op@@ pres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . the Court engaged in 28 cases of life @-@ long arrest , and in nine cases of adhesi@@ on between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there was no release . &quot;
eleven of originally 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ mission : murder , torture and rape by ministers . # Es@@ war@@ ster@@ ism &quot;
&quot; all the def@@ endants were during the dictatorship members of the military , including former military members , former police @-@ members and civil employees . &quot;
Piero De Monti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he directed the following words to the silent Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a factory factory designed by un@@ human heads .
the court appearance is a historic milestone for all human rights organizations that have been working for years for justice for the victims .
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the 1995 @-@ founded Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people who were murdered during the dictatorship or disappeared , said : &quot;
&quot; the trial lasted more than three years , but the research for this lasted 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ inian government launched the country on which La Per@@ la was built , so that a memorial site could be built there , which are now led by human rights organisations . &quot;

a translation errors makes older people in Kyoto too &quot; terrible drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation errors in a center in Kyoto where one can extend his driving licence .
the photo was distributed in social media .
editing of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can prolong his driving licence , in the last month witnesses a very different translation . &quot;
&quot; on a sign the Japanese word has been read , the Japanese word ( Cor@@ ei@@ ghs sh@@ a ) , the &quot; older drivers &quot; means , maybe but maybe even with arches , but also translated with bows &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; as &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the false translation was to read on electronic ads on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
revision of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine divided in the social media .
&quot; the error was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os , who made his attention to the local time . &quot;
the daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that nobody has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city such as Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . &quot; &quot; the label &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the proper name &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the Pre@@ fecture deadline for the translation errors . furthermore , it declared that the error was already contained in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not tested on their correctness before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we are sincere , that older people felt by insufficient correction ( the translation ) of our part , &quot; said the Police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News took a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; terri@@ bly &quot; was denoun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police the share of older drivers , the country is still involved in accidents , but quite some occasion for concern . &quot;
&quot; in Kyoto , for instance , 1.@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 4@@ 60 oun@@ ces of seniors have been caused by seniors in 2005 . this represents a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , the elderly caused 1,@@ 80@@ 3 from a total of 11.@@ 850 oun@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; thus , their share rose to 17,@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents decreased overall , the proportion of seniors caused by seniors in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the named re@@ porter did not mention the re@@ porter published in the article published on Yahoo , which show which prejudices some Japanese , apparently against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo on the translation errors , among other things , was given the following comments : &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; faul@@ ty is the translation actually at all , or ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t find that this is a real translation errors . &quot;
there are no such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in Asia
translation errors are widely used in Japan and Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real finding for these bizarre mistakes in English .
photo of Flickr @-@ User Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; to survive , one needs two important abilities : passive language skills to understand the output text and active language skills to transfer him to the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that is the case in parent &apos;s language . in general , the conviction that translators in the target language - should not be in the initial language - maternity language . &quot;
&quot; thus , a French mother language would translate into French for example from English to French - not from French to English . &quot;
photo of Flickr @-@ User Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as a mother tongue , which might produce translations into English . this may result in mis@@ understanding of the superiority , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers , the Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies that do not have foreign employees themselves , translations nevertheless make fir@@ ing internally . then , the Japanese employee , whose English skills are considered to be the best - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;
photo of Flickr @-@ User Karl Baron .
mechanical translations are also widely used - often with fun results .
&quot; the dist@@ res@@ sed and pu@@ zz@@ ling sentences , which arise by mechanical translations , show that this technique can be replaced by no human translator for a long time . this is particularly true for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the strange English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints , often used T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;
photo of Flickr @-@ User Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors like jewelry is still acceptable or at least harmless . but by large companies or from the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot;
the Kyoto city will hopefully use a reputable source of its translations in the future .
Venezuela : take protests and cens@@ ored actions on the internet and on TV
&quot; head of the Port@@ als &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Frei@@ ght surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , 7 April , the Venezu@@ elan Internet users have no access to the online channel vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet site of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV is no longer accessible . &quot;
other on @-@ channel broad@@ cast@@ ed recordings of protests in Car@@ acas were organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups which contradic@@ ted itself by the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
&quot; the protests started in early April , after the Supreme Court has dissolved the Parliament and transferred the tasks of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is purchased , and recommended the users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet . &quot;
# cens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ elan provider are again locked .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with internet access , especially in times of unrest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media since 2014 have been hesit@@ ant on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission voted for telecommunications to them with fin@@ es and lock@@ ings , if they continue to report on the demonstrations , since the Commission looked at this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that this continues to be cheaper than two lit@@ res of le@@ mon@@ ade to buy .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ ks later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by a block of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two additional online transm@@ itter . this also concerns the Internet site where the National Assembly transm@@ its its sessions . &quot;
&quot; past tut@@ ors of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique , by which the DNS server requests from certain domains can be answered wrong . &quot;
&quot; if an Internet page is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ dent or denied the request when calling for such an Internet page . &quot;
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
&quot; on V@@ PI@@ TV , a third closed channel , the transmission was set on Thursday , the 6th of April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman Elvis Flor@@ es , who carried out the protests in Car@@ acas , was taken in custody . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police .
&quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went back to broadcast . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : thus the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans of access to multi @-@ media coverage on current events in the country is still further developed . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to get a training &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child a cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house in which she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collects testimonies of other cri@@ adi@@ tas that were just as they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a student report , published by Global Vo@@ ices with kindly permission of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series titled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ lying Mas@@ k@@ ine , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) , which is edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household in which they did not live together with the family who lived there .
&quot; shortly before her graduation , she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about it . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; that , from which something has become , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began to work as cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as cri@@ adi@@ tas one is in Paraguay that are more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money , giving her inferior son or her under@@ age daughter to another , richer family . in exchange the child receives food , training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned is that the children need to do innum@@ erable days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be held - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted up . &quot;
this practice known as cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large sections of society and despite many complaints from human rights organisations .
&quot; after completing their studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
she spoke with cri@@ adi@@ ta - especially young girls affected by the practice of cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gathered testimonies testimonies , researched and p@@ ran@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name things at the name , because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated to the cri@@ adi@@ tas , is guaranteed to be silent in general . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family , who is their daughter in believing that they complete their training , improve their position in society and can make something out of it , to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who ackno@@ wle@@ dges the girl and justify its exploitation with the belief that they would give someone a chance that otherwise wouldn &apos;t get education and maybe even star@@ ving . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is dis@@ missed , his family will only be experienced many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never know about it .
&quot; in January 2016 the previously relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú in the hospital , her body showed traces of fierce beats . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former Mil@@ or@@ ran@@ ged Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as a be@@ amer by the residents .
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small place with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometres east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira proposed a stick to Mar@@ ín until they suffered deadly injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations like UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deeply rooted practice of cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go to the death of the girl .
it marked the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest and called for there to be no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay are more cows registered as children , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to un@@ det@@ ects the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded a special investigation into the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was to be sentenced to 30 years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; if the case comes to judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín will be ad@@ mis@@ sive - when the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go to judgment . &quot;
the everyday life of a cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as labour force , they also live isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , where her father worked , she had to register and lost her father his work . &quot;
&quot; their brothers had to go on all of them , and began to sell on the road or on the market sweets , to make money . &quot;
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ on in the capital of As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
she had to share the time so that you still have time to learn .
she stood at five o &apos;clock in the morning and prepared the breakfast for their employers .
&quot; for example they puri@@ fied the fridge , put the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was finished , she went back home and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more they were finished with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says , she never had to star@@ ve , but got also not unlimited . &quot; &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge , &quot; she recalls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ isers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; in some bot@@ tled waters of the house@@ holder Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him and Editorial from Op@@ position@@ ings such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; to read . &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them to make no faith in the official media reports of the regime of the dict@@ ator .
&quot; he held it for intelligent , but did not with@@ stand up with her . &quot; the house@@ holder had someone found who spoke to him while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they allowed me not often to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would like to learn &quot; &quot; poor habits &quot; . &quot; so she said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belongs to the indigenous group of the Guaran@@ i , at home again their native language . &quot;
&quot; their Lord was afraid that they had the formation , which they had enabled them to lose again , explains it . &quot;
&quot; her , however , was absolutely clear that they had paid for everything they got from them , who had paid their hard work . &quot;
&quot; also in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated discrimin@@ ated . &quot; a matter about which almost never spoken , har@@ ass@@ ment and the ra@@ ils are exposed to those cri@@ adi@@ tas when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents , a cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to my home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in time , where friend@@ ships develop , I felt particularly clear that I was not part of any group . &quot;
&quot; the insulation was the worst of everything , &quot; says Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
the Society sanc@@ ti@@ fies the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can view vac@@ ancies for cleaning personnel and child @-@ animals in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the administration of the group is PE@@ PA Cos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city group in the district of As@@ unci@@ on . &quot;
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .
to learn .
please forgive you .
&quot; starting from Monday , if possible . &quot;
the ad got five &quot; Li@@ ke &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the village of Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a little @-@ year girl and gave their phone number .
&quot; another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; &quot; wrote them . &quot;
&quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; a girl from the inland , which wants to work . &quot;

&quot; dear friends , I found a found . I look at whether it works with it . &quot;

&quot; in the course of our history we managed to establish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the history of Paraguay , the Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores who had to ens@@ lav@@ ed the Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores ) and the system of Men@@ s@@ ú ( a economic system ) during the Spanish conquest , in which the Spanish conqu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores and their &quot; wives &quot; wives . &quot; &quot; therefore , it is not to justify that many girls and boys to move into a system of slavery in which they become light victim for abuse and exploitation . &quot;
the social inequality in Paraguay and that for vision are key to the understanding of the phenomenon known as cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill introduced to Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay is changing by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian MPs recently agreed to a draft law on &quot; regulations regarding the use and utility of social networks . &quot;
&quot; when it is accepted by the Parliament , users and users of social media have to register in Egypt at a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would be set up , which is in order to give citizens a permission to give social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of acceptance of the law , users and users had to register with their right names and personnel numbers to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; will it be dre@@ aming of doing this , so that a punishment of up to six months might be in prison or a bu@@ cket with themselves . &quot;
&quot; the bill that consists of six par@@ ag@@ pun@@ ish and used in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any use that runs through the Internet and used to communicate with others through voice , video , and text . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how the law will be enforced when the draft does not apply , as Egyptian authorities want to impose on how Egyptian authorities do not register for the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ du@@ l Satt@@ ar , parliament@@ arians and promot@@ ers of the legislative situation , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user@@ name and a password to get through the fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocks . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt is planning to judge a fire@@ wall at the national level around Facebook . due to which it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information to their identity , to access the network . &quot;
yet it is not known so far that such plans exist .
experts in the field are scep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; conduc@@ tive research &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I even doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they make it possible that just as they have rap@@ ed physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; when I take them seriously , then this means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who request a permit or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring it to a trial process . &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legislative process and the constitutional committees before it enters the debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement is successful or not , the draft is consistent with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in the parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and it should be assured that no devi@@ ation Nar@@ ration is present on the picture surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ ha@@ wy proposed a pro@@ filing against cy@@ ber crime against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life @-@ long prison sentence intended for those who threaten to threaten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot; &quot;

&quot; this entry by To@@ dd Re@@ ub@@ old has been published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . the contribution is also published as part of a agreement to content sharing . &quot;
high up in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the north @-@ east of Iraq the animal @-@ based H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the ancient Persian leop@@ ards .
&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of leop@@ ards , which strikes through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sa@@ x@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . overall , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are based on the basis of Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of her habitat and since they are getting fewer prey , at risk . &quot;
why is this specific type of leop@@ ards so important ?
&quot; like R@@ aza in the video , the Persian leop@@ ard is the only remaining carni@@ val in the Kurdish ecosystem , and the health and the prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on that a big de@@ ple@@ tier is available . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ards is really low and goes against zero . when the team in the video makes it clear that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera af@@ ers , R@@ aza breaks out in a pure pleasure . &quot;
&quot; as a trained Bi@@ olog@@ in , R@@ aza is passionate about a different side of their country , which exists not only from war and conflict . &quot;
for six years it has been involved in field studies to wild animals and to education programmes of Nature Iraq .
it has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to ensuring that protection zones for wild animals can be established in the Kurdistan region .

&quot; in early March 2017 , documented the daily newspaper Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , made the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those who had been triggered by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a violent earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and a atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered the disaster . &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture was a pre@@ fecture of pre@@ fecture in Japan northeast , which both experienced the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had disappear whole coastal cities from the map . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Fu@@ kus@@ hima the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still experienced a nuclear accident . therefore , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses . &quot;
the special report of Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows the progress made six years later in order to re @-@ establish the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the paper includes both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of those affected themselves .
&quot; apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that as far as December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts ( about , about , , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the biggest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures have recorded Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima forms the final light against Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; however , one always tries to move again six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated from Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ wald ( S@@ ell , Kaz@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) into final spare parts . &quot;
&quot; after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in containers shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 , 36 000 people lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such containers . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of 2011 ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i had more successful than 75 per cent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation that has been hau@@ led after disaster in housing shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is here by 34 per cent . &quot;
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures .
&quot; how the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ newspaper was able to find out , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools who were affected by the disaster , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures are much more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing vessels in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , in Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 percent of the fishing cities have resum@@ ed their operation . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , have drawn large @-@ scale in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agricultural land . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of arable land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent of arable land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of nuclear energy , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed agricultural land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of tourism , tourism has once again recovered , but again Fu@@ kus@@ hima still remains down@@ beat . &quot;
&quot; the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again at 90 percent of the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , however , can only be 75 percent here . &quot;
&quot; however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coast @-@ inhabitants , it &apos;s more difficult to experience their living . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; to determine a full picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys under the local population and under the ev@@ ac@@ uation by the ev@@ ac@@ uation . she asked them about the status of re@@ building and also , as did their recep@@ tor to the ts@@ un@@ ami risk . &quot;
in her introduction of the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper writes :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey in order to find out more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the native population .
&quot; the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 per cent of local residents , measures have taken to be prepared for future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respondents find that still not enough in terms of disaster prevention has been done . &quot;
how it stands for those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ated the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture
&quot; in her issue to the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has strengthened its attention also to the situation of the ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima had not only had to experience the tremendous earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also witness of the worst , disastrous , atomic accident that ever had to experience in Japan . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 a little more than 23 000 people had been converted back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent spare parts . &quot;
&quot; after 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants from Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside their home pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation areas are most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation , which still have to compete in containers shel@@ ters , over 50 years old . they have to compete for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . this is building projects that are part of the Olympic Games that are part of the Olympic Games . &quot;
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people encounter people from other countries , speaking a different language , the differences appear to be greater than the similarities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one often recognizes that one more links than it seems at first glance . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important , as they challenge our prejudices , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this sequence of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat topics that often get less attention in the coverage than they deserve . &quot;
&quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members , who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly inter@@ connected with someone over language and country borders . &quot;
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ ini explains how love for music has consolidated their affection for Iranian culture ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time when she worked with people from around the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week to the intensive care station : last Friday had taken him a police officers during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a stroke against the head . nationwide took millions of prot@@ esters in a protest against savings .
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain @-@ trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated him this Saturday and now have put him into an artificial com@@ a .
its condition is regarded as critical .
the local image Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus that quickly spread in Brazil within a few days .
&quot; in the pictures , the face of the police officers can be recognized that identified with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been known until the completion of the investigation of the incident of the active ministry . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers as he struck in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his drummer on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( Photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
would a police officers test out of a prot@@ esters and land on the intensive care station would be to see his face six months on TV and the whole oppression would be justified .
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared by Lu@@ iz da Luz &apos;s recorded video in the net , where you see , as Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officers , and several san@@ ity shortly afterwards . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also shown in social networks . &quot;
in the clip you see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another federal state , Internet users now donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2.@@ 700 euros ) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , while being in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political force : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ in Irish was murdered by his father , because he has been sab@@ otage the military police force in secondary schools . and now we have settled the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who has been attacked by a poli@@ cem@@ an police , who has struck him with a stroke of poli@@ c@@ emen . &quot;
police officers
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only State in Brazil where there came to brutal police officers on Friday last Friday .
&quot; police officers continued during protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where prot@@ esters had built a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and lac@@ ri@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police via loud@@ speaker to refrain from violence against demonstrators . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media road@@ prot@@ esters have distorted the focus on another , unexpected protagon@@ ists : a window . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported on a crus@@ hing glass windows to outline their title pages with a photo .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a brand on fire . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window t@@ art@@ board than about the protests of thousands who serve the defence of a special thing . &quot;
this must also be recognised when you are strictly opposing any form of damage .
&quot; here also the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; receives an absurd , dis@@ proportionate meaning , and the typical violence of military police are dec@@ eived by headlines with the title &quot; demonstrators on confron@@ t@@ ational confrontation with the police . &quot; &quot;
the un@@ seen villages in Cuba

&quot; the municipality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al I , located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of which there is no appreci@@ able sugar @-@ harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were placed in the sugar mills .
&quot; the su@@ gars in the region stands still , and the factory lost after and after its installations , until only the rum@@ st of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
approximately 2@@ 72 workers had to re@@ invent itself .
some were very rare the work .
&quot; other res@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied and com@@ mu@@ te daily to the factories , which are still gr@@ ace@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an that stands up every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar industry is not rob@@ bed to his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that in the east of the region sugar mills , which are in operation after a long in@@ active time , because they were obtained . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene remembers exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al I would receive the su@@ gars , but the promise has not been kept . &quot;
&quot; the su@@ gar@@ net industry already contradic@@ ted the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ effici@@ encies , the poor administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , the output of 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced quantity . &quot;
&quot; the news would have been a motive for alarm for the country a couple of decades ago , but the bad ones have already no more news . &quot;
why was the Cub@@ an sugar industry turned out ?
the old rail@@ roads of the church saw already better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction in the sugar industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar mills were technically outdated , and hardly competitive they were in@@ toler@@ able for the land . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to focus the production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they only left the factories that can produce sugar for maximum 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the moti@@ fs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar plantations and the su@@ gars in the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the su@@ gars increased from around a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 20@@ 25 the price of un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os will remain per pound , according to 2016 report &quot; &quot; agricultural perspectives &quot; &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations and Food Organisation of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3,@@ 6 million tonnes ) , the crude export of about 85 million dollars would be for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; the day &apos;s day will certainly go down in history , which were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
from that on the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
&quot; in the following years , the lac@@ tation of a total of 98 sugar mills , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training . &quot;
the same happened in the su@@ ro@@ hr@@ factory Greg@@ orio Arl@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al i on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked since 1967 in the factory .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as it is known as a soldier , talking about the closing of the factory , the word he is most repeated , &quot; fraud . &quot; &quot;
almost all those questioned are the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down .
&quot; so that the place will be preserved , it formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first end of the year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially distributed documents , which would be removed only regarding the parts that would be removed , the addres@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could approve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from there on , the responsibility passed over and the letters were getting more and more common . &quot;
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the tac@@ tically factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the su@@ gars . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another facility , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was in favour of his will to the factory of the factory , whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with any part , which he removed , disman@@ tled one of his 31 years of work . &quot;
the best developed industrial area developed by Cuba and the most important job producers has been eradic@@ ated .
&quot; in many cases , no alternatives for the work stations and services have been generated , which generated the plants in the municipalities where they were created . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if the Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech saw from 21 October 2002 , the then president in the eyes of the present persons , when he guaranteed that for the regions whose factories were no longer in operation , everything was going to run smoothly . &quot;

since 2004 the su@@ gar@@ cane is extracted only high by M@@ ole .

&quot; after two years , the municipality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al I learned that many things change , but not always for the better if a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the su@@ gars closed , or better said when they began to cur@@ ate them , they also listened to , the road to asp@@ hal@@ ting , this is disadvantaged also other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced ages , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories . &quot;
they were made to spare parts .
&quot; without future perspectives , many young people also left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production does not even serve for the supply of the church . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant continues to be imposing .
&quot; at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
&quot; Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty For@@ ced the old soldiers an R@@ ent of two thousand Pes@@ o per month , in order to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al . &quot;
&quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , there is no later person , nevertheless , he gives the lies that one told him not . &quot;
they have been tor@@ ment him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene goes in R@@ ent with 65 years of age , not because it lacks strength , but because he is bitter . &quot;

young people from the First Nations communities are dealing with topics that are important to them . they do so by means of Hi@@ p Hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , since 2014 workshop leader Mobile Ton@@ studios take place directly to schools and youth centers , to bring youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video @-@ production and live appearances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were managed by the pedago@@ gues David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North @-@ Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hi@@ p Hop group The North@@ Stars together . &quot;
&quot; the workshop thus increases that the young participants in discussions topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self acceptance &quot; or whatever will always come to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state . &quot;

the cases were largely un@@ explained .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video player to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite influences by globalisation . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people will not always master the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation was taken , the chor@@ us will be sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the young people involved here received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hi@@ p Hop group , which lie@@ der to them a St@@ rop@@ he in the dialect of Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; on the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ side of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the St@@ rop@@ he is available in outlines , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German . &quot;
&quot; sometimes I feel , as if no one would ever be interested in me . &quot;
but I try to go on Earth for my days
&quot; that is the day you will accept our cry , &quot;
because we have lost our way in life as a youth
&quot; but I believe that we will rise up one day , &quot;
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; thus , they can grow and move as much as our youth . &quot;
&quot; thus , they can do that , which they determined the Creator . &quot;

in Japan one can see sp@@ lash dishes almost every restaurant .
&quot; to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , are displayed near the entrance gate ( the one , &quot; &quot; Plas@@ tic models of the dishes &quot; &quot; ) of each food that is served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers see these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
&quot; there is a whole industry , dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes . &quot;
&quot; in the short@@ cut district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a multitude of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes , which was documented by the German film@@ makers W@@ im Wen@@ der in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so usual that they don &apos;t even change them anymore . however , a new trend turns them into con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous cell accessories and other gadgets . &quot;
&quot; at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published series of social media links and photos , which show this unusual twist to the sho@@ ok . &quot;
now in special sale : new with plastic @-@ designed mobile @-@ hing@@ ed on how they are shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu Kauf@@ haus .
&quot; many of these artificial foods were turned to kit@@ sch@@ y ec@@ ast objects , as in this case , cooling cabinet magne@@ ts : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin cooling windows for a new exhibition at Tokyo @-@ Station .
the new boom of the Essen@@ ces is increasingly lav@@ atory .
&quot; in this case , there was a cave @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) turned into a mobile @-@ handed . &quot;
for these tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we have found a good use as a mobile phone .
also this part was produced at the Tokyo Exhibition Centre in Tokyo .
and here is an apple that is holding your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to see as an apple , with a candle for mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is just the beginning of an increasing excursion into the com@@ ic .
&quot; some mobile @-@ phones and mobile designers allow you to manufacture your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon @-@ o@@ estrogen is used , a popular place that is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now I can fix my mobile phone with salmon @-@ o@@ estrogen ? &quot;
I think I will probably be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic might also be a less appe@@ tizing form , to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant . &quot;
our latest mobile @-@ watch has the form of mel@@ ted ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also travel balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and wr@@ y@@ bands from dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; further sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le plastic dishes , you can view yourself at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # , S@@ EC@@ T@@ Y &quot;
&quot; if you would like to know more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the city of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the Bel@@ ie@@ fer@@ ment of the restaurant industry . like for example with the sho@@ oters sandy . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; in Mexico , the suspi@@ cious and gear@@ boxes regularly dive into statistics . however , these reflect not the extent of the human tragedy which this struggle brings . &quot;
&quot; the coverage of drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ cart@@ on , thrust the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , someone looks at the bere@@ av@@ ed or the con@@ gregations who have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; there are behind any glue , behind each bone fund in the hundreds of heated tom@@ bs , the stories paid by parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds might never cure . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico began to learn the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; with the drug trafficking &quot; ) , which is said to give this sacrifice a voice and told stories of people who came into the struggle between law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime can not only be afraid of our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
&quot; for example , when shops close , because they are threatened by drug dealers and so many churches need to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk . &quot;
the pain of victims
a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear life changes &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who is seeking every weekend secret tom@@ bs after his son . &quot;
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost her father to only one day , her four brethren , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew . &quot;
&quot; priest : &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task that we have placed ourselves , go and go to graves , according to the people we loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he was again going back again , but he never came again . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me , for I am now alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , which is here with me . &quot;
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; you are the insurance of my Father &apos;s insurance , but who doesn &apos;t get them out , because a steri@@ lization demand . &quot;
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we do not only show the faces of those who face fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the government . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a les@@ bian of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , the State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that violence should never consider as normal , regardless of what type it occurs : &quot;
I &apos;ve been familiar with disease and Sens@@ ational journ@@ alism for several years now .
I come by newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with pictures that actually only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from experts .
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who has disgu@@ sted or sad . it works , like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body . &quot;
I cannot be in@@ different or consider it to be normal .
she is continuing to write :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 year old c@@ ousin thinks that he is great . and it is also not normal that people will hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the offen@@ ders , if they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me this is , as if they have suffered those who have lost someone , and those who have fear that something happened to them too . &quot;
I see our weakness if stories are going to mere numbers in statistics .
&quot; the in@@ som@@ nia of the people is incredible for me , if the death of six people and the extravag@@ ant can be justified by 43 students in a neighboring village so that they were &quot; &quot; rel@@ äs@@ sig . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to talk that they remain spar@@ ed by such trage@@ dies if they are not stir@@ ring and silent .
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico @-@ Stadt wrote the contribution &quot; four months black@@ mail in the main city district : how a family with threats dropped out . in this , it describes how an armed criminal month was pressed for money from their business until they ended up not only the business , but also their families apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain over it never passes , the trau@@ ma remains , the anxiety will come again high , if you are alone . &quot;
habits have changed , telephone numbers too . &quot;
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the farther we are removed , the better . &quot;
it included her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you do not know when they will dec@@ eived or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself these terrible days if wines would resolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answers is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega released the post &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence signed . &quot;
&quot; in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man , who was murdered by organised crime ? &quot;
what is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mex@@ ic@@ os ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a guard and he tells you to teach himself how to cook a egg , potatoes , tor@@ tillas warm and &apos; Chi@@ chi &apos; for the babies which live with it . this is his name for the preparation of the surface with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
&quot; but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes , un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom all life made of violence and who had to learn to live with it . &quot;
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother disappeared . &quot;
but that was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was past two years before , when he saw only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody body of his father had been shot by the armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence organized by organised crime and fighting against the existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez , Ju@@ á@@ rez , was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of kill@@ ings based on public safety and government of the Government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 , the Public Pro@@ secutor &apos;s Office was 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this is equivalent to 8.@@ 5 Mor@@ den per day . &quot;
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands who organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country .
few stories continue to live in the face of ever new lines . but this project reminds us of those that we are not allowed to forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; , Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico presents its objective to present complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trading , which has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades , in an intel@@ li@@ gible way . &quot;
when a picture is worth a thousand words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flickr users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) warning : this post and pages to which it is linked , include pictures , on which violence is represented . &quot;
the fact check is important in a moment in which it is about to raise a rum@@ or or fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but how is the years after something the first ever emerged ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist . &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
&quot; since its first publication , it was mis@@ leading to describe trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
this false coupling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First D@@ raft News - does not deny the fact that there is much careful coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; however , it raises questions about our desire for pictures on news . &quot;
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank venture carried the village of San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te and explo@@ ded . thereby , 230 people were killed . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war was Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected and thus devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become dangerous paths , which were difficult to drive . &quot;
tra@@ gically he fell victim to the victim of the petrol station .
&quot; officials described a fire ball , the d@@ utz@@ lig@@ ament , including a movie nearby , which was full of people who illustr@@ ating the football world . &quot;
houses for@@ ged and shortened bodies were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the in@@ ven@@ ity .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident , form the gray @-@ sided scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example .
it shows rows of stolen body that are hanging on the ground while individuals are watching them .
but here history does not find its end .
&quot; over the years the same photo was applied several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and mis@@ understand@@ ably linked to the trage@@ dies , particularly events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ erian villages B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically of atrocities that they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and cor@@ pse plants in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; nobody stayed back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said a citizen of Human Rights Watch . &quot;
many were disper@@ sed , shot or burned . &quot;
only on the basis of satellite images could be presented the follow @-@ up time .
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ explained , but the army base in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt at the B@@ oko Har@@ am , to gain land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the picture from the DR Congo again proved to be evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a mass@@ acres of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris . &quot;
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ err@@ atic use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of failures ; Africa check has documented orders to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
in all of these cases the picture was taken as a test@@ ament to mass destruction .
&quot; even one step further bring personal comments as this example mis@@ led the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments . &quot;
the picture of San@@ ge came in Myanmar with the fatal persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a lightning report , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported on violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared like the following on which these descriptions brought together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture was derived from an aci@@ di @-@ Arab news page , the President of mar@@ s Th@@ an Being had said , monks and politicians had participated in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from the DR Congo to pictures this information . &quot;
&quot; the original fee , on which last on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organisations , which called AF@@ P as their source , had also mistak@@ enly called Th@@ ein Being of this statement , but had not been linked to the picture from the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false coupling cuts back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; using a &quot; &quot; reverse picture search &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot;
&quot; a revers@@ ed picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found at 18.@@ 8 billion images ( status of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 images , which the said image of the DR Congo are very similar . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixing space private pages , platforms of social media and Community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
some have passed wrong reports and have tried other attempts to dis@@ miss counterf@@ eit@@ s .
&quot; we have limited examples of the use of abuse and associated with the respective countries , based on which page they have been published . thus , we want to represent the range of more visible than through the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which in some cases have also been associated with each other ) , several examples of mis@@ used use may come from . &quot;
here are some cases that can now be fully played ( on the map in orange ) :
map : news Fr@@ ames .
examples of false cou@@ pl@@ ings of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
&quot; the orange spots are wise on pages or servers , over the examples of counterf@@ eit@@ s or fal@@ cons still available . &quot;
&quot; the countries in Gray are examples , which are available according to the met@@ adata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also fraud @-@ examples . &quot;

&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme example of an ab@@ used use of the picture from the DR Congo , on the one hand , expresses sympathy towards the Nig@@ erian massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the asser@@ tions that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are per@@ secuted , since the photos were mis@@ used . &quot;
Myanmar with 2017 .
&quot; the Myanmar government released a col@@ lateral position on what they referred to as &quot; inten@@ tionally fin@@ alised news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create confusion about Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; these reefs , which appeared exclusively in English , also contains references to counterf@@ eit pictures of rum@@ ch@@ ism , the H@@ ate Spe@@ ech operate and used by extrem@@ ist groups to outline that Muslims kill Buddh@@ ists and inv@@ isi@@ ve ( which is often distributed by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;

&quot; this post , which directed itself to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly shows that the picture of the DR Congo does not show Muslims that Christians kill . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this news page has asser@@ ted that the president of Myanmar Th@@ ein has been given in 2012 , that monks and politicians had been involved in the kill@@ ings of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought together the story with the image of the San@@ ge . &quot;
&quot; the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication , the picture continues to be included . &quot;
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 about students who were killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic Church An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the picture is not derived from the kill@@ ings but it claims that it has a &quot; similar d@@ otes attack &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in connection with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , in connection with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , the newspaper El Pa@@ is was trying to resist that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ ci@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ yu@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world sleeps ) . &quot;
&quot; the picture of the DR Congo , fitted with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and sol@@ dering a discussion among Muslims , following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , 2015 and the proposal to Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities found these events , the mut@@ ated in the name of Islam , a greater attention . &quot;
&quot; USA , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was used as a test@@ ament to the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 Male ret@@ we@@ et@@ et ) , but the messages that were associated with it were found in no religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the goal was to draw attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media reporting relevant to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) in 2014 .
&quot; after a message that allegedly written by a &quot; &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; written about the Nig@@ erian massacre was in circulation , there were a discussion discussion like this here on Vietnamese and declared it to be false . &quot;
&quot; from the message which the picture from the DR Congo was included , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of a faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; for other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the cap in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye can also be found , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / file stamp exist on the web@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and unified they have picture names related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all of these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original un@@ runner from 2010 , the picture finally carries a correct description , but the original fee is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
&quot; there are two strong topics or frames ( fr@@ aming of frames ) , which draw on these po@@ sts . the first fr@@ ame focused on religion . &quot;
the photo was used in terms of greater discussions about the silence in relation to the mur@@ ders of Christians through Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the murder of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Buddh@@ ists .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how a African life is evaluated in comparison to a European or French life .
&quot; religion is to be understood and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth to examine how pictures can be used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; a deeper question is , however , what happens when readers can no longer believe this pictures . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are tens of people who have un@@ intended to exercise the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggest that mood of mis@@ - and false information that actual atrocities are un@@ true and decorate it the real atro@@ city of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of rap@@ ids have already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
&quot; an argument is that the rejection of images of a ref@@ usal , however , comes to recognise the tragedy . sometimes these images are even asked by the victims . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that non@@ violent images readers and viewers are des@@ ensi@@ tizing and give them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , the examination , such as violent media to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there are some things to discuss about rap@@ ids in the news media , fact is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . &quot; you will be thoroughly thinking about the situation in which a picture suggests something that is actually used , but also ab@@ used from the context or to completely ab@@ err@@ atic nature . &quot;
&quot; however , any investigation of false grants should also be taken into account as internationally as they can be . &quot;

the &quot; In@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqueness of smaller languages
photo of Andy Sim@@ mons uses according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. D@@ t. uns@@ plac@@ eable ) tries to provide language enth@@ used a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words are available in any language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these uns@@ ur@@ able words are already well known ( such as the famous Portuguese su@@ ck ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all contradic@@ ted any attempt to make a simple translation .
&quot; a word or an expression is not sufficient , which is why a full declaration and sometimes something context are required to accurately understand what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for quite a time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and Lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird was decided to concentrate on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the M@@ w@@ ot@@ ite language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , like : &quot;
v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k - Bem@@ ü@@ h you for your parents in recognition of how to have tried for you in your younger years .
&quot; and words in the H@@ uns@@ creen language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after having been dar@@ ed on cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog About :
&quot; they resol@@ ves other cultures , revealing other thoughts and wake up our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page still want to show more of this &quot; uns@@ ur@@ able &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; which are highly appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite farms here .

how Sri Lanka is working with the worst Fl@@ ut@@ ein@@ disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently undergoing the worst flood of water and earth disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon that usually ends at the end of May are characterized by strong rainf@@ alls the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country over the banks . &quot;
&quot; after an opinion of the disaster by Sri Lanka of the 28th of May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missed due to the floods and Schl@@ amm@@ ers . &quot;
over 400 000 people have been affected by the last Friday ( 26 May ) and around 100 000 people were brought to 30@@ 4 safe stay .
&quot; the rains left on Saturday ( 27th May ) , and the waters were slowly coming back in some areas . &quot;
health and hygiene practices represent a massive challenge in the affected areas and still un@@ reachable areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the fleet disaster :
floods in Ta@@ j@@ ama city with water states of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of disaster .

the Air Force has provided five planes for rescue operations and another five are made for the transport of emergency supplies for the residents included in their flooded villages .
various organizations and star@@ tu@@ ps have also declared to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ ente in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood @-@ water supply and humanitarian aid .

&quot; the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum is informed . &quot;
&quot; last year after the disaster of the Tro@@ phy Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me led a &quot; &quot; flood relief &quot; &quot; button which allowed it to call users to call a vehicle for pick@@ up assistance and donations . these were then passed on free to the main Red Cross . &quot;
&quot; as well , they introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button that resulted in more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat trip campaigns for floo@@ ding and land@@ slide people . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kan , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , they bring residents in need , security and help support help . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of other lives , whereby the population of Sri Lan@@ kan is now a long way to restoring norm@@ ality . &quot;
Muslims that cannot be seen
the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ ha@@ zi .
&quot; when approved in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; I trust her four year old daughter , she trusted me her children ; she is my rock in the br@@ anding . &quot;
in the one minute we call up slo@@ gans for the rights of women .
in the next sk@@ ating we urge rights for trans@@ gender .
&quot; we are located in a sea of Um@@ br@@ ellas and humans , some keep the iconic image of a woman with s@@ acks high , bound by an American flag , others sk@@ ating slo@@ gans against Islam@@ ophobia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; these things do not concern yourself , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Mus@@ lim@@ a ? &quot; , &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - of the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has established itself in their imagination . &quot;
you de@@ colon@@ ise me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different species . but somehow we all will be put into the same Muslim dra@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; this dra@@ wer is so well designed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , which as I do not fit it out there . &quot;
will be mobili@@ zed
I do not stand alone .
this is even done to the poet whose poetry in America is best sold : Rum@@ i .
which images come to a sense when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when J@@ al@@ alu@@ dd@@ in Rum@@ i was as old as I am now it was a Orthodox pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
&quot; Islam , the Koran and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western performance the religion was removed , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists of the redu@@ ci@@ onal images of Muslims that have been colonial books for centuries .
&quot; this casual image language is determined by the dark man , whom you should fear and the exotic lady you should save . &quot;
the groundbreaking Palestinian @-@ American scientists Edward S@@ aid de@@ formed the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these images also prot@@ rude today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continued to keep them away . &quot;
&quot; I worked for three years in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty Nar@@ r@@ atives dominate our news@@ fe@@ eds . &quot;
this Nar@@ r@@ v overs@@ ha@@ do@@ wed the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries to elect their first female presidential election .
&quot; this Nar@@ r@@ v fails to acknowledge that if French , Muslim women are prevented from taking their head@@ s@@ ling in public buildings and to cover sour , Muslim women by their government to cover all the body that are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group exercises his &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this strong &quot; &quot; Nar@@ r@@ v &quot; &quot; Muslim women , the movements for change lead . &quot;
&quot; it seems that the first Muslim prayers have been talked to American soil of Afri@@ kan@@ ers , who had been brought here with slave ships . &quot;
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
&quot; this Nar@@ r@@ v has occupied our collective imagination , so deep and faul@@ ty that often Si@@ kh men and children become the aim of tim@@ us@@ li@@ fic attacks and ra@@ ils . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories we tell and due to the way we tell them , Islam@@ ophobia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
among the 1.7 billion
in the news industry we are doing more than just telling stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create fo@@ ols who help us understand the world .
and my industry failed to capture the Nar@@ r@@ v of 1.7 billion .
and we have failed here where seven million Muslims be at the highest degree &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America .
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ African Americans .
&quot; six out of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation , which come from 77 countries . &quot;

four decades ago my native parents came to live in New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother put her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the skyscrapers of New York ; skyscrapers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time when Khan was newly discovered the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were inevitable , Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I supposed to kill Mus@@ lim@@ a and Americ@@ an@@ erin ?
&quot; sometimes , if people ask me why I don &apos;t eat por@@ k , I say - instead of taking my Muslim recipes or record my hand@@ some pocket that all Muslims carry in themselves - &quot; &quot; respect for Pep@@ pa@@ h W@@ utz &quot; . &quot; &quot;
I jo@@ kes that we do not bear every pocket pairs with us .
we also need to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to become almost always selected for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter @-@ religious activists who make an effort to fight widespread lies across Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the current volume of a well @-@ used Islam@@ ist machine with cash , Thin@@ k tanks and experts for counterf@@ eit information that our already faul@@ ty image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and due to the kind in which we tell them , the hos@@ tility exists in more than just a stranger , that of a woman sh@@ ro@@ ud the head . &quot;
&quot; or as the start@@ ling map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole USA , see below . &quot;

I want to explain that .
&quot; I was born as Mus@@ lim@@ a , but a Mus@@ lim@@ a was born then in my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ i@@ anic church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientist describe religious life , they attack the following terms : faith , behaviour and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my muscular faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neighbor , my rock in the Brand@@ ung see that I am Mus@@ lim@@ a , when they could look through the 15 meters concrete and air , that our houses separate . &quot;
she would see the all@@ ab@@ end@@ ous ritual with my daughter when I dwell in my arms and her Arab verses to protect the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each one of them repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that she is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my mus@@ li@@ ous faith is possibly not always visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow . &quot;

approved use .
belonging to my Grand@@ mother &apos;s mother with her sisters ; how was a competition of the art of flower arran@@ ger in Kar@@ achi decades ago .
&quot; it is the picture of her that I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by its finished and unfinished paintings painted in Su@@ fi , and a Kor@@ ans with many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and fourteen chapters that can almost be mem@@ orized . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ lim@@ a means being to speak the prayers they had said to me , if I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ lim@@ a is to be as she taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that has been de@@ colon@@ ised by centuries - by an &quot; Empire &quot; which has established a company with the name of Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tic Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Comp@@ an@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord . &quot;
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
approved use .
&quot; belonging means to grow and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time seeing that my native grandfather cri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; while he writes books on modern Islam and the independence of Kas@@ h@@ mir@@ s , crying N@@ ana J@@ aan , and wept N@@ ana J@@ aan , family who did not close his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , apart from coloni@@ alists , who have been diver@@ ted the Muslim world as at the game risk . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ lim@@ a to be meant to know that in the last two centuries , Europeans are all up to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means knowing that the first fli@@ pper of history has been ej@@ ected over a century over a Muslim country .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my Grand@@ mother , an Indones@@ ian under@@ tan of the British empire , was described by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous , &quot; as he introduced the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; before there were planes he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was , preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; to my Muslim tribe of the 1,7 billion people go deep into our unforgettable pedi@@ gre@@ ess , our un@@ plug@@ ging story . &quot;
&quot; it means remind you that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops , spread over every continent apart from the Antar@@ c@@ tica , have gone into Iraq in order to chase weapons of mass destruction that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried among the mu@@ til@@ ers of the war .
to be an American Mus@@ lim@@ a means knowing that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ate has risen since 2001 by more than 32 percent .
it means knowing that when a tragedy comes home to the US and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name carries out the story four times more than a story with a white attack .
&quot; it means knowing that four ten hundred years ago , the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liberated black slaves with the name Bil@@ al . &quot;
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar called tri@@ ali Muhammad ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought into this country .
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X to name a American hero .
it is the warmth I feel when people filled the airports to fight against the Muslim B@@ an .
&quot; it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams , and when we say black life . &quot;
&quot; to be an Americ@@ an@@ erin , a K@@ asch@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Mus@@ lim@@ a and a journalist , the in@@ dur@@ ated inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our with multiple binary identi@@ ties , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ r@@ v of 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a magic cub@@ es , but is represented in the reduced doubt &quot; we &quot; against it . &quot;
&quot; to be a mother means to care about my child and to create all Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that powerful and privileged persons on this bi@@ ased structural Islam@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ ism consists of Muslim registr@@ ations , who began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama . &quot;
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it exists in the immigration officer , who takes up a five year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders towards people from just the countries that bom@@ bed it .
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; No @-@ Fly list , &quot; which largely Arabs and Muslims ins . &quot;
these are the wars that we lead and the bombs we throw in Muslim countries .
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those who we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study with the title A@@ scent of Man , scientists of North@@ western University participants showed a scientific un@@ real image and would judge them , groups on a scale of 1 to 100 on the evolution . &quot;
Muslims got the sligh@@ test score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations we have to lead
&quot; we are too deep dar@@ ing to dis@@ miss the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we stand for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous image prints , which we ver@@ de in our news actions . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which attempts to understand our often with bin@@ ed identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; Pod@@ cast lake something , S@@ ay something from Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ a Muslim ; the viral vide@@ os@@ erie Secret lives of the Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , more Muslim authors , and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ ani , muscular , American super hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot;
screen@@ shots of media initi@@ ates who want to show the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of American life .
col@@ lage of the author .
&quot; but I am worried due to this difficult global time@@ point , in which we are located . &quot;
and that moment has consequences that go beyond the 1,7 billion .
&quot; there is one reason for the conspir@@ atorial theore@@ ti@@ cians , which existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now the White House . &quot;
they have grown expon@@ entially because they have made Muslims into &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ entially , by creating the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
she had not been given a couple of years before ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
&quot; I am worried about the realities and the history of which I was not aware of as I was old now , as now my daughter is , but which made me today to be un@@ miss@@ able Mus@@ lim@@ a . &quot;
things that I left here like a Br@@ ot@@ claw in my speech .
&quot; things that might ar@@ ouse memories , as in all the inter@@ sec@@ tions that constitutes our humanity , like a story , where someone is made to another . &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversation in the context of the 8th annual conference on Islamic hos@@ tility instead . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred academics talk about our problems with the &quot; &quot; other &quot; , &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
but these are no terms with which we usually throw in our schools or let us read in our newspapers .

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where yet Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are led and people going through the work of &quot; others &quot; in the public presentation , four decades even scientists . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves un@@ convenient questions after the role of it , consciously and consciously to solidi@@ fy the &quot; others &quot; because the employment we have had a new future , in which we have no president , the chocolate cake spe@@ edi@@ ly , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it begins here with all of us .
the initiative for narr@@ atives wants to preserve urban diversity
stor@@ yt@@ ellers of Flickr @-@ user Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now in spite of a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) the proceeds of stories in their original language is a possible response to it . &quot;
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird , the Un@@ sur@@ able blog . &quot;
&quot; here however , the focus of T@@ LS is not written on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of big cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already performed events for 2015 , the risk of small and non @-@ such small languages are not passed on to children . &quot;
for the creators of the project is valid :
&quot; the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities , diversity of diversity - secure spaces where inhabitants do not have to be forgotten who they are to include . &quot;
&quot; while &quot; &quot; listen often associated with it , &quot; &quot; to understand these events instead &quot; listening to value , to feel to feel . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers represent their story first in their own language and translate or explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their dedication and representation lead to it that the list@@ eners to it . &quot;
they call laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows for example a traditional story of Burkina Faso , who is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate is also the opportunity to explain the country &apos;s typical customs stor@@ ks for their country . &quot;
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara told the f@@ uss of the rab@@ bits and P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; after having explained the importance of his f@@ le@@ bel , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is that to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide smile , he shares his sense of inclu@@ siveness : &quot;
you have heard !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling has taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS in order to organize their own story t@@ ellers . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls from the US re@@ establishment of the sovereign debt
&quot; the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , who participated in 72 million US dollars , participated in 72 million US dollars on the last 3 April 2017 ; the march started at the pu@@ zz@@ ing Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and ran to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the Old Town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
she was called by the group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( front front for the ne@@ ural examination of debts ) and of the Ö@@ Com@@ en@@ ian Church Meeting in Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the advocate of the re @-@ determination of debts also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos calls for the politicians , ban@@ kers and government agencies , who are responsible for debts , for their corrupt responsibilities . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial review and a guidance committee without personal interests in public debt , with fixed , our working conditions appropriate remuner@@ ation , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot;
we will be pressed and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos refuse to pay a debt that is not their .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be found with declining pension payments .
we demand immediate measures .
&quot; the island - not in the states of the integrated territory of the USA , suffering from a serious financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; that is why the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a pro @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization without party membership , with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law for state responsibility before , as an alternative to the existing state view . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis in Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; on the outside , measures imposed without the participation and conviction of citizens are risk to be rejected by the people . &quot;
the demonstration carried the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; the book that was released last year and is released here Licens@@ ing is available , contains a number of attempts that deal with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
&quot; this book wants to discuss how movements are set up for free knowledge , and what the real costs are associated with . &quot;
&quot; activists , artist , designers , developers , researchers , researchers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have been working on page to see above the fog that surrounds our news@@ springs and to create some sense from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated internet volunteers , who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was painted out of the directory of the A@@ dra @-@ prison , in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or location . &quot;
&quot; the leading part of his book with the title of collective remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release , and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom . &quot;
&quot; seeing how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us are beginning to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we now here ?
what did we choose ?
what have we abandoned in this process of times extreme convic@@ tions ?
the Web@@ Develop@@ ers for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in prison by Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment to an un@@ familiar place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer of N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , told that the &quot; military police base &quot; recorded on the basis of a &quot; &quot; secret &quot; &quot; command of the Military Court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she was contacted by people on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as the in@@ sider of the Assad regime and put knowledge of an alleged death part against their husband . &quot;
its place of residence and condition remain unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role to expand access to the internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Techn@@ ologist and currently over the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project , founded the Bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps no one of Bas@@ sels &apos;s cultural prototype was predic@@ tive than the work that he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins Pal@@ my@@ ras virtual .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites of the world , was the im@@ cross of numerous civilizations and here merge Greek @-@ Roman architecture @-@ types with local traditions and per@@ severe influences . &quot;
&quot; Bas@@ sel could not know then that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put it all about it , this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens , but of the world . &quot;
&quot; this Strei@@ fung into the digital archae@@ ology and the conservation has created a time @-@ chapel , which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of invaluable importance . &quot;
&quot; sorry , Bas@@ sel has not yet been able to complete this project yet . &quot;
&quot; N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I spent my entire life with it , of freedom to dream and ba@@ z@@ sel taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhelmed when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English even when he was in custody .
I learned to read and speak English well .
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with each person who has asked . he has taught other instructions , to write and speak English . &quot;
Bas@@ sel opened the door to technology . he taught me to use both computers and smart phones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he has also taught other prisoners , as they may use computers , at least theoretically , without that they actually stopped one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a sab@@ otage which she wrote in the years 2012 till 2015 her husband when he was in custody . &quot;
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura have worked together on the book for a long time .
they sent the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated her from Arabic to English .
the book is license @-@ free .
book envelope of Youssef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening &quot; :
it is done with every visit ;
&quot; that I have vers@@ ed in the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that any of the dangers not matter , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ackl@@ es and watch@@ men &quot;
I forget the cr@@ ush of the prison
&quot; and in every detail of your voice and words , &quot;
who I am with passion for me
when your eyes say goodbye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I quickly returns to my lon@@ eliness , &quot;
to get all the moments back
and about your absence to we@@ ep and smile .
I over@@ see myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bas@@ sel wrote G@@ ha@@ zi :
&quot; a year passed , my soul &quot;
while in
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ sels History is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the regime Bashar al @-@ Assad , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian network for human rights ) disappeared more than 6@@ 5,000 people . &quot;
&quot; those who were arrested , were tor@@ tured or executed by violence by the regime , were tor@@ tured , or even executed . &quot;
until 2016 the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in prison since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community calls for 2012 the release of Bas@@ sel .
&quot; today , we reiter@@ ate our call in hope that we have to do this for the last time . &quot;
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : due to corruption condemned Director after port release again on previous posts
&quot; Moz@@ ambi@@ kaner re@@ acted with anger on a corruption accident , in which a government member returned after half of his sentence to the workplace at the state apparatus , where the corruption has been committed . &quot;
&quot; this is di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment with four other def@@ endants due to the im@@ par@@ ation of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( approximately 800 000 Euros ) . &quot;
&quot; the money was made from public funds of the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , whose Council Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 due to good leadership and requested immediately his re @-@ setting into the company , which happened on 19 April then also . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with an opinion of the general public @-@ country relationship of the Republic , which claimed the request , there would be no obstacles to Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume its old post as the company was not a discipl@@ ining process after his detention . &quot;
&quot; however , many people don &apos;t know the action well . &quot;
&quot; the Center for Public Health ( Centro de Inte@@ gri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ blica , shortly C@@ IP ) , is a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned in an interview with the German wave , the decision of the company to re @-@ establish the director : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; puts a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a set@@ back in regard to the efforts of our legal system , so that C@@ IP . &quot;
what we take note is that also the company should have a discipl@@ in@@ arity against the fe@@ asi@@ tism .
&quot; however , the firm apparently seemed to be a reasonable legal steps for the application of the appropriate functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ an social media , re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; ref@@ uted &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent type , he would be advis@@ er after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and left half of it . &quot;
&quot; he could hold lectures and motiv@@ ational speeches , he might be advised and his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has refused to become re@@ integrated into the company that he helped to cause damage . &quot;
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za will be paid for his silence .
contradictory !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambi@@ an and student of political sciences in Brazil , the director had no morality whatsoever : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state , because he did not believe it , that someone was rewarded with someone in such a way that the state has already massi@@ vely increased . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks morality and serve the state , * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead of serving themselves only at the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state , as hand@@ some it became an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself has become tired of being diagnosed and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I do not know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te preferred to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remind you that a th@@ ief belongs to the prison : &quot;
&quot; Die@@ be &apos;s prison in the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el is not only to be remembered as a first independent president , but also as a scar@@ ring , dig@@ ging and - next door - prophe@@ tic speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most prominent oral representations was , when he reaffir@@ med vigor@@ ously that &quot; an ambitious man is too capable of , even the father@@ land for his ambitions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora said : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person has changed , my experience shows that he is not so . he changes the tactic , but he does not turn off his ambitions . &quot;
a ambitious man is at the same time criminal . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also down@@ right : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he spent ten years and came free . &quot;
&quot; and today it sets the company , with which he is de@@ filed , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ yed mat@@ ures ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017 &quot;
E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo from the magazine @ Ver@@ da@@ de ( to dt . : @ Truth ) notes that crime in Moz@@ ambi@@ que pays off :

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; means Ki@@ ck@@ her@@ edi@@ ts or Sp@@ age .
photo of San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Commons , Creative Commons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net , because they reveal the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East @-@ Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective . &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or the &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or the way of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements has given the word an extremely remote con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar &apos;@@ may be associated with racism today , but the word itself does not automatically arise from hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; many people have reported that po@@ sts , in which they have reviewed the use of the word or have doubts about his use . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , there are several bur@@ mes@@ ian words with fundamental meanings , which have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ically also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ age ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
&quot; the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ at My@@ at declared the different meanings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , saying , &quot;
a post by one of my friends was deleted today because it contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends on a spiritual way whether they knew how he could allevi@@ ate his back pain by doing a word . &quot;
&quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; &quot; healing &quot; &quot; ( la ) + the Fra@@ ge@@ word ( la ) at Bur@@ mes@@ an - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; in Win , the opinion that it will reduce hate @-@ speaking national nation@@ alists , however , stressed that Facebook must be analy@@ tic before reaching all po@@ ds that are in suspicion , racism . &quot;
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on fac@@ be@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to analyse the post carefully and control it by checking the following words .
&quot; for example , &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; &quot; ( age @-@ age ) . &quot;
&quot; the good is that this dre@@ ck@@ ery nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , a pretty good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nationalism .
&quot; while the action likes to send a strong signal to anyone who spread hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the word word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his Po@@ sts as he only wanted to inform his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ban@@ ished from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I was attentive to this new directive of Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to inform Li@@ ken , post and sharing of content for 24 hours because of the post &quot; Facebook Community standards . &quot; &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of po@@ sts of people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against hate @-@ speaking nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed which has nothing to do with hate speech :
mail without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
&quot; Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook would have more to do before the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work . &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; moreover , it appears as if they started without local context or technical support and have banned words like &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; inheritance curr@@ y &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the adulter@@ ated po@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million people , they would like to produce big revenues , that would be great . &quot;
Fac@@ ebooks automated cens@@ orship provided for a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users are now using Facebook funny and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech , to see if their po@@ sts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook Po@@ sts , who have no hate speech , but nevertheless removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ical text is &apos; I want to sit on a chair and see inheritance curr@@ y and watch an Indian film .
&quot; only to try out whether Facebook contains the post , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
scre@@ enshot with permission .
&quot; stating &quot; If you are a doctor , you then heal people ? &quot;
scre@@ enshot with permission .
&quot; in the last five years there are extreme nationalist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists , which have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks is to mar@@ vel the violence in the municipalities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Buddh@@ ists have forced thousands to escape . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was critic@@ ised for his failure , who are talking out of hate speech on his bur@@ mes@@ ian sides under control . &quot;
&quot; but instead of using the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have better to look at the context than on the code of focus initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is at the end with the children &apos;s deer
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 . &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is now illeg@@ ally illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament adopted unanim@@ ously decided on June 9 , 2017 , which should prohi@@ bit this practice , so that the actual age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; before this change in the sp@@ ar law , a few members insisted on the practice and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the inter @-@ religious organisation ( IR@@ O ) , a group , the representatives of the various religious groups of the country together , that the state did not interfere , as this , age did not determine the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN &apos;s rights Convention , the min@@ ors , and every human being under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were married with 15 were in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago 2,@@ 8 percent , and with 18 were 8,@@ 1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the official office of the country confirmed that 1997 @-@ 2007 was more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys aged under 19 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements that were eager to withdraw laws to the children &apos;s before , followed at the foot and pleasing their great support . without doubt they helped bring about this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hin@@ du @-@ guide , for example , had no concerns about the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should be condemned to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition led to tensions in this really complicated matter , and at some point , there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the bill at all . &quot;
&quot; but early in 2017 , the bill was decided against the children &apos;s before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who was dis@@ missed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him to the law . &quot;
&quot; now , only the president of the country must agree and announce the law . &quot;
&quot; one of the Sen@@ ators of the country gave on Facebook a Status @-@ update , which was again posted in Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agram : &quot;
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill &apos;s design against the children &apos;s before was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and nobody else decided against it .
&quot; having decided before in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of the social media user was thrilled because the laws were finally changed to the children &apos;s before .
&quot; Facebook @-@ member Lo@@ vell Francis , who was a secretary of the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has too much time and unnecessary talk that has disgu@@ ised the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now , and that is worth almost every price . &quot;
&quot; while A@@ bel Jackson of the opinion was , it was definitely long enough to lay down the practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ e @-@ Thomas over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , , Excellent news ! &quot;
the secret law has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ der Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group , which spoke quite openly about it , how important the adoption of the law was noted , noted : &quot;
the actual age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now is independent of the religious group in 18 years .
&quot; the draft to change the sp@@ ar law was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
at the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 members and of this 35 members were present at the vote .
&quot; all MEPs who were opposed , have voted for the law . &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is not allowed by law in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it has been a long fight ( ... ) # 20 Min@@ age@@ - Car@@ din@@ ers .
many thanks to all activists who have drawn him out .
congratulations .
a thanks to our MEPs .
&quot; a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj therefore , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du @-@ organisation of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aj has proclaimed his intention to undertake judicial steps , the law should be adopted and he seems to redeem his promise . &quot;
&quot; during the general public pro@@ secutor Paris Al ra@@ wi , a suppor@@ ter of the law , said it was entirely legitimate when Mahar@@ aj decides to proceed against the law , the most social media users would be able to address the debate differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
&quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of keeping the discussion so generally , in a way that the state , our daughters , that they may be of great , hard @-@ led men who are responsible for them , would you then be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you believe it is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether it does not come to a judicial procedure against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children &apos;s before in different gra@@ dations are legal or still the norm , even though there are laws which they say . &quot;

by the mir@@ rors of web pages Turkish users can see again Wikipedia @-@ contents
&quot; the English @-@ speaking Wikipedia @-@ page was presented on 18 January 2012 , contradictory to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the US , internationally dark@@ ened . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for over a month , Turkey has now seen the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle @-@ based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia . &quot;
&quot; day after day , more clearly how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information . &quot;
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series are against the sper@@ mat@@ ozo@@ a .
&quot; although many techniques of technology used it is used to use modification tools for block websites ( a current article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third @-@ largest VPN prevalence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been published in Wikipedia by Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University has been staged since 2007 , after the Internet Law ( No. 5@@ 6@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; according to China , Turkey is the most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform continues to be locked , there are several mir@@ r@@ or@@ sides ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) . &quot;
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) when the platform generated all Turkish Wikipedia @-@ to @-@ pe@@ de@@ centralized Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer network ( i.e. machine calcul@@ ator ) which does not base itself on the system of dom@@ a@@ inn@@ ate and thus making a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is available in spite of the legal prohibition .
in a blog post IP@@ FS tells about his efforts :
&quot; after we have heard the news ( on the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything in it , sn@@ apshots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the contents on de@@ centralized and distributed manner . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia contents , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and just about screen@@ shots and no Live@@ - or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to avoid the sperm . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a Mir@@ r@@ or@@ side of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project , that everyone can use to host similar Mir@@ r@@ or@@ pages when in the respective country of Wikipedia . &quot;

&quot; there is no complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror . &quot;
one attack another URL which is not the original . that which one sees then is from Wikipedia .
&quot; in essence , the server re@@ direc@@ ts the request to the correct Wikipedia site so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia ourselves then when they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .

&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos , which he looked around around , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with bad positioned motives and sp@@ las@@ hing colors . &quot;
the motivated him self @-@ motivated himself to carry and try to understand the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 years , Sag@@ ar tries to move to the international scene at the age of 28 . &quot;
&quot; his home town right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot pictures that direct attention to Nep@@ as wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this excellent position helps with his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world @-@ natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wild photographers ! ! &quot;
&quot; I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) , he had received a call from my father that would be a leop@@ ard on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river . &quot;
the river dam is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
&quot; immediately , I started off with my camera and was there in a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the leop@@ ard was found , and I immediately began to kne@@ ad pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar strives to cooperate with the authorities in order to acquire global recognition for Nepal as nature and would like to deepen understanding that wild animals are not as horri@@ fic as they look .
&quot; and he should know him , because he stood by tigers already from face to face : &quot;
a tiger can not distur@@ b from the opinion of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; I was also home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ zz@@ ks appeared . he immediately starts to see us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar does the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
but his passion for the promotion of Nepal is not always easy .
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and usually lived in a tent in order to make pictures of the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days , until he took a tiger photograph and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , which live near the tourist arrivals . &quot;
check out some of these photos below .

&quot; this entry was posted by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az an@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on video Volun@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing system .
&quot; in many parts of India , women avoid with the greatest care to speak the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women too much to respect her husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences they should dis@@ respect the norm to live this practice alive . &quot;
&quot; last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned from the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a by a sh@@ attered , and rejected by her family and the village community after she addressed a married relatives . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives also do not name their wives , is also prevalent among men . however , they have much less personal instructions to fear , if at all , they should not come to this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra district , nine women , among them health professionals , as well as house@@ wives , a unique club , and were thus quickly becoming the main round table theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; one of 56 clubs that exists in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , who is operated by the community of Video Volun@@ te@@ ers and is committed to the dismantling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; since seven years it has been working with the help of her vide@@ ok@@ am@@ era to un@@ covering practices , such as children &apos;s home to the exile of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS inhibit@@ ors , and manages this clubs . &quot;
it reports on how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and they simultaneously have made it to amb@@ ass@@ adors of change .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini was in its discussion , acted by women who did not name their hus@@ bands . &quot;
she chose this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which the women can easily identify .
&quot; to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands , a Br@@ other is not guilty to all of its sponsors , and have never questioned it . &quot;
Roh@@ ini writes :
this tradition testi@@ fied that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not hold this , is seen as a pen@@ cil , as a woman without mor@@ als . &quot;
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never done thought to this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband on behalf of so far , try to try out at home as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion on her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband sha@@ ved for a long time after the video was finished .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should call him from now on at his name . &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage of Roh@@ ini started its first discussion board .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to move the discussion with a practice . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; If we cannot say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can name us as they want , means that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which they brought the name of their hus@@ bands to the lips , &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ine in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra over the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which women married the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that she had only ki@@ cked off during the whole exercise ; another chose to let all the bot@@ her@@ ing frustration against him and his family by killing him .
the expression on their faces was ek@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; even in adren@@ alin rush about it , with an ancient Br@@ ush broken , the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to name their hus@@ bands . &quot;
and they held their word .
in the next few days it received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put on women in the head : his wife could not stop his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the entire family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she moved , she got afraid and said that it was an error . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in was less understanding and the situation ar@@ ised in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the cin@@ oma point on the forehead , which indicates the E@@ h@@ est@@ atus : &quot;
why must only women show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would carry out the cin@@ oma red point if he was doing it too . &quot;
he lau@@ ghed only and I listened to him to bear him .
&quot; the other women have not stopped fully with it , but they think they are now in a better position to choose himself , not to wear it in some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are making a trip at each discussion . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want the women to worry about who could hear , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
during the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and gentle and spoke about things about which they never had thought of .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have made some things , for example , like our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands , never said honestly . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say certain things loud , no matter how small they happen . &quot;
in a discussion discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have only worn Sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most it is okay , but some wanted a sage @-@ spa , a wide shirt of a pants , wear ; they have not dar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; after much argument and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes , morality joined together with the Sar@@ is and much more , jewellery Roh@@ ini her own couple Kur@@ ta ( Ober@@ hem@@ med ) into a discussion , so that the women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is certain that they will create it . &quot;
&quot; the question arises whether in the five months since their first discussion , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly coming into roles : &quot;
we have only made small steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then listened again to the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , make it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved . &quot;
&quot; just one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands . only one or two women are now wearing Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot , at any time . &quot;
&quot; the women in the discussion , know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the polish for more freedom of movement or their own gar@@ ment - at the end of a difficult to navig@@ ating river . &quot;
&quot; by giving up mutual confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
every one of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman in the club is home and other people reported what we talk and what we do .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia which probably was recently made .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the de@@ tain@@ ted Chinese dis@@ sident , Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer in late June had been announced that he was delivered to hospital because of liver cancer at the end of June . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years of prison for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; since he was involved in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifes@@ to which calls the democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work in 2010 with the Nobel Peace Prize .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred to as an &quot; internal matter &quot; and told a speaker , he did not take it as &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this cause with any other country . &quot;
&quot; however , China continues to call up calls from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ in Li@@ u X@@ ia , release or permit treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are fully exploited . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summ@@ ar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Com@@ miss@@ ar of the United Nations for Human Rights , met in the end of June Chinese official to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment whether the United Nations should exert pressure in order to allow Li@@ u abroad a treatment . &quot;
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ end have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway arrived at Sto@@ cks , after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was given to Li@@ u , even though the Norwegian Government continued to do nothing with the decision . &quot;
&quot; the diplomatic relations were continued until December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon went to China , since exports have been largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the news spread out that Li@@ u had seriously fallen ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope for unconditional release for expression and lu@@ d Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
because of his imprisonment it was not able to increase its price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a decision where China was requested to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house arrest and permit him to seek medical support where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top Diplom@@ at@@ ine of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us as she said in an explanation on 30 June . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to address all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all the visits you wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States
&quot; ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared with that the Americans &quot; wish him that he has the opportunity for treatment abroad , in so far as it helps with his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person at the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary , Pol@@ ley , announced the message agency AF@@ P on June 27th , announced that the message delivered by the Chinese authorities to release not only Li@@ u , but also release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the invitation of the U.S. Embassy moved an angry answer from China to himself , with the declaration of the foreign affairs that &quot; &quot; no country have the right to interfere and ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the couple following :
&quot; protection and freedom such as travel free movement and access to the medical care of its choice , which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal systems as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merkel ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a congress in order to push the Chinese government to push forward Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;
I urge China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that he can embark on proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; the German government spokes@@ person Steff@@ en Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hoping that Li@@ u wants to get all the medical support he needed &quot; and that an &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 Summit in Hamburg .
previously diplomatic sources reported in Beijing of the news agency Re@@ uters that China had great concern whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could over@@ lap the visit to Hamburg .
Canada
&quot; on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um to ask China to provide adequate medical care and give it the opportunity to make sure of his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us attorney told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ us wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that there is Li@@ u not allowed to speak with someone outside , including his lawyers , speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells more :
&quot; Canada calls on China to safeguard its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , to protect and protect those rights reserved for the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry of France called for China in an explanation on 29 June to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments that he , independently where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family can have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news station France Info already reported that the French government would like to welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there will be no further information whether France will resume him . &quot;
Taiwan in Taiwan
&quot; the Council of the Festival in Taiwan demanded China on June 27th , to release Li@@ u and demonstrate a greater tolerance to those who are campa@@ igning for political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Party of Democratic Party , China also called on the sick of intellectual Li@@ u to treat yourself in Taiwan . &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed us very concerned in a statement on 28 June by Li@@ u and gave us that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my faith that the initiatives that he took and for whom he was rigor@@ ously punished to a harmonious , more stable and aff@@ lu@@ ent China , which in turn contributed to a peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and the rule of law in China . &quot;

is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice , Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am should be regarded as a city in Singapore . &quot;
this statement triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting at the meeting of the international branch of the Law@@ yers of the State of New York , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because it was compared to Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he support Singapore to be considered as a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Minister , &quot; &quot; turning the logic to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifice , to create this valuable country , we say that we are not a country in the end . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a mandatory injury . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my land , Wh@@ ose land is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons for Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ at were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries , in view of which it appeared inevitably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , he def@@ ends the idea that Singapore with cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York should be compared , equally cities that are permanently managed by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the core of the theme , the good old body of the author@@ itarian rulers appear to be the pre@@ dominant logic , as it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; during the last week of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , the answers to his American guests were given to us regarding our press , our predic@@ tive , our political system really non @-@ answers . &quot;
corresponding questions tar@@ ed with non @-@ answers ir@@ rational way .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am to make his opinion clear as it did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , for which country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I understand nothing . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our more K Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am took the effort to take this point unless he was paid high , in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by posting on the blog his comment , he points to the critics that you should begin to read the entire collaboration of the conference so that you can see the context of the statements of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am better , according to which Singapore was a city and no country . &quot;
read the in@@ scription .
&quot; he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore be so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot;
&quot; he lived Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) . &quot;
&quot; he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; be no country &quot; , &quot; he obviously does not mean it in that sense ! &quot;
&quot; C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , who is the leader of a growing generation , such a polem@@ ical statement . &quot;
&quot; I am about what the Minister of Justice in Singapore has said , very embarrassed ... &quot;
at least I knew by Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de who expect me - whether I agree with them or not ; but that &apos;s another thing .
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes that he really is associated with what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review breaks the weaknesses of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; &quot; believed a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ den@@ d@@ speaker ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we only regarded as independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , on which country go back to the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is both land and city . &quot;
&quot; as he plays an important role within the government , the statements by Mr Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the hus@@ ks consider their military service , they only defend their city but do not their country ? &quot;
who must pay our Prime Minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink human resource ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; add the Jour@@ ney of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ y@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore and was always a city : &quot;
&quot; I have not said , what I said ... &quot;
this phrase seems to have become anno@@ yed in many ways ...
nobody ever told that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defense of the country , above all &quot; etc . &quot; but that is not quite true . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .
the myth of &quot; cute Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Fl@@ anders .
scre@@ enshot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editors : what is the most mis@@ used aspect about your home or home country ?
their answers will be published here as part of a continuous series with the rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
&quot; the question which is asked to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; I answered . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live in Japan and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered polite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ or by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; on my clar@@ inet usually follows the default answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , I@@ ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans may be bo@@ iled internally against anger , but when they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t bother . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know himself , there is little that distinguishes us Can@@ adi@@ ans of Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans have a Canadian flag visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans however ... .
&quot; so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and September 11 . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always worn small m@@ ap@@ ed sheets of their luggage to be distinguished from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
gender @-@ sex marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are polite .
we obviously say very often &quot; sorry . &quot;
Canada is alleged as the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
&quot; first , I have many American friends , which I admired very much . &quot;
it wouldn &apos;t make me difference if you would like to change it with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamps &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first , as &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; to be called , is basically to be sp@@ icious , but like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but tragic figure N@@ ed Fl@@ anders from &quot; The Simp@@ son &quot; ( who has a own Canadian double @-@ go@@ ers ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Fl@@ anders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing that you can encounter . &quot;
being harmless is to be in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and no attention to earn .
&quot; this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around one . &quot;
&quot; I would even come as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone , a leading property of Can@@ adi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; what si@@ ders describe as &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans often talk about the fence with neighbours .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then J@@ ustin Tru@@ de@@ au stepped on stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ ded Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a music scene in Thailand &apos;s famous pop band has released a music video that par@@ o@@ ded the Jun@@ ta , which took the power and restore the civil government in spite of its promise to restore the country . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Col@@ our describes a young man who tells about what rules his girlfriend makes him .
&quot; although not expressly , the music video refers to the continuing military power of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band has been praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was an amazing success .
&quot; only within the first three days , the video was shared on Facebook 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin Video &quot; Der dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists called to the public to look at this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai politics , in particular how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; take a look at the videos of the video , which refer to some of the political issues that Thailand has consistently pursued in the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may be based on the dra@@ inage section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the He@@ er &apos;s absolute decision @-@ making , on important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program for &quot; &quot; setup change &quot; &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals who are regarded by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to protect activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose a new unit has also been established in the army , the online content monitors and individuals who have been thrown , the monarchy was sl@@ ander@@ ed , pro@@ secuted . &quot;
Thailand sets a stri@@ de against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic Maj@@ este ) .
on 20 May 2014 the war was declared war law .
two days later it came to a coup d army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to be pursued , their decision is to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts they warned that the purchase need@@ less and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video it is even shown , how persons can be thrown into a black supply carriage , before it brings them into an interfer@@ ing camp , another problem case . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are sitting in prison , because they have alleged &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users will be threatened by long arrest , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the song members of the band showed the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; im@@ it@@ ated , which was already used by put@@ sch opponents during protests 2014 . &quot;
life continues on the ruins of gh@@ ost cities in Eastern Asia .

&quot; the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the OC Media website and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
the post @-@ war company is only very slowly reco@@ vering in East @-@ Asia Minor - mainly in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; it has now been over 20 years since the Georgian war officially ended , but his sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the deserted villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the carbon basin of Ab@@ y@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , South @-@ Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ers and Armenia lived and worked in the area to So@@ yu@@ etz@@ als . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
&quot; today , for the largest part of the Russians and ab@@ ov@@ ens live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost cities in Ab@@ le @-@ Asia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived there today are only a few hundred people living in these gh@@ ost cities . &quot;
this is a characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district of 16@@ ,000 people , after having barely increased over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; all this is a consequence of the war , &quot;
&quot; the empty fif@@ ths of the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s , called Christ &apos;s Chron@@ icles , stand symbolic for the decline and the devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are dropped and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local elderly .
he begins a conversation and it falls hard to finish this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is un@@ ambiguous . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were church centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens who ministered to all of the community . &quot;
&quot; now , there is only paved road with remaining gran@@ deur buildings . &quot;
&quot; people who once lived in this place and left their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union , have meanwhile abandoned the district . &quot;
in the gh@@ ost town D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live approximately fifty residents .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a in the other villages it looks similar .
&quot; the Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ tsch@@ ino@@ kas , which is still one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately pull back . &quot;
&quot; our Mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden to us , that is all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pered with her girlfriend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ s@@ istence sector ( cultivation of agricultural products for self @-@ use ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable @-@ growing . &quot;
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
the District administration supplies free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build Zu@@ zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or aun@@ t G@@ alya worked as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to A@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; in spite of her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left afraid to leave Asia @-@ Asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ le @-@ Asia , &quot; she tells . &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to accept financial help from her daughter and insist that she is supporting her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly pensions are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ alya told that she and other villagers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 year old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are we visit us .
but we cannot do so constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; as she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha &quot; , &quot; T@@ ante G@@ alya calls her to her . &quot; &quot; they said , we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build Zu@@ zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ational Nat@@ ascha along with her husband and the five common children lived in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she reminded of the thor@@ n before the war .
&quot; despite the relatives , which live in central Russian , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia broke away ) , they didn &apos;t have the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ li@@ i ( ste@@ ad@@ j@@ aup@@ t@@ stadt in Ab@@ f@@ asia ) . &quot;
&quot; we want to build a house there , but this will still take a little &quot; , &quot; she explains it . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives about $ 9 children for every child .
her husband works in the leng@@ then .
the young family has their own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ ash@@ as Kindergarten was once found , they hold pigs , cows , t@@ aps and chickens . &quot;
she tells that there was first a very scary situation as many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time she lost her anxi@@ ousness .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has to do something with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was little work and everyone lived like it was right .
every day I remember how the city and the war once were .
&quot; when our conversation comes to the end , a small boy has passed by us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy hun@@ ted him back .
he plays with the ball who then desc@@ ends up the hill .
a group of children pursu@@ es the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them throw stones at the exp@@ ir@@ ed building . &quot;
&quot; these ruins are part of their childhood , which disp@@ ose of uncertainty in their lives . &quot;
you do not know it any other way .

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; migrants &quot; on their long journey
&quot; Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez direc@@ ts a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border between Mexico and Guatemala . &quot;
photo : Amy Br@@ ack .
this article of Amy Br@@ ack was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org .
&quot; across the way of migrants , Europe or Latin America cross , certain places for their hospitality will be known . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is run by a 5@@ 9@@ - year @-@ old Mex@@ i@@ kan@@ erin , a small woman with a cor@@ als pink bril@@ liance and golden ear@@ rings in t@@ ed@@ dy bear . &quot;
&quot; it is called Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and grew up in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name of Mama Africa . &quot;
&quot; this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians , who are on transit . &quot;
the hotel has no more charm .
&quot; for about 2.@@ 50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms , with col@@ on , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rots in a cage .
&quot; there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless , hundreds of African and Haiti have come here . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells people in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call : &quot; m@@ ama Africa ! &quot;
where are you mom Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; currently , it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on cart@@ ons . &quot;
it does not want to reject anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy them medicines that they can &apos;t pay , she masks them with a bal@@ sam that filled out from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived recently . &quot;
I asked him if Mama was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ sta@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ ack .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it fits to her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children again . &quot;
&quot; you have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move towards north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard of other way@@ far@@ ers from Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a famous name on the track , &quot; &quot; explains Mr. Michel@@ et , a Guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells you that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel the track together and that Afri@@ cans were already talking on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; as many of his companion managers , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months now : he sold SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ p@@ ses .
I ask him if he is in contact with Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; Mama Africa is our Mother and we will never leave her again , &quot; he answered smiling . &quot; we will always be in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests to send their often text messages if they have gone to gr@@ aces or to report about the course of their journey .
they explained that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
&quot; she does not know much about Africa , but their guests have brought her to prepare chicken like in Ghana . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants that travel through tap@@ ach@@ ula .
&quot; at the other end of the city , there is a dead end road to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; during this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have recorded migrants in their small house . &quot;
he is a poli@@ cem@@ an and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; for the moment 25 people are here , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on blankets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking spot outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are doing .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived there for three years , he was rejected by a raid on his work place from the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants , who travels through tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ do@@ va Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he had escaped in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to squee@@ ze him out of money without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he was asked for an accommodation and a unknown , one all@@ ot@@ ant , has offered him their roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and tried to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back to the house of Mama Africa is all again full of guests .
in the courses the travellers consult with their phones .
&quot; a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , much from Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems to be happy that their house is full , but it is also nostal@@ gically , because of those who have gone away . &quot;
like a proud grandmother to feed them in their album with numerous photos .
&quot; there is one of their daughter with African hair care who made her a Kund@@ alini , some photos of her grandchildren and many travellers more , boy and Old . &quot;
she was sad to laugh at her shortly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; &quot; repeated every time . &quot; &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
&quot; a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users , &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in the west of China , are forced to install a Spy@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on 10 July , the mobile users of the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the city of Ur@@ um@@ ba received a mobile alert , in which it has to install the District Government , a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web cleansing &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , the app is said to get access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because they had installed shortly after they had installed the app , messages with a private We@@ chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the message of the police , the app would determine and follow the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a shelter with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the block por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , trou@@ gh and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they are spending online , and to remot@@ ely control their home network . &quot;
this app with the filters for min@@ ors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote &quot; state actors or even h@@ acker could manipulate the home network of a person or to ste@@ al the home network . &quot;
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reports on digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often dark for those who in distant , sup@@ pressed ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit distur@@ ban@@ ces and dissatisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often classi@@ fy extreme cens@@ ored and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ in@@ ous Internet . &quot;
&quot; this published on Twitter @-@ based media out@@ let &quot; &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( S@@ EC@@ I ) , the cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos from a Check@@ point , where the poli@@ c@@ emen showed the residents at optional , whether they had installed the monitoring app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people are installing the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point using a device without this software , they could be de@@ tained by up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
&quot; you have forced the people to use devices , which are intended for older people . &quot;
this is a form of captivity to the imprisonment of rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( S@@ EC@@ C ) , also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , out of which the software can lift up a Windows operating system and thus gets full access to the hard drive of your computer . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobil@@ es become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang . &quot;
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the directives of the city party council to minim@@ ise the distribution of illegal content .
&quot; all government groups , authorities and with the party linked institutions including universities and research centres are oblig@@ ated to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office in operation of their computer and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a current report from Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new monitoring methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published on June 27th in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , a regulation with the directive to all the inhabitants and entrepreneurs , to the 1st August their &quot; personal ID maps , mobil@@ es , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media storage cards . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; to identify and destroy . however , this action is violated the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible off@@ ence , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything scre@@ ams after death &quot;

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane wrote his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; distant from our blue , virtual world you look at and show you that you are all alone in a place where everything is important . &quot;
everything has changed after and after and revealed a truth which is clearly identifiable both inside and from outside .
one that makes her name all glory .
one who has crus@@ hed into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but when you get the reality again , and you leave behind the scenes - beyond the spectacle , the beautiful scen@@ eries and performers - turn into being in essence of flesh and blood , and do all the cry of death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts will resolve in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even if the Earth is spinning on the A@@ xis of Un@@ hei@@ ls . it is clear that you are caught here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grandparents , stone built by stone . &quot;
&quot; they have been arrested me and my father three times , but that did not have been able to judge &quot; &quot; my lesson &quot; , &quot; as the chief of the security services they formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he created his power over us by proof that he even destroyed the simplest concepts that we knew .
&quot; five teenagers were destroyed during a peaceful protest , as we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution . &quot;
it was enough to make the town the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
&quot; all the city districts were sought , but my own not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , reg@@ is@@ eless , at the wrong time , even though I had no high demands on a city that is up to the arteries with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; during the third night , things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply in the district had to work . &quot;
&quot; I broke the still@@ ness , by crying several times &quot; &quot; Al@@ mighty &quot; &quot; from my house . &quot;
I heard my voice contradic@@ ted by the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends closed to me ; we were comm@@ ited to a glorious picture that fully filled my expectations . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you become aware that you are liberated in the lamp from the lamp , but it is simply not interested in the t@@ weak . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my Father : &quot; &quot; make you ready , we meet with the military safety @-@ building . &quot;
he placed on .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low down - nothing can give you your voice , after you put it all the way up to the office of the security service from the body . &quot;
I came there .
&quot; the Upper Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also . &quot;
&quot; the wa@@ ist Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak , &quot; &quot; let me hear how thou shou@@ ld@@ est &quot; &quot; ahu &quot; &quot; or you are only gr@@ ace@@ ful enough to scre@@ am if we are not near . &quot;
his h@@ water @-@ filled eyes were based on me .
&quot; and you wonder what to look at my eyes , not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood before this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was about my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity , perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure of my thing as I answered : &quot; I didn &apos;t think that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I never stopped to look to your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I do not regret a word from what I said . &quot;
&quot; he puts him in sol@@ itary , and his father equally with them . &quot;
&quot; his father equally with them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the st@@ ank of this distorted sentence is up to me today in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a spiritual torture that I was exposed to months . &quot;
I scre@@ ams the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
&quot; then again through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a walk to the individual cells . &quot;
I would like to show me all the details exactly before I cared for the room .
otherwise they have probably shared a larger cell at this time .
&quot; I have to share it with only one single prisoner , and can put me immediately without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a couple of minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I laid back on a long @-@ proven communication method : beat the fist against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my Z@@ ellen@@ gen@@ ces was a &quot; &quot; first &quot; &quot; prisoner &quot; . &quot; &quot;
after a long hesitation he finally answered me .
apparently in none of the surrounding cells was a respected man middle age that looks similar to me and is called &quot; doctor . &quot;
&quot; in total darkness can be seen in me no distinctive facial extracts , and doctors are not there here ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
&quot; perhaps someone , whose voice sounds similar to my sounds ? &quot;
all answers are of his existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will immediately listen .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would hate him when I stay . &quot;
liar .
&quot; if I would like to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to sell all these cro@@ ws , which lab@@ elled on fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance I still hear it &quot; &quot; all@@ ahu &quot; &quot; scre@@ am . &quot;
&quot; it must be approximately 10 am in the evening ; always at this time , the cri@@ es , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that presented us the Gre@@ ys in Person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; An@@ play@@ ation on 13 S@@ ure of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to listen .
&quot; this was the secret to protect us : to protect the state security before us and prevent the terrorists in us , they speak in al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - thus they played their sec@@ t@@ arian black@@ mailing card , and cried the close perspectives of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a home , this is not a land ; it is a curse to call it co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their sound into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I cared for the audi@@ t@@ orium and tre@@ ad on Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me . &quot;
&quot; he begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions that make him si@@ der@@ ailed : &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can close as much more important to your life than to protest on demonstrations and protest on demonstrations that will soon be an end soon . &quot;
I did not answer .
&quot; I got used to it , not to answer . &quot;
I really cannot say exactly when insul@@ ts and stro@@ kes have become a friendly communication for me to an ordinary means of communication .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
&quot; any voice in me said that I &apos;d probably used to get used to it , to be punished , although I had nothing to earn this punishment . &quot;
on punishment in all its diversity .
its command is to plu@@ ck me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the loving &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your Hen@@ ker rejo@@ iced in your scre@@ am .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him and you can not with@@ hold your cry . &quot;
&quot; my cry did not turn out yet enough , why they were exchanged the pipe through a cable . &quot;
&quot; during my first capture , I asked whether the investig@@ ator had worked earlier than trash cans , or whether it belonged to normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined , in order to present us the ones from their point of view , great invention of a giant cab@@ al . &quot;
&quot; within one hour , three of them changed , while I was still in the row . &quot;
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , why I heard to cry . &quot;
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and found no favour of all that it was next to an electri@@ cally invited hook .
&quot; electricity flo@@ wed down my entire body , enough to provide my whole area . &quot;
&quot; my semi @-@ nude body , which lay down on the ground , was the perfect power manager . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; some hours went , which came to me like minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the dawn ful@@ fills the room . &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I rep@@ lied with the voice of an exhaus@@ tible youth : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must make fear@@ ful worries . &quot;
&quot; be silent and gone , you will be reloc@@ ated . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they always had me released .
where do they lead me away ? !
the j@@ ord@@ al R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b speaks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community ; freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b spends most of his time in@@ doors ; sometimes he lo@@ dges to his canvas , to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
but where one can rely on it is a cigarette between his fingers or its nicotine Be@@ jag@@ ged lips .
&quot; he lives on the top floor of his family house , which was owned by them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel saw its occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they had lived as rocky ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and asks their long @-@ proven opinions about gender roles , sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ music . &quot;
&quot; with his music that often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , but also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics are not only in his hometown Am@@ man relevance , but also in cities that come from Damascus to the whole of San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his mind , and he can have compassion on the terrible consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not open it openly , he swe@@ pt a special turn against the US foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , to do anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees &quot; - so he describes himself , even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own living conditions so , &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , while he sho@@ ok in water in two cups . it is the holy month of Ramad@@ an ; during this time it is planned for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the j@@ ord@@ al law also states that public consumption of food during Ramad@@ an is illegal .
&quot; obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has had little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
basically the s@@ lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the s@@ wa@@ iter of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose is first of freedom .
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when you take a look at the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; of this , one simply avo@@ ids the basic things to do - as in the public during Ramad@@ an to drink water - to not land in prison . &quot;
recently the Interior Ministry of Jord@@ ani@@ ens put an appearance of the band Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la already for the second time .
&quot; a few parliamentary parliament@@ arians who support the Islamic Action Front - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual fron@@ ts , Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , who contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and be the main reason for the concert . &quot;
&quot; the dep@@ uties and former spokes@@ person in the Islamic coalition D@@ IMA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N , that the concert was &quot; just &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot;
&quot; many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism that demand the long @-@ proven legitimacy of author@@ itarian regimes throughout the region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la adopted the j@@ ord@@ anic people as &quot; progressive suppor@@ ter of human rights &quot; which continued to use for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement probably should not be easy @-@ sided rhet@@ oric , but in fact a more and more evident @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan reflect that in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs work clearly appears . &quot;
in 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b traditional gender standards is to be Lei@@ be by putting his vision of the fate of Arab women who have imagined sex .
&quot; the image shows the skel@@ eton of a clearly down @-@ known woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen . &quot;
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who really should trust .
&quot; over the past few years , the number of &apos; honorary mor@@ dial &apos; has increased the in@@ official outside in Jordan . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honorary mor@@ als in 2016 reached their peak ; however , it still appears that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who tried and support victims of kill@@ ings or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on migration from the year 1954 women who are exposed to danger of in@@ vigor@@ ous violence , &quot; &quot; and for their release is often a long term of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee on the part of the family need nothing to happen . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ bs Music also enjoys great popularity , and is known not to res@@ h@@ ind the subjects that are long in his country as tab@@ u . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes that his work is political , however , a fact that he is his music that is full of explicit accus@@ ations on sexuality , freedom and expression not to be separated from politics . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; he was said to me , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack .
&quot; in &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; gh@@ o@@ eb &quot; &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
&quot; the list of songs that are politically politically , can be continued . &quot;
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market in which one can get in his words , &quot; &quot; whether it is faith or non @-@ belief , He@@ ter@@ o- or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of g@@ ays and les@@ bians and that comments on equality between LG@@ BT@@ Q + -@@ individuals is still strongly cens@@ ored up in 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b introduced an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ inal Online@@ programme Ro@@ ya to later remember that his comments from the context was ri@@ pped , scre@@ wed and in his opinion been cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube , it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but was only a edited version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is open to the Arabic LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexu@@ als do not speak to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who is still in mind thanks to its homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ something , who later worked on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ an@@ ier not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so h@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ y kingdom , nothing new is new that the government attacks attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ al news service held several former government members and members of the teacher , with the reasoning , they had expressed critical to the problems linked to deep in the country that are deeply rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , the concert of H@@ da@@ i@@ bs believes only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan River . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress is a continuous giving and taking . Jordan has gone for the second time in a row a gig , but the path of progress - so it looks da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , than@@ king and inner changes . he is sure that these changes from day to day at the heart of the j@@ ord@@ an society take place . &quot;
&quot; finally , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , also , from an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he dreams not only of it , his work until Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of it . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region is getting involved with music , art and literature a genuine and basic openness - and not by bombs , exten@@ tions and artificial nature . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until then , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue , and therefore also resist . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these great , extravag@@ ant warri@@ ors are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; it is thought that there is a variant of tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually recorded in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ cus . another theory states that the wag@@ ons , the drums , and the tan@@ ces mar@@ ched more than one thousand years and mar@@ ched from a time , in the armies from the west of Japan in the northeast mar@@ ched to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to catch some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . &quot;
I was looking forward to seeing the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two wag@@ ons are straight to be seen .
&quot; nonetheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the fo@@ uta Festival is the only tru@@ thful - and in addition to a stunning way of spending its summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and looked at the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a 18 meter high tower was amazing .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; external appearance and body care were so important as in this history , as they help to maintain the Peruvian youth from the crime and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ dres@@ ser . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where road @-@ consuming and illegal drug trafficking are everyday . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , appearance and therefore also the fancy hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ esis ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ esis ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ esis ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) , has resulted in becoming increasingly more normal citizens in the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can make these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , who go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers to Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , who has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there are experts to compete against each other , who can create from them the ec@@ centric L@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batt@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions like the school of August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , who found themselves in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people of it , their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools , and instead of poor advice on hair@@ dres@@ sers you can find work . &quot;
motivated by this activity and the varied possibilities have seen dozens of young people that they can take a profession which is currently fashionable .
&quot; the school offered special training workshops in March , and reported on some of their successes : &quot;
&quot; 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because of love for the children we have built this educational community . &quot;
Colombia : Liebes@@ letters at guer@@ rilla warfare

&quot; the following article is the edited version of the paper &quot; &quot; Liebes@@ message &quot; &quot; at guer@@ rilla warfare , &quot; which has released the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
this entry is published here within the framework of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not even more important , people who feel overwhelming , affection with affection ? &quot;
&quot; this question left the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Foundation of Bogot@@ a and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation , and inspired it to the &quot; &quot; Cart@@ as p@@ or la Re@@ public@@ li@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) , the young people urged to write guer@@ rilla letters . &quot;
&quot; only recently , her country was the venue of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiation , the Colom@@ bian Government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ rilla war F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces ) , which forms the closing of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; international was considered to be the sig@@ nat@@ ing of the peace contract , as significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos received for its merits for the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; in front of the Colom@@ bian , there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; guer@@ rilla warfare , who lived many years in illegal bearings , were exposed to war rhet@@ oric and imposed around the clock their weapons , now need to be integrated into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society in turn , which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guer@@ rilla warfare , must now engage in their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bian had to close together and would have to help with the integration process .
and that is exactly what they did before : until now thousands of young people already wrote letters - love message to former guer@@ ri@@ fighters to welcome them back in society .
the goal of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former guer@@ ri@@ cation - which then should be given personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the reconciliation was created at the world summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , who took place in February 2017 in Bogot@@ á . there were Leonardo and Cr@@ istian the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ thi , which was awarded in 2014 the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; explained that we love the people whom we love , am Valentine &apos;s Day , thousands of love letters , but those who need much more necessary . &quot;
&quot; he plan , he told him to share his love with people this year , the most urgent need . &quot;
&quot; thus the plan , letters full of hope and support for former fighters of F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and have to build themselves a new life . &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story of a common history of peace , &quot; &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; up to now , more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and Bogot@@ á . &quot;
I would never thought that someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were handed over to the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca on 19 March in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
&quot; a group of 40 students of the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation of Bogot@@ a , in the camp to bring the letters personally . &quot;
&quot; the members of the F@@ ARC did so on how they had done it earlier , in order to counter the commands of their leaders . &quot;
but this time they received no orders but letters full of under@@ lining people from all over the country .
&quot; it was a very moving moment for all parties . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can be through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between , &quot; told the policy science student Manuela Im@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
Sandra Par@@ ra : an employee of the governors of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience as follows :
after we had passed the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of guer@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut , in which the guer@@ ri@@ ots live ) , I saw a guer@@ rilla war that wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down , because next to him on the bed was a m@@ GL pom@@ e@@ gran@@ ates , a deadly weapon in the thor@@ ns . &quot;
&quot; and I said it nevertheless , and asked , &quot; hello , what do they do ? &quot; he answered , &quot; I rep@@ lied to a letter that someone has written to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hope@@ ful letter .
&quot; never before in my life someone has written something so beautiful , so I responded to it . I suddenly got the tears over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I embr@@ aced him completely and set me next to the pom@@ e@@ gran@@ ates .
&quot; perhaps he was sorry for the war , was sorry to be all the years of loyal companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him to write this letter . &quot;
the man told me more about his life . he had never had something different from life than war . the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before the hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I have never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society out there that wa@@ its with open arms .
&quot; until now , I just learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reigns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; in the pr@@ el@@ ude , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came into a discussion round . &quot;
the students were all grown up as a war and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
&quot; therefore the leader of the F@@ ARC the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; &quot; many years ago we experienced how social injustice from the State on the whole Colom@@ bian people worked out . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to shaping the society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
&quot; listening to these people who had never found heard before and had no electoral law , and to recognize that people who were often seen as monsters and even hate people who were surrounded by their living conditions and their environment was quite painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality , in which the land lives , does me sore . &quot;
&quot; but it comfor@@ ted me that all men - including those who have killed and so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
colum@@ bi@@ kers was mis@@ made that after dis@@ ar@@ ming peace would reign .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as there are inequality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will be always people who are willing to hold the weapons and protest to their rights , and that is completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we call upon all the defen@@ ders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology they belong to - to dream about all those who dream of a land in the war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring the sacrifice , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those amongst us who will defend life as the basis of existence , will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; hom@@ osexual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ ca@@ sian region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical , and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
with terror activists experienced the coverage of the last months over the persecution of sw@@ ul@@ ls men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but the threat , which is like a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ ome on the LG@@ BT@@ Q community , is not just over night . &quot;
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who spoke some of her experiences with us , and talked to us what has happened in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal position in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international headlines from the world after several months after reports published , torture , torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was released by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the No@@ wa@@ ja Gas@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , the suspi@@ cious que@@ er men mar@@ es and they found in secret prisons in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; ever since their childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; when they grew , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , which was why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen was experienced by the genital equ@@ ator of her house@@ wife , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
&quot; out of fear for their lives , she moved in the US to the end of the US . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a honorary assistant at a human rights organization .
&quot; one day , I told me that someone needed my help . &quot;
&quot; it was a friend of D@@ ag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ wife , who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took them without hesitation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , he made a friend of whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that the photos of my documents made through the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ app .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was just going to show a few shopping bags from the seat of my car , I heard a men &apos;s voice : &quot; &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time at Che@@ chen : &quot; how long will you still honor the family , du Sch@@ and@@ fle@@ ck ? &quot;
I knew the person not .
&quot; I know only that there was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost the consciousness and woke up in the hospital again .
apparently some women had received everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two sampling in my right lung . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : in which sick , have you been laid - in the men or women of women ? &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are outdated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me to the women . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I am very grateful to him . &quot;
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office , I got to do it with the fear ; it was a muscular , a ca@@ sian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he was dis@@ respectful with me .
I spent more than one month in hospital .
last February I got threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote to me - relatives , foreigners , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a nightmare .
my family was visited by neighbors and several remote relatives .
&quot; the slo@@ wed to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that all was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they had absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by talking up without the streets ; others wanted me to be on the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex , that everything was bad , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have grain size C - what could I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how has your family tried to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still hard for them .
some older people once said my mother on the road .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has not only damaged your family , but the whole Republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot stir you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she lay a stri@@ ck around the neck .
luckily the neighbours came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dark@@ ened window wash@@ ers and a numer@@ al plate with a 95 square .
&quot; after it happened for the third time , it was clear to me that there was something lazy . &quot;
my human rights @-@ friends over@@ threw the numer@@ ical signs - it turned out that I have been following .
OC Media : how did you have fled ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for safety reasons I don &apos;t want to do their name , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help I left the country , but then something un@@ belief . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought it , without record me , without notice , without everything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the trash .
came up and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my cell phone .
&quot; the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ app , I got a message : &quot; you do not believe , you would be sure , just because you have left the country ? &quot;
&quot; our people know already , in which hotel you st@@ ume . you even know your room number . &quot;
just to prove it to you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we do not talk about sex equ@@ als , this is a tab@@ u@@ topic . &quot;
I still use some traditional ca@@ tho@@ lic elements still in me .
&quot; I also wish it , this spiritual barrier can not be overcome . &quot;
&quot; I am always saying that as long as my mother is in life , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I actually give me trouble to see how the person looks out of her past - so to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I have submitted a report last week in Washington .
for this I needed current information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke with someone who has sent a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during Ramad@@ an was not being arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ramad@@ an could hardly wait , and he didn &apos;t closed a new wave . &quot;
&quot; most likely , they will now concentrate on family and relatives . &quot;
&quot; that mean I , they probably invite the relatives before , these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; experienced by blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are now even gay men in these secrets ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says it would not be very many .
&quot; if , above all those who have no rich relatives or have dropped out of their own relatives to face Kad@@ y@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they will be listed there so that they can present them as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say , &quot; &quot; should they be killed , one will show their bodies on television and claim them , they would have attacked any village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply gone , but targeted to radic@@ alize itself . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : is it just a reminder , or do you have a source for this information ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in Ar@@ gun and a half months .
he says that many people had disappeared in this prison after having grown beard .
there has been nothing new about them since .
they have simply taken them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself as these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , so far there has been no reports before . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; do you know if these per@@ secu@@ tions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people , who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation &quot; have already been in the past ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I always wor@@ e my hair for ever .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think I was already very much known in 2003 when I lived there - and I never had problems .
in Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was considered , I never had problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to approach us to &quot; &quot; civilian &quot; , &quot; but ultimately has thrown back to the stone @-@ time . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my eyeb@@ rows were exhausted ; I had colored eyelashes , carried skirts and short tail . &quot;
the Safety Department of Sh@@ aria has never even curved me a hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every night , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we have never been insul@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is an expression : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is called &quot; Sp@@ otte not over the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
you often say it to children if those who make themselves jo@@ vial of sick .
&quot; OC Media : so , they simply shut their eyes in front of you because they believed , you are sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they have never been offen@@ ded , never hun@@ ted and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this Gn@@ ad@@ ens@@ ity stopped ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak on television on mor@@ als . &quot;
&quot; he spoke not about us , but primarily about the behavior of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , one could feel like the people of the town began to change . &quot;
&quot; who had che@@ ered and yellow previously , considered you at once with suspicion . &quot;
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the Republic constantly disappeared . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I did not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
&quot; apart from that , I am still working as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize teac@@ up , meetings , I buried them to the hospital and help them to get f@@ ences . &quot;
I don &apos;t have a pen@@ ny for a long time .
I discovered these people myself when I cast refuge .
I am Mus@@ lim@@ a and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is al@@ ant .
&quot; so is nature , that has purely nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; that is exactly the same as Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who want to prophes@@ y you with foam in front of the mouth , that there are no g@@ ays in them . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ ag@@ est@@ ans have which , the Kab@@ ard@@ iner , who , the Russians have also what ; on the whole planet there are - but &quot; &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear what to listen . &quot;
&quot; here , I meet here so many men out of the Caucasus . &quot;
many of them - practicing Muslims that go into the mosque and during Ramad@@ an - live together with men .
&quot; you know , a lot of thinking about men &apos;s identity in men who love men , and they believe that you change their sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a Tru@@ g@@ utter . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different kinds of sensation in order to be accurate , different ways of life . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry , that I will be so personally here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I am not very sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase in suicide within the impover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since the last few months , there is a strong rise of suicide . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August rep@@ lied the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the lim@@ eli@@ ght . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he ashamed of his own helpl@@ ess@@ ness that may arise in@@ capacity for his family , such ancestors work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and want to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; a video posted on YouTube kept the moments , after he had made himself up . &quot;
&quot; some people made it quick to clear the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything anymore . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that has happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and campa@@ ig@@ ners warn of that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights announces that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ des Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - hangs . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : it was all family fathers , who felt thanks to the persecution on the part of the Iranian government , helpl@@ ess and in@@ capable to feed their families and go to safe work . &quot;
Arabic Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , where the majority of Iran living in Iran living in Iran was shaken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to deny their liveli@@ hoods . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arabic Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi @-@ monarchy took power and 1925 great efforts to end the ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most popular and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy still develops slowly , and the native population only gets little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often the victims of untreated diseases , hunger and hard@@ ships . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime denied systematic jobs in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of stems , the waters from the Arab territories in the Persian area , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are located . &quot;
these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation in the region through drought and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm trees .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ k youths now increased to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Direc@@ torate General for co @-@ operation , work and social welfare , announces that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who finished a job , finished 55 % a further school and have 45 % a university degree . &quot;
a systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance .
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial discrimination &quot; , &quot; led to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ w@@ azi men . &quot;
Do@@ him@@ i said that particularly unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of Ah@@ wa@@ z new to @-@ coming ethnic Persian and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process :
&quot; since function@@ aries and institutions are preferred non @-@ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi movement will disp@@ ose of access to employment opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance by young Arabs , and force them to earn their living outside their homeland Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their pre@@ - and surname to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ azi , as even Arabic names do not toler@@ ated at the workplace , because the speaking of the Arabic language or the wearing of Arabic clothes . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances that have to endure the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi , human rights activists alarm , before the situation is explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is prev@@ ent@@ able .

why I not identify with femin@@ ism even with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ als
details of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons License .
&quot; the following article is an revised version of the opinion published by Ay@@ om@@ ide , and was originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ Min@@ as website . the article was subject to several discussions where many different positions were expressed . &quot;
you can read in the comments under the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a feminist , many women react - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with Fr@@ ust . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even thought well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments before me why I should be feminist and why all femin@@ ists should be inside .
&quot; for example , that women still earn less money today despite the same formation as men . &quot;
that women still stand under strict observation when it comes to doing what they are allowed to do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
&quot; or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women sooner or later occur in various areas of life to a gl@@ oss ceiling , and that discrimination on account of sex still moves across the many different countries and fai@@ ths . &quot;
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced of this and I am living twice and triple .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet , when I talk to skin color , on racism , on black CIS , women , on black women in the LG@@ BT@@ I@@ Q community or on black women from the Diaspora , when I talk about what kind of we have been physically , psych@@ ologically and verb@@ ally ab@@ used , both in and outside the feminist movement , decide to mention many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; but anyway , everyone agree that women - all women - should come together to up@@ lift their voices and &apos; Kum@@ b@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing &apos; to reach equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about it , that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist moti@@ on@@ ous violence , which we are exposed to black women at two times . &quot;
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and origin @-@ places earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background often referred to school as a white girl because of obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership as white women .
&quot; on the one hand , I want that all women , all the men and all men of any human skin have the same rights ; on the other hand I can consider myself as a black woman , in whose center the white woman stands , which ref@@ uses to relate to both sex and skin colour of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women and over and over again .
&quot; so@@ oth@@ es who be@@ amed 1851 in their speech : &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and also I refuse to maintain a ideology in which the black woman is a human and margin@@ alised being in historical respect . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join me group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs to advance their ego@@ centric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to raise white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping skin color and gender . for some of them continue to keep the importance of black women for feminist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to honor them for the better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different incomes a home and borders himself from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to get rid of myself full of femin@@ ism and join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of being ha@@ sty for a white feminist paradigm that is so stub@@ born that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever , that we can define black women according to our own ideas and move into the sphere that will be made of us for ourselves . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ em , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : &quot; Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing &quot; ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves , in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered that make the black woman . &quot;
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will call immediately separ@@ atism and exclusion after they have read these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
in a bl@@ ur@@ istic environment I can up@@ lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I have existing .
I am recognised because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this paradigm .
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life is neither passed nor ignored . &quot;
pad@@ do@@ ings against pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this contribution by To@@ dd Re@@ ub@@ old was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that has reported in@@ special about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again . &quot;
&quot; over the past 7 years , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ board and can@@ oe - with a particular concern through the Iraqi Kurdistan region . its mission aims to consciously make people aware of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
&quot; in this documentation of Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church . &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # Christmas women ) which reports on violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the persons affected .
&quot; a Police Com@@ miss@@ ar said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , its ex@@ tradition that has become violent towards violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship was a little time , and the police told her statement would not be put to the acts , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena because of failure , also useful the acoustic indicator of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez nothing . &quot;
a few days later the second woman returned its ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women refund at all once , they generally receive no support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases women are also financially dependent on the men who mis@@ missions . this also explains why only 20 % of all women , who admit to be victims of violence , present themselves at all at the law enforcement authorities . &quot;
inhal@@ er 1 beats and Statisti@@ cal 2 Inv@@ isible Mis@@ sions and a legal system that is nothing under ni@@ mm@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays La@@ ws : good approach , fla@@ wed implementation beats and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is hard to determine how many women really mis@@ used , My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for genius questions at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; there are various fields and reports that do not even show the scale of gender violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
however the numbers available are alar@@ ming .
&quot; in 2015 at the district state of the state of 9@@ 600 ads went on account of domestic violence . at 70 % of this , it was about violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ad &apos;s ads came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5,000 ads because of domestic violence at the peace of peace . also here 86 % of the ads came from . &quot;
&quot; in the ads 40 % of women were told that they were physically mis@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen women &apos;s minister@@ ial gifts in Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot; on every woman who is re@@ funded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse notification , come 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; every woman who is re@@ funded because of physical abuse notification , two women who do not do this , &quot; stated in the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s suicide in Paraguay is no own crimes , the law enforcement authorities can not document properly how many women were murdered every year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; alone until August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s su@@ ici@@ des in the country alone . &quot;
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men .

invisible abuse and a legal system that takes nothing
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the fixed friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she called his name of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning they didn &apos;t want to do that , but then there was still . this should always repent . &quot;
&quot; today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos together . but for two years , she carried the psych@@ ic force on one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe recognizable : &quot;
I have never thought that I would even be victims of abuse .
&quot; when I read earlier about it , I always thought that only women are going to be mis@@ understood because they dec@@ eive themselves from violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana uses social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name to name , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during their two year relationship described and told how he was isolated . &quot;
&quot; many people answered their contributions , including Carlos themselves . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ally , whether he ever raised the hand against it , and refused to admit that his behaviour also was a form of abuse . &quot;
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why they had fallen in the so long run by Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of Mis@@ sions had at least a certain degree to blame .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , which is not from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was mis@@ used . &quot;
&quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te CRE@@ O ( &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse . &quot;
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experience , listening to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psych@@ ic abuse .
her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as &apos;s ads with the authorities remained without a result and also of their relatives , they did not receive support . &quot;
&quot; she carried out a trial against her former partner who developed into an in@@ scrut@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and influence of their former partner . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays Law : good approach to lack of implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but are not applied . &quot;
&quot; the display of abuse is a path full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Parliament which was announced under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # Prin@@ ter ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ zw@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ e@@ Wen@@ iger ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
&quot; the original design of the law considers to explain Fem@@ izi@@ d to an independent crime continuance and to pun@@ ish as it is already in neighbouring countries , Argentina and Bolivia . &quot;
&quot; thus , the legis@@ lature has changed in some points to also win the MEPs to the law that p@@ aving the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions that are currently prohibited in Paraguay up to five years in prison . &quot;
&quot; the original bill was planned , most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs , who have to bear the victims of violence at the present time , if they just want to reimbur@@ se and receive a secure accommodation to the state . &quot;
&quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective , if the legis@@ lature has no adequate financial resources available for this purpose : &quot;
in Paraguay is seen as a part of inter@@ personal relations .
&quot; here must take place a re@@ think , so that force is no longer considered to be Nor@@ mal . &quot;
&quot; those who are silent in the face of these facts makes themselves guilty and contributes to the offen@@ ders of the offen@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have to refund so long ad until abuse is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Senate . previously , parts of the law had been changed , but among other things were canc@@ eled by the partners in cases of domestic violence against reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section on Re@@ conci@@ liation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to re@@ attack his victim again .
&quot; however , the strikes of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; of parts of the law applies as a big set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in O@@ man to continue to attack a newspaper after the ban on a newspaper .
&quot; this website was closed on the website of the Information Minister of Information &quot; , &quot; is listed on the homepage of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
more than one year ago the om@@ anic authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n due to their coverage of corruption in the Sultan .
&quot; You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he was imprisoned in prison . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and dent@@ ures Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and put on trial , but came again later . &quot;
&quot; O@@ man has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had set his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur by a state . &quot;
&quot; since then he was dressed in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Minister , Minister of Minister of Finance , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the domination of the sult@@ ans is characterized by the persever@@ ing efforts of security forces , in particular of domestic intelligence , the public liberties , limiting and human rights defen@@ ders , independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers and further activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and citizens , also activists , to express their views on the public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n Zeitung , its closure and the imprisonment three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper which has been reported on corruption in O@@ man ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested , after being published in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 , an article entitled &quot; high @-@ level parties &quot; the hands of the judiciary &quot; was published . in this case it was about corruption in the judiciary and the intervention of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials acc@@ accused the judges of the Supreme Court in O@@ man under pressure to raise a judgment in an inheritance meeting . &quot;
&quot; the paper edition Az@@ am@@ n from July 26 2016 , with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind the hands of the judiciary . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , dent@@ ures Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a member of the editorial committee , charged by the ISS before the special department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
on 9 August 2016 the ISS editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j announced that he had as a chief editor @-@ in @-@ chief for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
&quot; the paper was closed at a time after the information ministers had given the instruction , that &quot; the publication and spread of the newspaper on every way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 the first trial took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari ; al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i .
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also arranged the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were condemned both among other things because of the disorder of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the state of the state . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of an audience &apos;s ban and s@@ lan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and pen@@ alties in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , a one @-@ year professional promise against the two journalists . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a penalty of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) , after having found the use of &quot; a information network to promote the distribution of material that could pose a threat to public order &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a deposit was fixed at the amount of 5000 om@@ an@@ ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the Court of Jud@@ gment . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ al Tribunal spoke to Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced to Al @-@ Ha@@ j a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months of prison . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following the prison sentence of his six month imprisonment . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he was imprisoned in prison .
&quot; the Appe@@ al Court also highlighted the decision of the Information Department , to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the Court , Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper sees still exposed to attacks by the om@@ anic government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Secretary of Ministers sent a directive with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information received a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; has been extended by three additional months and with which the Minister has taken another time against the decision of appeals to permit the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; the ongoing closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases , in which in O@@ man has been violated the press freedom . &quot;
&quot; further injuries include closing the website of the independent magazine Mo@@ w@@ atin and the exercising of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to set up its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to end the comprehensive violation of the press freedom . &quot;
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) asks the om@@ anic authorities : &quot;
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j promptly and un@@ condition@@ ally free ;
&quot; 2 . a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper to create , so that their journalists can follow their work , &quot;
protecting the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances to ensure that human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in O@@ man can have their right human rights work , and without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including judicial ship , can exercise . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or 2016 in Zambia and illustration takes place with its consent
&quot; medical research in Africa is rarely or not mentioned . these are a growing area , addressed one of the most urgent needs of the continent . &quot;
there are two reasons for the need for medical research on site . there are two reasons for the use of global healthcare as many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and malaria have widespread impact than elsewhere in the poorest countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research on these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research , which is carried out by African scientists himself , when setting up their own research capacities in Africa . a major role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or is Director of the centr@@ al@@ ab@@ ors at the Centre for the exploration of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just when the AIDS epidemic was first engra@@ ving effects on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself worked on HIV virus before he decided to go back home , in order to support the Sámi health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ ors discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ concep@@ tions of media about this research . &quot;
( disclaimer : Dr. Warri@@ or speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ pled national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens . &quot;
G@@ V : what are your opinion about important current scientific issues in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
r@@ w : there are no basic research here . we are only putting solutions to which elsewhere has been developed .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always remain a receiver instead of being one of the makers . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not usable in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here . &quot;
G@@ V : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
r@@ w : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are being treated differently well .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not before ?
r@@ w : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : how is the public opinion about science and scientists in Africa ?
r@@ w : there are interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; G@@ V : how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , where should it focus on and how can we support development ? &quot;
r@@ w : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special scientific training ; starting at any age .
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , study of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it . &quot;
G@@ V : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries based on your experience ?
&quot; r@@ w : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the complicated access to scientific expertise that pose challenges . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines make articles only accessible to payment ( the so called &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; this entry by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solution possibilities for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton breeders have been sal@@ ted in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ lia , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA @-@ Astron@@ au@@ ts in Space and consumed . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was done for almost 20 years only by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question , how many sal@@ ads can get there , boundaries . &quot;
&quot; but in the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not use it for breeding . &quot;
&quot; the patents are not only for single varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green ton or curved leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more and more such patents have been registered on ever more plants like grain or cart@@ on varieties . due to these trends , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security around the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia old tradition , Mor@@ ton still finds salad , he still needs longer , since his work is ever more complicated by ever more restrictions . &quot;
it &apos;s like that I would lie down a rock in a river around which I have to pick up .
&quot; so we have to do it now , but it is a break with the breeding @-@ tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go on sal@@ ads too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand in court , no one can breed more of a new sal@@ ads , because all the characteristics are patented , thus trying to bre@@ eder the characteristics that he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and tries to use no material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
it is also connected to a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at the variety of out@@ red@@ ded in the &quot; greenhouse gas station &quot; of the station and ate . there &apos;s tested whether plants in space can be grown .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds more like that would come from the IT sector and not from the area of plant breeding .
&quot; the open source Se@@ ed initiative ( initiative for &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; seeds ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , providing alternatives to copyright protected software . &quot;
she was launched into life to ensure that some plant species and gens are not protected as intellectual property and can be used permanently for plant breeding .
&quot; as part of the initiative , called Os@@ si , we can commit US breeders , that others may be able to use the seed free of them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they can continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders allow only one to cross it , to cross it , to cross their own varieties , and it does not immediately pronoun@@ ce them - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant pat@@ ron@@ age or prescribed . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; for the em@@ eri@@ ed professor of University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si @-@ board member Jack Klo@@ p@@ enburg are control of the seed and the ability to breed new plants , both for food safety and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to seeds , he plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to make the latter or not only a little by making seed with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ p@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not employed with genetically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented whether vegetables , cor@@ n , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; to buy our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agr@@ arian industry , as well as the recent examples the inter@@ positions of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Monsanto and Bayer , should also know that the manner is cultivated in August or September 2016 , should also know that the way of this vegetable is bred . &quot;
&quot; food sovereign without seed , is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative are committed to providing others with seeds , so that their approach is based on seeds and plant characteristics . &quot;
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supplies is endangered because of the available gen@@ pool due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore more and more restric@@ tive , inc@@ ess@@ antly shr@@ ink . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , Executive director of the Os@@ si , has engaged in her doctoral work with gene@@ tical variation of car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all cart@@ ot@@ ings are protected as intellectual property , whereby it is either not or only usable for plant breeding . &quot;
&quot; for other plants there are such estimates still not , but experts like Lu@@ by suspect that mass @-@ protected plants like wheat is patented in an even bigger style than salad or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of point of view
plants are so cultivated so that they have targeted features - of those who enhances their taste or colour up to such because they flour@@ ish in certain environments and to ste@@ al threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for bre@@ eder is decreasing by ever more patents . however , genetic diversity may be more inferior than ever before , since the changed conditions caused by climate change are far worse . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail Monsanto chiefs C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four comrades and cooperation with institutions such as the United State Department of the United States , the company is focusing on the preservation of genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradic@@ ts that intellectual property restric@@ ts other breeders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant @-@ related innovations . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically taken a plan that can be followed as soon as the patent is up . &quot;
often these instructions are helping others to come with another method for the same result .
such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovations but promotes them by providing the public with more material and know @-@ how .
&quot; Mor@@ ton sees this different : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ ire , is certainly no innovation . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait so long to breed on plants that have been adjusted to the changed environmental conditions , you have already lost the battle . &quot;
&quot; the main argument for Mor@@ ton is however , that genetic resources have always been a general public and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities and mon@@ e@@ inary incentives are not appealing to us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their job easier .
&quot; this is what motiv@@ ates us , and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es in the concept of itself , plant @-@ characteristics : &quot; we do not create the characteristics themselves . &quot;
the plants form them themselves and as breeders have finally no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ arol Dep@@ pe , Plant Bre@@ eding in the US @-@ State Oregon and Os@@ si @-@ board member , there is another important aspect of the plant breeding : &quot; who res@@ cu@@ es a variety , and his own values are breeding into them . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in the industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ ok@@ ul@@ tures , for whose cultivation , Her@@ bi@@ cides are needed , which breeding in his varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is precise . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that are moving on international markets , but smaller than Monsanto are ) patents , make it possible to survive most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either reject it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile , or both are the case . &quot;
the independent plant breeders Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for sal@@ ads in his breeding garden sal@@ ads .
photo by Karen Mor@@ ton .
&quot; Mor@@ ton is also the view that breeders by preventing the plant pat@@ ent@@ ent innovative would : &quot; it looks like I mean with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies , the pat@@ ernity . &quot;
&quot; I need constantly new material for my catalogue because I know that my competitor is selling my varieties in a couple of years ago , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent one is about 20 years ahead of competition , with what makes my opinion very pretty simple . &quot; &quot;
&quot; while the US seem to be leading in the &quot; open source &quot; breed , the concept now spreads rapidly around the world . &quot;
&quot; in India the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources , a &quot; open source &quot; seed program , the center with farmers working together and helps them to breed new grades to meet certain requirements . &quot;
&quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seeds , and to sell their own . &quot;
&quot; the German organisation Agre@@ ements is working on an &quot; open source &quot; license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , or because of the Os@@ si obligation cannot simply become one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive committee of the European Union , the European Commission , explains that conventional plants bred not pat@@ enting . thus , she speaks against the current practice of the European patent of patent , which is based on conven@@ tionally cultivated plants . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; it is now on the governments of the Member States to implement the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organised a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seeds and seed companies from all East Africa to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems explains that the organization currently stands out a worldwide alliance of &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , which will be the official launch next year . &quot;
&quot; a consortium of environmental protection and development aid groups ( among them hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development organization US@@ C Canada and the action group at ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database to seeds , technology and con@@ centr@@ ation ) to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global Alliance for the future of Food - a composite of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - published a report . in this they represent the opportunity that farmers have the opportunity to improve and improve the seed policy , so that a stable supply of food can be ensured . &quot;
&quot; in the report also emphasized the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection , by the Lu@@ by of Os@@ si hopes to see him soon more people . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food mainly took care of where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , so Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the newest objectives of the cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still unlock content on the Internet .
this time it hit the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ nis@@ ts .
&quot; on the weekend of the 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government conducted the website of the S@@ Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; on Facebook , the network released a statement on Facebook in which it critici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step sharply and promised to continue working and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the S@@ Network for Human Rights information remains intact despite this attack and the rejection of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities , to un@@ cover the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it was never that important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirmed that all technical possibilities should be exhausted , so that all technical possibilities had been exhausted , so that it has never been so difficult to overcome these goals . we insist on continuing our task further . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is regarded as the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked out 21 websites before more than two months , including the independent news page M@@ AD@@ A Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ speaking network of Al Jazeera due to alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of the site barrier to the victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main data sources of human rights in Arabic . htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
besides AN@@ HR@@ I also exists on the blog of the colum@@ nis@@ ts and human rights research Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no access in Egypt .
&quot; Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of articles and articles , which he has not written in Egypt , not accessible websites and media . &quot;
&quot; now the blog , which he set up to circum@@ navigate the cens@@ ored apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ g@@ gers , who is home in the Chinese blog , on the other hand , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent almost 500 days in captivity until he was arrested by Egyptian security forces during December 2013 and recorded a video like the police force of physical violence against two students . &quot;
his article revol@@ ve mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook commentary , Zi@@ ada spoke about the block by the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; the , blogs to lock is very old , but has in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fatal al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the block@@ age of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is however for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has been able to convey to me the feeling of an ins@@ ag@@ ment ; a arrest , a attempted murder , un@@ loading of the National Security Council , the blocking blogs as well as any other website , for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I was not in vain . in other words , my words have an influence , even if only on a small audience . &quot;
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to the post of articles to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; but now , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the mu@@ te go the way up to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Thou@@ ght and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from May 24 to 06 . August 133 web pages . this erg@@ ing technical tests in the networks of different Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE documented also the blocking of vendors , which was possible through the circum@@ vention of era en@@ sur and Private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12th we noticed how the blocking of web pages , the V@@ P@@ N@@ s began . &quot;
&quot; such a practice refers to the intention of the government to block and filter content , on which Egyptian users could have access . &quot;
&quot; the situation will additionally ag@@ grav@@ ated that the cens@@ ored decisions are made behind closed doors , thereby causing the Egyptian population to deal with no legal basis , with which they can proceed to judgment against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants are fighting .

&quot; day by day reports newspapers in Brazil with d@@ wind@@ ling headlines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of many postcard motives . &quot;
some of these lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; every second day a police officers were murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Die@@ be rus@@ hing pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and Air Force to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation , the violence in 2017 reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian government of Global Justice even called for the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; for detailed reporting about violence in Rio @-@ known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on 16 August the editorial &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; in which they announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city will now be published there .
the motives for their decision declared the newspaper as follows :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in any major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ bery , sex break , etc . everything , however , is published by the civili@@ zed standard and what is only in Rio will be published in the column &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; ( ... ) This is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes before cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , that this decision is not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize war at all .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper stated that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas , that are controlled by criminal organizations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the newspaper writes on : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war course , if he is distorted , also to be used , cru@@ el@@ ties of the police , which only sho@@ ots and then ask questions to im@@ itate . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners . &quot;
unlock the term &quot; war &quot; more than they are useful ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasi@@ l , the journalist of Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , consider the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this was in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to account the responsibility of the police . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of the military personnel in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and historical and self @-@ suffici@@ ency of public service . &quot;
to remember : the State of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

&quot; for these security measures , the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the federal state Rio in the year 2003 , whose objective is to conquer an Fav@@ ela by employing a massive police offer to capture Fav@@ ela and make unity permanently there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . for a few years , U@@ PP has led the U@@ PP after several reports on Shi@@ ps and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor con@@ gregations , which should actually protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under fire . &quot;
&quot; on his fac@@ ebook @-@ site , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux made from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for people . &quot;
&quot; for this calls on the state to use funds and ways which are typical of a war . this belongs to the penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; which is an un@@ sharp point in the countryside and to the object for &quot; col@@ lateral damages &quot; and &quot; ir@@ ref@@ ated balls . &quot; &quot;

to stay alive : besi@@ eged Syrians learn to plant mushrooms
scre@@ enshot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 , and in the following civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly through the Assad regime to loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victory Worldwatch , a joint initiative of the peace organization Pa@@ x and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently around a million Syrians in a state of siege . &quot;
&quot; the East G@@ hou@@ ta region is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded the life of Hunder@@ tw@@ asser . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition go out , based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations , that the massacre was practi@@ sed by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these were controlled areas outside of Damascus under siege , which resulted in local residents and reli@@ ed by tunnel and control points by tunnel and control points . &quot;
&quot; due to the years of block@@ age , traditional food such as meat has become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter @-@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academics , the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ ta , as they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ ni@@ da and run the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to the conventional , planted foods planted in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , it makes it an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the besi@@ eged East G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the Direc@@ tion of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we chose to cultivation of mushrooms because they have high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because you can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organis@@ ers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to announce this project and sup@@ pressed its relief that it wins now more and more . &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , take advantage in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ ni@@ da the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge to planting mushrooms , such as Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12.@@ 700 , but will continue to collect donations from Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is dependent on alternat@@ ors , which hold the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % . &quot;
&quot; because of the fuel @-@ scar@@ city , locally produced drivers from plastic are used to supply alternat@@ ors with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , that they started producing &quot; fung@@ al &quot; &quot; production from the regions before they check their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
subsequently they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when this managed they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; since the start of the project and after three months , they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East G@@ hou@@ ta free of charge . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la stated that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; we want to bring people to the mushroom breeding of different reasons &quot; : break in siege .
providing a new source of food on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using vineg@@ ar ( like paper , tea , coffee set , cardboard , etc ) to obtain new foods . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs , especially for women , who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound to their home .
&quot; he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea all over the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege is visible . &quot;
we want our experience to be inspired in crisis @-@ areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese for justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
&quot; several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many district districts in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of fires , who run in the north of Portugal at the north of Portugal . &quot;
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured due to the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government called last week from solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state shower .
fires were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain where there were 4 dead .
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire@@ ps , spread across the north and centrally located regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , there was a similar tragedy in Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande where there were 64 deaths of deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European fores@@ try system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite images , are burned in Portugal about 500,000 hectares of forest - an area of the size of the district Lisbon . &quot;
so that you can get a better picture from the seriousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
&quot; Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) 15 October , 2017 &quot;

numerous videos spread out on the web and show images that allow better insights into the events :
the predictable tragedy ...
the aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better prev@@ ent@@ ative and fire @-@ fighting measures by the state .
people asked why civil protection was not able to reach the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
João Sover@@ al by the Con@@ federation of the farmers of Portugal explained the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; after Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
&quot; this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are dozens of open roads , which were surrounded by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened again as in June , since the streets were very late . &quot;
&quot; in addition , construction permits in eco @-@ abilities are questioned with high fire risk . &quot;
&quot; an extensive proposal to the Wal@@ dre@@ form , which the government had earned after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the commun@@ es who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the construction of case to case if the applicant was made about funds for self @-@ protection , that was an open back@@ door so that everything could be built , &quot; manages João Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us made aware that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of slightly burning wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , according to fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; these problems occur to the fact that the civil protection website from Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as resident information requested or tried to contact relatives , was offline . &quot;
&quot; it was a private initiative , which provided the people with information supplied : they used their own civil protection data using the application fo@@ os@@ .@@ pt , and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires . &quot;
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer João P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of fire bri@@ ga@@ des , and was subsequently adopted on this f@@ ateful weekend in October so that the servers followed the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires , did not count the website more than half a million access . &quot;

in the dawn the boy should break up .

those who have known for their hatred on the Haz@@ ara @-@ known Taliban always came closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
he worked for a couple of years in a coal pit . the work was heavy and made him ill .
&quot; then he took what was left of his wages , and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and to@@ wed bags with mor@@ tar , the he@@ avier than he himself , in order to earn a living . &quot;
back then as today the life of Afgh@@ an refugees was marked by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , it rec@@ alled A@@ shar@@ k in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on site on which we worked . &quot;
there was no services there and no heating . we left n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we were not frozen overnight at night .
&quot; after four years A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran , and made ready for travel to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous crossing of the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and stran@@ gen@@ dered on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ k came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time was A@@ shar@@ af ob@@ tainable , walked alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church who shared twice the day food for needy persons . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for exp@@ ired asylum seekers , but it is true also that the conditions that asylum seekers in the country can be cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
the Civil Rights Organization for Europe writes the system &quot; suffers under a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the large majority of the asylum seekers is accommodated in more than 3000 &quot; special reception centers . &quot; this is impro@@ vised , in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only be assigned to a recording centre when they officially submitted an application for asylum - which can be drawn after the registration of the asylum request . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation , either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the road . &quot;
so it was also A@@ shar@@ k .
but his un@@ du@@ ous lifestyle helped A@@ shar@@ k to free himself from these conditions .
&quot; after having done several years working in construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af ob@@ serves his entire savings in the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this ran so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a Schn@@ el@@ lim@@ p opened .
A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ atis success story is now the subject of documentation &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; in 2017 , the film received the Venice City Award , which has been awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially non @-@ Italians - are very difficult .
&quot; a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to in@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years some of the Afgh@@ ans company were created , including cutting , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some af@@ gh@@ ani restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea to his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the restaurant &apos;s menu tells by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their journey to Italy . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ k &apos;s goals are far beyond the Italian Ga@@ stronom@@ y shop and the retail , and aim back to the country that he had to leave behind as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I never forget my country and I can &apos;t live happily if I know that my people suffer .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af ob@@ serves plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; so they can sell their seriousness in the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of successful entrepreneurs was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there is stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ k has made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afghanistan on this path .
&quot; ninth report : legislative acts from Egypt enable shut@@ down from social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , since more than 900 days in prison . &quot;
&quot; he reported on the clearance of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;
photo of @ Cil@@ un@@ a@@ 27 shared on Twitter .
&quot; global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen &apos;s report is an international snapshot , the challenges , victories and emerging trends in global interactions . &quot;
&quot; the Egyptian Parliament has reviewed the draft law , which shows that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration at a government agency . &quot;
&quot; users would need to be able to use the social networks within six months after successful legislation , indicating their full name as well as their reference number . &quot;
those who miss this step could be sentenced to up to six months of prison or the withdrawal of criminal payment .
&quot; the law , which was applied by sixty parliament@@ arians , is currently under legislative as well as the constitutional committee of the Parliament and should be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; a further Parliament adopted a legislative proposal to be introduced into the tougher sanctions for the President , or by a high officials . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law the insul@@ ting of the President as well as the state institutions are already pun@@ is@@ hable . however , under the proposal of the law , such an act would be punished with prison and monetary policy , so right wing the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be adopted , this can mean up to three years in prison for the settlement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would be a political climate where the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) which was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he demonstrated violence against demonstrators , who demonstrated against military coup which led to the minister of elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting as more than 700 protest who have been arrested in the same incident , four years in detention on a trial date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postponed to 20 May because the prison line according to human rights groups was dict@@ ated by the def@@ endants in the cour@@ tro@@ om . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threatens the death penalty based on one , so many human rights groups agree that the exposure of other weapons of weapons , illegal assembly , murder and trying murder . &quot;
in another case a criminal tribunal in G@@ iza spoke the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were indicted for their coverage to the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya place in Cairo .
&quot; the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly who were also arrested in the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunisian activists to sc@@ anned documents
&quot; may , Tunisian authorities six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was primarily attributed to a scrut@@ iny action plan . bes@@ po@@ ised plan dates back to the President of the Republic , who according to the plan explicitly support a controversial law by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali the corruption of the Official Am@@ nesty Am@@ nesty , provided that these all un@@ lawful stock@@ holders returned . &quot;
&quot; the document published on 21 April on the site of Na@@ wa@@ at &apos;s website , sheds light on how the pre@@ emin@@ ent plans for the support of the legislative system look like . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused to disclosure its sources by stating Article 11 of the Tunisian press , which journalists have the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he joined the district court in Tunis on 09 . may as a witness in the event . &quot;
will China force the users of social media to present their ID ?
&quot; according to new regulations of the information office of the State of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media need permission to write or share messages in social media . &quot;
&quot; in addition , registration with the full real name will also be stated . &quot;
analy@@ st suspect that this should be achieved by the elimination of anonymous comments in discussions within social networks . it is still unclear how the authorities use these regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese network citizens have suggested in the social media using these regulations only to protect citizens journalism and its independence . &quot;
then see you in &quot; We@@ chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may lock up the state cens@@ orship in Russia access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ chat .
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ chat , to register at the State Government as the &quot; organizer of the Information &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this name is part of a law dating from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian Government will organise a list of online services , which allows the &quot; publication of the information to be responsible for removing content and force them upon request for viewing user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites are currently under web sites such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ vi@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and d@@ utz@@ lig@@ ation of other services . &quot;
Turkish Court has free@@ ware Wikipedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court ordered the blocking Wikipedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators have refused to delete two English @-@ speaking articles , the information that Turkey support the jihadists in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry for Transport , maritime affairs and communication had been blocked , the site has been blocked because they work on &quot; a source of information that co @-@ act with groups in order to provide a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey &apos;s website is completely blocked . it is therefore , apart from among other things China , one of the few countries worldwide where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain can not stop getting around .
&quot; after this week , the United Kingdom &apos;s Government is situated in the middle of a targeted consultation with regard to increased monitoring powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communication in real time and install Back@@ door programs . &quot;
&quot; the government has cons@@ ented of telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , however , has taken other technology companies and the civilian population . &quot;
&quot; despite all of this , the consultation will continue until the 19th of May . reactions and proposals by the members of the public can be passed on to the Interior Ministry . &quot;
