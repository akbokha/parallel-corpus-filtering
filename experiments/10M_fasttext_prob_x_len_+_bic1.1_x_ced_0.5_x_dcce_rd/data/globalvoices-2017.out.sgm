<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation I have grown up with American movies, danced to American music, American writers and practiced his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as an 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as the Jura-president, who was the Supreme Court with judges who were tilted to his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to Method Man," I was "s as if that is the absolute truth, forgot everything else that is what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, had even strengthened my admiration for the US."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you are always that you are and it's easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very strange love letter written about its size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he is moving with a narrow-face.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain with his opinion as one says so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks of how a former colleague put it, and explained publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroUS and Women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted for him in shear."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes, which he won during the republican elections, was the highest number that has ever achieved by the party Candidate candidate."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans, who support this bigotte person, asked me?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I was able to trace Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"as for example my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalist's program, the people from all over the world participates, a deep natural person with whom I was talking about Islam and its past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the mist worldview not coincided with the name of Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer "." "</seg>
<seg id="24">"Bhatia and I met our joint love for basketball, and we spent many hours to watch the" Phoenix Suns "at the game."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps Intolerant is also in contrast to generosity that I experienced in Sandy, who fights their lives long the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me as their son."</seg>
<seg id="26">She also adapts to the commitment of Kristi Kappes who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise counsel helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them are deepening my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump finds its way to nominees republican Presidential candidates, she offered me a grip and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly White, the Presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt for non-white men."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people have voted for Trump because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, broke me almost the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Maybe it is unfair to designate the Trump-voters as seists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to arrange people, one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">"this is superficial and respectful, and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way."</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears are not taken into account about the hectic changes in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters are, of whom most knows, for trump, because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might want to say that in this America they are still important?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick that commentated the cruel decision to rise up a man who looks down with contempt for those who look different than him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" "Whitelash" "(Ankm.).: as much as" "drawing up the whites against all other ethnicities"; "foreplay from white in suits on the White and whiplash, which means as much as slingdertrauma) as it did the great Van Jones, has made exactly what America has done so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background you may have always, America welcomes everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the election of Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of the white America that promise this promise and says: to Hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America to 9 / 11 the white man is back on the ruin, say it."</seg>
<seg id="46">"with all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who had fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">On a manifestation of Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a change of change with the crowd of men.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have been my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd answered with a onomic" "No!" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" "brood the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" "answered them."</seg>
<seg id="54">Did Afro-Americans have a place in your America?</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" wars, they and their voices were louder. "</seg>
<seg id="56">Would anyone who is not like you to have a place in your America?</seg>
<seg id="57">"he received a unanimous and onomatted" "NO" "!"</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" "thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America." "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son had fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps," the message said. "</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America."</seg>
<seg id="62">And this breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="70">"the music that is played in both places is not only the life of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a big garbage dump; only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is popular among tourists -but worlds from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">"for some years now, La Banda de Música (Music Association) has been playing a symphony orchestra in the municipality: one of children and adults with the existing Symphony Orchestra, which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drugs abuse and gangs."</seg>
<seg id="77">"but after a random encounter with a French pilot, who started a musical project and the youth began such a rare hopelessness."</seg>
<seg id="78">The young bandmembers take their commitments to the music group very seriously - writes local press notcias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">"once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to go to their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"they always come and play with shiny eyes and play in the Trubel you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, flute, forest horn, flocks, Bongo and the Conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from the rubbish</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateaura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments that are made of reinfordable waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with re-prepared instruments made from local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateaura, where the recycling led by Favio Chávez have begun to transform parts of the waste in instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"the instruments imitate Got, viola, Celli, double basses, guitars, flutes, trumpets, trumpets and percussion, which were all made out of the trash."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, of Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article of Los Angeles Times Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and musician instructor for the children of Cateaura, at the beginning of the time:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first, it was very difficult because we had no space for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the rubbish. children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact parents, because many of them do not live with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something that he had never seen before: one from waste-made violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments from re-prepared material and that The recycled Orchestra is called."</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing is fighting.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this article, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports international, practical solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">Republication happens within the scope of an agreement with Global Voices for shared usage of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa was then known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing, before it was looking for the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">"the East African countries had therefore killed and little inclined to welcome a brewing of these kind at its coasts."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized themselves up against the ship. they refused to place one of their harbours and refused to give him a fishing pack."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" suddenly, the Prime Minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused everything, "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a deputy of the Kenyan fisheries authority. he is part of a team that discovered the ship at the time and followed."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of plundering of fish stocks of the country."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, criminal practices crossed and protecting resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegal Fishing (Illegal fisheries)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that had expelled the Premier from their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" we have eight countries who are like coined and working together. they exchange information and stand each other when it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending illegally Fishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definition unregulated: what is captured is hidden because it is extremely difficult to trace. thus the illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">"by the intentional contempt of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystem can harm the illegal fishing ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while action against illegal fishing were once handicapped by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snails, the actions occurred today in real time, with traceable at FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, the individual countries can exchange other lists of existing licenses, news for suspicious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port review."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive, when they move on the open sea, via satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this makes it possible to identify the authorities, ships which fish in boted areas - such as such that indicate that a ship loads his captured fish on the road to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence where they were travelling and possibly also if they have a penny."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries who are against illegal fishing can deny the adoption of such vessels in their ports. what does the ships do not sell their cargo. and that they could even be forced to penalties for penalties, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is then about considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, manager Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a counselling company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the aforementioned platform has been created to gain estimated 20 million USD in lost turnover, which will lose eight members of the Network HISH-i every year because of the illegal fishermen who penetrate into East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish farms that attracts commercial fishing from around the world. this also includes these illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include actions like the sailing under false flag, counterfeit licences, stating by fantasies, the fish protected species and the fish in nature conservation areas."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they targeted the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non-complete control system", "says Long." "in the past a ship could not fish illegally and a country could then say" You can't stop my harbour. "</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'come to me'. 'and just this legale lophole tries to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception was FISH-i involved in more than 30 investigations of suspects ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has uncovered criminal networks, distributed counterfeit licences in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has startled ships to be followed and found."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the International Authority to combat crimes, FISH-i can share information about illegal fishing through large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us pretty much into the networks organized crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that is to help the FISH-i-suspects ships more precise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with kind permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which will always be further developed, also helps to trace the illegal ships that likes to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position. and that we try to cross, "" says Duncan Copeland, Chefanalyst at Trygg Mat tracking, an NGO who also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships turn off for example, their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be Georgian."</seg>
<seg id="135">"Copeland helps to build a system that combines various information levels with each other. it aims to help FISH-i to find criminally active ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform for Global Fishing Watch with Google and the Sea protection Organisation Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and by means of which the position of every single traceable ship can be displayed worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" gather together with neighbours to get a better picture of what is doing - this simply meaning "," he says. "" here is a chance for countries to unite and gather their resources to investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global level." "Pew Charitable trusts has a similar project to run, in which a global system allows the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities not only feel crime, but they are also deterred."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships, formerly unexploited and hardly to reckon with consequences, know now that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating at FISH-i have since increased a 33% increase in fishing sales, since fishing boats more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia, Greko 1 had set up, the inspectors found there on board tow networks, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with kind permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars disappear through illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"there are six countries joined together in 2015, so called West Africa Task Force. now they are fighting illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH." "With safety, the goal is to develop even more such initiatives and structures also in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently FISH-i's youngest member country of Somalia was able to report his first major triumph: in October there was Greko 1, a ship which was on the wrong flag, and not only was the ship without a license and were hauled tuppnets, which are now prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also penetrated in the botanic waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the taking of action against Greko 1 they set a strong sign that it will proceed against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a special, collaborative effort to protect the oceans actually works. Emma Bryce is free professional journalist and lives in London. there, she writes on the subject of environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>
<seg id="152">"their articles appear in the Wired Magazine, TED Education, the New York Times and The Guardian. location in Venezuela is more pointed to: demonstrations in several cities with the aim of recapture the country"</seg>
<seg id="153">The movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations.</seg>

<seg id="359">"we are sincere, that older people felt by insufficient correction (the translation) of our part," said the Police. "</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News took a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" terribly "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police the share of older drivers, the country is still involved in accidents, but quite some occasion for concern."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in Kyoto, for instance, 1.941 of a total of 19.460 ounces of seniors have been caused by seniors in 2005. this represents a share of 10%."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to survive, one needs two important abilities: passive language skills to understand the output text and active language skills to transfer him to the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that is the case in parent's language. in general, the conviction that translators in the target language - should not be in the initial language - maternity language."</seg>
<seg id="379">"thus, a French mother language would translate into French for example from English to French - not from French to English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as a mother tongue, which might produce translations into English. this may result in misunderstanding of the superiority, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers, the Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies that do not have foreign employees themselves, translations nevertheless make firing internally. then, the Japanese employee, whose English skills are considered to be the best - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Mechanical translations are also widely used - often with fun results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the distressed and puzzling sentences, which arise by mechanical translations, show that this technique can be replaced by no human translator for a long time. this is particularly true for some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strange English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling prints, often used T-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr-User Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors like jewelry is still acceptable or at least harmless. but by large companies or from the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations."</seg>
<seg id="389">The Kyoto city will hopefully use a reputable source of its translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian MPs recently agreed to a draft law on "regulations regarding the use and utility of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"when it is accepted by the Parliament, users and users of social media have to register in Egypt at a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, a place would be set up, which is in order to give citizens a permission to give social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months of acceptance of the law, users and users had to register with their right names and personnel numbers to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"will it be dreaming of doing this, so that a punishment of up to six months might be in prison or a bucket with themselves."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill that consists of six paragpunish and used in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" any use that runs through the Internet and used to communicate with others through voice, video, and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is not clear how the law will be enforced when the draft does not apply, as Egyptian authorities want to impose on how Egyptian authorities do not register for the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, parliamentarians and promoters of the legislative situation, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a username and a password to get through the firewall, the Facebook blocks."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt is planning to judge a firewall at the national level around Facebook. due to which it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information to their identity, to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">Yet it is not known so far that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts in the field are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German" conductive research ") of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German" Egyptian Initiative for personal rights "), told Global Voices:"</seg>
<seg id="514">I even doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they make it possible that just as they have raped physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"when I take them seriously, then this means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who request a permit or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring it to a trial process."</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the legislative process and the constitutional committees before it enters the debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether its acceptance and enforcement is successful or not, the draft is consistent with a pro-military mindset in the parliament, in whose sense the control is maximized and it should be assured that no deviation Narration is present on the picture surface," says Raoof. "</seg>

<seg id="544">"in early March 2017, documented the daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, made the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those who had been triggered by the" triple catastrophe "of March 2011. a violent earthquake, a tsunami and a atom accident in Fukushima had triggered the disaster."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi Prefecture was a prefecture of prefecture in Japan northeast, which both experienced the earthquake and the resulting tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">"hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring prefecture of Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, because the tsunami had disappear whole coastal cities from the map."</seg>
<seg id="547">"in addition, Fukushima the prefecture of Fukushima still experienced a nuclear accident. therefore, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses."</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of Kahoku Shimpo shows the progress made six years later in order to re-establish the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the paper includes both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of those affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that as far as December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts (about, about,, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefecture of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate."</seg>
<seg id="552">"the biggest success among the three prefectures have recorded Miyagi, here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima forms the final light against Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="554">"however, one always tries to move again six years after the catastrophe, evacuated from Behelfswald (Sell, Kazetsu juutaku) into final spare parts."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in containers shelters."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016, 36 000 people lived from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such containers."</seg>
<seg id="557">"almost 40 percent of 2011 evacuated from Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi had more successful than 75 per cent of the evacuation that has been hauled after disaster in housing shelters."</seg>
<seg id="558">"for Iwate, the number is here by 34 per cent."</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="560">"how the Kahoku Shimpo-newspaper was able to find out, 1074 of 1100 schools who were affected by the disaster, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">"six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures are much more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="562">"while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing vessels in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, in Fukushima only 30 percent of the fishing cities have resumed their operation."</seg>
<seg id="563">"the tsunami and the atomic accident, have drawn large-scale in the three prefectures of agricultural land."</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of arable land in Iwate and less than 50 per cent of arable land in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of nuclear energy, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed agricultural land of Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures of tourism, tourism has once again recovered, but again Fukushima still remains downbeat."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again at 90 percent of the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, however, can only be 75 percent here."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coast-inhabitants, it's more difficult to experience their living."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"to determine a full picture, the newspaper conducted numerous surveys under the local population and under the evacuation by the evacuation. she asked them about the status of rebuilding and also, as did their receptor to the tsunami risk."</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey in order to find out more about the tsunami awareness among the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">"the survey brought that 83.1 per cent of local residents, measures have taken to be prepared for future earthquake and tsunamis."</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough in terms of disaster prevention has been done."</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to evacuated the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in her issue to the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has strengthened its attention also to the situation of the evacuated from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had not only had to experience the tremendous earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also witness of the worst, disastrous, atomic accident that ever had to experience in Japan."</seg>
<seg id="578">"of 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016 a little more than 23 000 people had been converted back to Fukushima, in permanent spare parts."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after 2017, there are still 40 000 inhabitants from Fukushima outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"most of the evacuation areas are most of the evacuation, which still have to compete in containers shelters, over 50 years old. they have to compete for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects. this is building projects that are part of the Olympic Games that are part of the Olympic Games."</seg>

<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were placed in the sugar mills.</seg>
<seg id="629">"the sugars in the region stands still, and the factory lost after and after its installations, until only the rumst of steel and concrete remained."</seg>
<seg id="630">Approximately 272 workers had to reinvent itself.</seg>

<seg id="639">"the news would have been a motive for alarm for the country a couple of decades ago, but the bad ones have already no more news."</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar industry turned out?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railroads of the church saw already better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">"the reduction in the sugar industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar mills were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they were intolerable for the land."</seg>
<seg id="644">"the initial idea was to focus the production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories that can produce sugar for maximum 4 Centavos (0.03 euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar plantations and the sugars in the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">"nevertheless, the sugars increased from around a decade ago."</seg>
<seg id="649">"from 2017 to 2025 the price of unrefined sugar between 15 and 16 Centavos will remain per pound, according to 2016 report" "agricultural perspectives" "by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations and Food Organisation of the United Nations."</seg>

<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state."</seg>

<seg id="719">"to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, are displayed near the entrance gate (the one," "Plastic models of the dishes" ") of each food that is served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers see these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">"there is a whole industry, dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes."</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the shortcut district of Kappabashi, there are a multitude of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes, which was documented by the German filmmakers Wim Wender in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so usual that they don't even change them anymore. however, a new trend turns them into conspicuous cell accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">"at Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published series of social media links and photos, which show this unusual twist to the shook."</seg>

<seg id="729">"in this case, there was a cave-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) turned into a mobile-handed."</seg>
<seg id="730">For these triangular bowl (lol) we have found a good use as a mobile phone.</seg>

<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing excursion into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some mobile-phones and mobile designers allow you to manufacture your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon-oestrogen is used, a popular place that is served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"is there anyone who would say:" wow, cool, now I can fix my mobile phone with salmon-oestrogen? "</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will probably be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic might also be a less appetizing form, to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile-watch has the form of melted ice.</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous" fight against drug trafficking "in Mexico, the suspicious and gearboxes regularly dive into statistics. however, these reflect not the extent of the human tragedy which this struggle brings."</seg>
<seg id="750">"the coverage of drug bosses like El Chapo Guzmán, the head of the Sinaloa-carton, thrust the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, someone looks at the bereaved or the congregations who have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"there are behind any glue, behind each bone fund in the hundreds of heated tombs, the stories paid by parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds might never cure."</seg>
<seg id="753">"therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal Político began to learn the digital project" Aprender a Vivir El Narco "(German:" "with the drug trafficking"), which is said to give this sacrifice a voice and told stories of people who came into the struggle between law enforcement authorities and cartels. "</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime can not only be afraid of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, when shops close, because they are threatened by drug dealers and so many churches need to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video entitled "Vidas que cambian por el miedo" (German: "how fear life changes") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father, who is seeking every weekend secret tombs after his son."</seg>
<seg id="761">"Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father to only one day, her four brethren, her husband and two of her nephew."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priest:" "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task that we have placed ourselves, go and go to graves, according to the people we loved."</seg>

<seg id="771">"you are the insurance of my Father's insurance, but who doesn't get them out, because a sterilization demand."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get that? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we do not only show the faces of those who face fear. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the government."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some extracts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a lesbian of Animal Político, wrote this article from Taxco, the State of Guerrero in Central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"your contribution reminds us that violence should never consider as normal, regardless of what type it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I've been familiar with disease and Sensational journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come by newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with pictures that actually only come from a textbook for criminology or from experts.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">"sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who has disgusted or sad. it works, like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body."</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider it to be normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She is continuing to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10 year old cousin thinks that he is great. and it is also not normal that people will hear songs about the" heroism "of the offenders, if they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me this is, as if they have suffered those who have lost someone, and those who have fear that something happened to them too."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories are going to mere numbers in statistics.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the insomnia of the people is incredible for me, if the death of six people and the extravagant can be justified by 43 students in a neighboring village so that they were" "relässig." ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to talk that they remain spared by such tragedies if they are not stirring and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico-Stadt wrote the contribution" four months blackmail in the main city district: how a family with threats dropped out. in this, it describes how an armed criminal month was pressed for money from their business until they ended up not only the business, but also their families apart.

<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, because you do not know when they will deceived or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I asked myself these terrible days if wines would resolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answers is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega released the post "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence signed."</seg>
<seg id="800">"in the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man, who was murdered by organised crime?"</seg>
<seg id="801">What is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexicos?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a guard and he tells you to teach himself how to cook a egg, potatoes, tortillas warm and 'Chichi' for the babies which live with it. this is his name for the preparation of the surface with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">"but they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes, unspeakably for a boy for whom all life made of violence and who had to learn to live with it."</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But that was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was past two years before, when he saw only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody body of his father had been shot by the armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"when Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence organized by organised crime and fighting against the existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez, Juárez, was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of killings based on public safety and government of the Government of the United States."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010, the Public Prosecutor's Office was 3103 Morde. this is equivalent to 8.5 Morden per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands who organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories continue to live in the face of ever new lines. but this project reminds us of those that we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco ", Animal Político presents its objective to present complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trading, which has tormented the country in the last four decades, in an intelligible way."</seg>

<seg id="1209">"Bassel could not know then that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put it all about it, this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens, but of the world."</seg>

<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to technology. he taught me to use both computers and smart phones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he has also taught other prisoners, as they may use computers, at least theoretically, without that they actually stopped one in their hands."</seg>

<seg id="1256">"this is diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment with four other defendants due to the imparation of 54 million Metikal (approximately 800 000 Euros)."</seg>

<seg id="1259">"in accordance with an opinion of the general public-country relationship of the Republic, which claimed the request, there would be no obstacles to Cambaza to resume its old post as the company was not a disciplining process after his detention."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many people don't know the action well."</seg>

<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net, because they reveal the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East-Indian origin or generally used as an adjective."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or the" "Kalar" "or the way of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalistic movements has given the word an extremely remote connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar'may be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically arise from hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts, in which they have reviewed the use of the word or have doubts about his use."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"furthermore, there are several burmesian words with fundamental meanings, which have the same letter as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair is written on Burmically also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar Pae' (Spage), 'Kalar oat' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">"the Facebooker Aung Kaat Myat declared the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar', saying,"</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post by one of my friends was deleted today because it contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends on a spiritual way whether they knew how he could alleviate his back pain by doing a word."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the sentence ku la -" "healing" "(la) + the Frageword (la) at Burmesan - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"in Win, the opinion that it will reduce hate-speaking national nationalists, however, stressed that Facebook must be analytic before reaching all pods that are in suspicion, racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write on facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to analyse the post carefully and control it by checking the following words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example," "Kalar Htine" "(chair) and" "Kalar Pae" "(age-age)."</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that this dreckery nationalists, who spread hate speech, a pretty good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action likes to send a strong signal to anyone who spread hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the word word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his Posts as he only wanted to inform his friends, that the word 'Kalar' is banished from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I was attentive to this new directive of Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>

<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"moreover, it appears as if they started without local context or technical support and have banned words like" "chair" "or" "inheritance curry". ""</seg>

<seg id="1480">It reports on how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and they simultaneously have made it to ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini was in its discussion, acted by women who did not name their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which the women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"to pronounce the name of their husbands, a Brother is not guilty to all of its sponsors, and have never questioned it."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini writes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testified that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who does not hold this, is seen as a pencil, as a woman without morals."</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never done thought to this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband on behalf of so far, try to try out at home as it runs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion on her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>

<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband shaved for a long time after the video was finished.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should call him from now on at his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage of Rohini started its first discussion board.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" "Patriarchate" "never before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to move the discussion with a practice."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked all," If we cannot say the name of our husbands, but they can name us as they want, means that they do not respect us? "</seg>

<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which they brought the name of their husbands to the lips," "says Rohini Paine in Maharashtra over the breaking of a centuries-old tradition, in which women married the name of their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she had only kicked off during the whole exercise; another chose to let all the bothering frustration against him and his family by killing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ekstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"even in adrenalin rush about it, with an ancient Brush broken, the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to name their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days it received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put on women in the head: his wife could not stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the entire family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law she moved, she got afraid and said that it was an error."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," Rohini said, I should do it. "</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in was less understanding and the situation arised in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the cinoma point on the forehead, which indicates the Ehestatus:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why must only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would carry out the cinoma red point if he was doing it too."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I listened to him to bear him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not stopped fully with it, but they think they are now in a better position to choose himself, not to wear it in some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we are making a trip at each discussion."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want the women to worry about who could hear," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="1522">During the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and gentle and spoke about things about which they never had thought of.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have made some things, for example, like our identities to our husbands, never said honestly."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to say certain things loud, no matter how small they happen."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most it is okay, but some wanted a sage-spa, a wide shirt of a pants, wear; they have not dared."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much argument and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes, morality joined together with the Saris and much more, jewellery Rohini her own couple Kurta (Oberhemmed) into a discussion, so that the women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is certain that they will create it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"the question arises whether in the five months since their first discussion, Rohini confirms that things are slowly coming into roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then listened again to the name of their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, make it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved."</seg>
<seg id="1535">"just one or two continue to say the name of their husbands. only one or two women are now wearing Zinnoberrot, at any time."</seg>
<seg id="1536">"the women in the discussion, know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the polish for more freedom of movement or their own garment - at the end of a difficult to navigating river."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving up mutual confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Every one of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman in the club is home and other people reported what we talk and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories about which it is not reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"these stories are" news of those who are experiencing themselves "" and offer a hyperlocal context to report on global human rights and development challenges. "</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice, Shanmugam should be regarded as a city in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This statement triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting at the meeting of the international branch of the Lawyers of the State of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because it was compared to Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He support Singapore to be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Minister," "turning the logic to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifice, to create this valuable country, we say that we are not a country in the end."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a mandatory injury."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my land, Whose land is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons for Shanmugat were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries, in view of which it appeared inevitably undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"in contrast, he defends the idea that Singapore with cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York should be compared, equally cities that are permanently managed by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as one reaches the core of the theme, the good old body of the authoritarian rulers appear to be the predominant logic, as it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"during the last week of Shanmugam, the answers to his American guests were given to us regarding our press, our predictive, our political system really non-answers."</seg>
<seg id="1703">Corresponding questions tared with non-answers irrational way.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to make his opinion clear as it did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city is, for which country belongs to our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I understand nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our more K Shanmugam took the effort to take this point unless he was paid high, in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by posting on the blog his comment, he points to the critics that you should begin to read the entire collaboration of the conference so that you can see the context of the statements of Shanmugam better, according to which Singapore was a city and no country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the inscription.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"he said that Singapore was rather a" "city" "as a country," he explained why the elections in Singapore be so unequal, even if we enjoy free and just elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">"he lived Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?)."</seg>
<seg id="1713">"he said, Singapore" "be no country", "he obviously does not mean it in that sense!"</seg>

<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, Member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes that he really is associated with what he defends."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review breaks the weaknesses of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Mr. Shanmugam" "believed a mistake" "or was it a Freudendspeaker?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we only regarded as independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, on which country go back to the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">"Singapore is unique, it is both land and city."</seg>
<seg id="1723">"as he plays an important role within the government, the statements by Mr Shanmugam are of serious importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the husks consider their military service, they only defend their city but do not their country?"</seg>

<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink human resource?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"add the Journey of a Decade to Beyahung, Singapore and was always a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I have not said, what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This phrase seems to have become annoyed in many ways...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever told that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements like" the defense of the country, above all "etc." but that is not quite true. "</seg>

<seg id="1745">"on my clarinet usually follows the default answer:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, Ihockey, Nature. "many Canadians may be boiled internally against anger, but when they are held for Americans, but I don't bother."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who does not know himself, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians have a Canadian flag visible on their backpack when they travel.</seg>

<seg id="1769">"if Canada really would be a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that" nice "has no personality."</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no corners and edges, nothing that you can encounter."</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless is to be inconspicuous and uninteresting and no attention to earn.</seg>

<seg id="1895">"Concepción González Ramírez directs a small hotel in Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, on the border between Mexico and Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1896">Photo: Amy Brack.</seg>
<seg id="1897">This article of Amy Brack was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org.</seg>
<seg id="1898">"across the way of migrants, Europe or Latin America cross, certain places for their hospitality will be known."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is run by a 59- year-old Mexikanerin, a small woman with a corals pink brilliance and golden earrings in teddy bear."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"it is called Concepción González Ramírez and grew up in Tapachula, and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name of Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">"this nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians, who are on transit."</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no more charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2.50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms, with colon, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless, hundreds of African and Haiti have come here."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez tells people in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call:" mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you mom Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"currently, it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outside on cartons."</seg>
<seg id="1912">It does not want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy them medicines that they can't pay, she masks them with a balsam that filled out from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived recently."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui who has a yoghurstache) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Brack.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," "he answers with a smile." I really feel that it fits to her because African women are very nice women. "</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">"Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children again."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"you have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move towards north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard of other wayfarers from Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a famous name on the track, "" explains Mr. Michelet, a Guest from Haiti. "</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells you that the Haitians and the Africans often travel the track together and that Africans were already talking on Whatsapp by Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"as many of his companion managers, Michelet lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months now: he sold SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tipses.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he is in contact with Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our Mother and we will never leave her again," he answered smiling. "we will always be in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells her guests to send their often text messages if they have gone to graces or to report about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They explained that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she does not know much about Africa, but their guests have brought her to prepare chicken like in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants that travel through tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the city, there is a dead end road to Jesús Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"during this winter, Valenzuela and his family have recorded migrants in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"for the moment 25 people are here, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on blankets on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking spot outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declares that he knows what the guests are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he tells. "I experienced what they experience."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived there for three years, he was rejected by a raid on his work place from the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants, who travels through tapachula, comes from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he had escaped in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to squeeze him out of money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he was asked for an accommodation and a unknown, one allotant, has offered him their roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives there and tried to decide where the next steps should go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back to the house of Mama Africa is all again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses the travellers consult with their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, much from Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Ms. Ramírez seems to be happy that their house is full, but it is also nostalgically, because of those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother to feed them in their album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of their daughter with African hair care who made her a Kundalini, some photos of her grandchildren and many travellers more, boy and Old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She was sad to laugh at her shortly.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," "repeated every time." "they have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"a check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang from Twitter users,"</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in the west of China, are forced to install a Spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on 10 July, the mobile users of the Tianshan district of the city of Urumba received a mobile alert, in which it has to install the District Government, a surveillance app called Jingwang (or" "Web cleansing"). "</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the message, the app is said to get access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because they had installed shortly after they had installed the app, messages with a private Wechat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"in the message of the police, the app would determine and follow the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">"Jingwang is a shelter with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is the block pornographic websites, from online fraud, trough and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they are spending online, and to remotely control their home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote "state actors or even hacker could manipulate the home network of a person or to steal the home network."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while reports on digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often dark for those who in distant, suppressed ethnic minority regions like Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"to limit disturbances and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often classify extreme censored and monitoring measures as well as routinous Internet."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"this published on Twitter-based media outlet" "Images from Mainland China" (SECI), the censored news in China, showed photos from a Checkpoint, where the policemen showed the residents at optional, whether they had installed the monitoring app. "</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people are installing the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected at a checkpoint using a device without this software, they could be detained by up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">"you have forced the people to use devices, which are intended for older people."</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity to the imprisonment of rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from Mainland China" (SECC), also published a Jingwang product description, out of which the software can lift up a Windows operating system and thus gets full access to the hard drive of your computer. "</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after installing Jingwang, computers and mobiles become electronic handcuffs in Xinjiang."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang may be a reaction to the directives of the city party council to minimise the distribution of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government groups, authorities and with the party linked institutions including universities and research centres are obligated to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office in operation of their computer and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"a current report from Freedom House, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang, the authorities published on June 27th in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, a regulation with the directive to all the inhabitants and entrepreneurs, to the 1st August their" personal ID maps, mobiles, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media storage cards. "</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously any" terrorist videos "to identify and destroy. however, this action is violated the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole series of other possible offence, including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages."</seg>

<seg id="1995">"distant from our blue, virtual world you look at and show you that you are all alone in a place where everything is important."</seg>
<seg id="1996">Everything has changed after and after and revealed a truth which is clearly identifiable both inside and from outside.</seg>
<seg id="1997">One that makes her name all glory.</seg>
<seg id="1998">One who has crushed into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaphors.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"but when you get the reality again, and you leave behind the scenes - beyond the spectacle, the beautiful sceneries and performers - turn into being in essence of flesh and blood, and do all the cry of death."</seg>
<seg id="2000">"all doubts will resolve in smoke and you become aware of your existence, even if the Earth is spinning on the Axis of Unheils. it is clear that you are caught here between the walls that your parents, and before them your grandparents, stone built by stone."</seg>

<seg id="2002">He created his power over us by proof that he even destroyed the simplest concepts that we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"five teenagers were destroyed during a peaceful protest, as weeds from the beautiful garden of our revolution."</seg>

<seg id="2005">"all the city districts were sought, but my own not."</seg>
<seg id="2006">"for the first time it was quiet, regiseless, at the wrong time, even though I had no high demands on a city that is up to the arteries with state security organisms and their accomplices."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"during the third night, things had calmed down somewhat after the power supply in the district had to work."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"I broke the stillness, by crying several times" "Almighty" "from my house."</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice contradicted by the silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">A few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together.</seg>

<seg id="2023">"I was 18 years old, it was the fourth time that I stood before this building."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"perhaps it was about my folly, vanity, perhaps in the revolution."</seg>
<seg id="2025">I was so sure of my thing as I answered: "I didn't think that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"and I think I never stopped to look to your eyes, so why should I do it now?"</seg>
<seg id="2027">"it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me, and yet I do not regret a word from what I said."</seg>

<seg id="2042">"in total darkness can be seen in me no distinctive facial extracts, and doctors are not there here; we are all just numbers."</seg>

<seg id="2055">"this was the secret to protect us: to protect the state security before us and prevent the terrorists in us, they speak in alawitic dialect - thus they played their sectarian blackmailing card, and cried the close perspectives of their world view."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"this is not a home, this is not a land; it is a curse to call it coexistence to transform the criminals of their sound into a hero."</seg>

<seg id="2059">I did not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"I got used to it, not to answer."</seg>
<seg id="2061">I really cannot say exactly when insults and strokes have become a friendly communication for me to an ordinary means of communication.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how it happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">"any voice in me said that I'd probably used to get used to it, to be punished, although I had nothing to earn this punishment."</seg>

<seg id="2065">Its command is to pluck me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>

<seg id="2070">"my cry did not turn out yet enough, why they were exchanged the pipe through a cable."</seg>

<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">It must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"some hours went, which came to me like minutes."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"the door opens and the dawn fulfills the room." Raus with you, Arschficker. "</seg>
<seg id="2085">"I replied with the voice of an exhaustible youth:" "my Lord, my Father must make fearful worries."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be silent and gone, you will be relocated."</seg>
<seg id="2087">This was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they always had me released.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Where do they lead me away?!</seg>
<seg id="2090">The jordal Rapper Emsallam Hdaib speaks about the rights of LGBTQ + community; freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he lodges to his canvas, to his computer, and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">But where one can rely on it is a cigarette between his fingers or its nicotine Bejagged lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives on the top floor of his family house, which was owned by them since 1967; the year in which Israel saw its occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaibs family to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they had lived as rocky (about: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and asks their long-proven opinions about gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapmusic."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music that often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, but also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics are not only in his hometown Amman relevance, but also in cities that come from Damascus to the whole of Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his mind, and he can have compassion on the terrible consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not open it openly, he swept a special turn against the US foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, to do anything with his identity as" Palestinian refugees "- so he describes himself, even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own living conditions so," says Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I am a man, while he shook in water in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is planned for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset. "</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordal law also states that public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has had little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the slukewarm coffee and the swaiter of the Kent cigarette in the nose is first of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when you take a look at the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"of this, one simply avoids the basic things to do - as in the public during Ramadan to drink water - to not land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the Interior Ministry of Jordaniens put an appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">"a few parliamentary parliamentarians who support the Islamic Action Front - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual fronts, Hamed Sinno, who contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and be the main reason for the concert."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the deputies and former spokesperson in the Islamic coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN, that the concert was" just "because of the sexual orientation of the singer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism that demand the long-proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila adopted the jordanic people as" progressive supporter of human rights "which continued to use for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement probably should not be easy-sided rhetoric, but in fact a more and more evident-crystallizing reality in Jordan reflect that in Hdaibs work clearly appears."</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib traditional gender standards is to be Leibe by putting his vision of the fate of Arab women who have imagined sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the image shows the skeleton of a clearly down-known woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen."</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who really should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"over the past few years, the number of 'honorary mordial' has increased the inofficial outside in Jordan."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary morals in 2016 reached their peak; however, it still appears that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who tried and support victims of killings or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on migration from the year 1954 women who are exposed to danger of invigorous violence," "and for their release is often a long term of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee on the part of the family need nothing to happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"Hdaibs Music also enjoys great popularity, and is known not to reshind the subjects that are long in his country as tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib takes that his work is political, however, a fact that he is his music that is full of explicit accusations on sexuality, freedom and expression not to be separated from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I'm from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"he was said to me," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" "Lawla al 3aib" "and in" "ghoeb" "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs that are politically politically, can be continued."</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market in which one can get in his words," "whether it is faith or non-belief, Hetero- or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gays and lesbians and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + -individuals is still strongly censored up in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular jordinal Onlineprogramme Roya to later remember that his comments from the context was ripped, screwed and in his opinion been censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a edited version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib is open to the Arabic LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals do not speak to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who is still in mind thanks to its homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks: if Abu Nusomething, who later worked on behalf of the Caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanier not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hashy kingdom, nothing new is new that the government attacks attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the jordal news service held several former government members and members of the teacher, with the reasoning, they had expressed critical to the problems linked to deep in the country that are deeply rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, the concert of Hdaibs believes only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan River."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress is a continuous giving and taking. Jordan has gone for the second time in a row a gig, but the path of progress - so it looks daib - consists of slow, thanking and inner changes. he is sure that these changes from day to day at the heart of the jordan society take place."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"finally, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, also, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he dreams not only of it, his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region is getting involved with music, art and literature a genuine and basic openness - and not by bombs, extentions and artificial nature. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until then, Hdaib will continue, and therefore also resist."</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was consulted by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting to the Aman as a student Fellow.</seg>

<seg id="2150">"these great, extravagant warriors are so fantastic!!!"</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it is thought that there is a variant of tanabata festival, which is usually recorded in August in many areas of Tohocus. another theory states that the wagons, the drums, and the tances marched more than one thousand years and marched from a time, in the armies from the west of Japan in the northeast marched to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to the knees."</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"we were able to catch some great seats, so we have a great view."</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">"a joint centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, hosted a two-month exhibition at Wa no Akari (literally."</seg>
<seg id="2157">I was looking forward to seeing the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two wagons are straight to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nonetheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the fouta Festival is the only truthful - and in addition to a stunning way of spending its summer:"</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>

<seg id="2161">I was there and looked at the # NebuchaFestival.</seg>

<seg id="2168">"El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where road-consuming and illegal drug trafficking are everyday."</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, appearance and therefore also the fancy hairstyles of famous sportsmen like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallesis (Peru), Pedro Gallesis (Peru), Pedro Gallesis (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has resulted in becoming increasingly more normal citizens in the experienced hands of hairdressers that can make these elaborate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles, who go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers to Batalla de Barberos, who has been taking place since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"there are experts to compete against each other, who can create from them the eccentric Looks, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Battalla de Barberos)."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions like the school of Augusto Salazar Bondy, who found themselves in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people of it, their weapons against hairdressing tools, and instead of poor advice on hairdressers you can find work."</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: Liebesletters at guerrilla warfare</seg>

<seg id="2181">"the following article is the edited version of the paper" "Liebesmessage" "at guerrilla warfare," which has released the international online magazine Tea After Twelve. "</seg>
<seg id="2182">This entry is published here within the framework of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not even more important, people who feel overwhelming, affection with affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this question left the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the Foundation of Bogota and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation, and inspired it to the" "Cartas por la Republicliación (letters to reconciliation), the young people urged to write guerrilla letters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, her country was the venue of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiation, the Colombian Government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla war FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces), which forms the closing of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"international was considered to be the signating of the peace contract, as significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received for its merits for the Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"in front of the Colombian, there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla warfare, who lived many years in illegal bearings, were exposed to war rhetoric and imposed around the clock their weapons, now need to be integrated into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society in turn, which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guerrilla warfare, must now engage in their ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombian had to close together and would have to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that is exactly what they did before: until now thousands of young people already wrote letters - love message to former guerrifighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrication - which then should be given personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the reconciliation was created at the world summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, who took place in February 2017 in Bogotá. there were Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded in 2014 the Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"explained that we love the people whom we love, am Valentine's Day, thousands of love letters, but those who need much more necessary."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plan, he told him to share his love with people this year, the most urgent need."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"thus the plan, letters full of hope and support for former fighters of FARC, who now have to find their place in society and have to build themselves a new life." "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story of a common history of peace," "they say."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"up to now, more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I would never thought that someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to the Caldono-Cauca on 19 March in the region of Caldono-Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students of the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation of Bogota, in the camp to bring the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">"the members of the FARC did so on how they had done it earlier, in order to counter the commands of their leaders."</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders but letters full of underlining people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for all parties." it's incredible how many different feelings can be through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between, "told the policy science student Manuela Iménez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra: an employee of the governors of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we had passed the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of guerilla fighters. "</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" "Cambuches" "(a kind of hut, in which the guerriots live), I saw a guerrilla war that wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down, because next to him on the bed was a mGL pomegranates, a deadly weapon in the thorns."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"and I said it nevertheless, and asked," hello, what do they do? "he answered," I replied to a letter that someone has written to me. "</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never before in my life someone has written something so beautiful, so I responded to it. I suddenly got the tears over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him completely and set me next to the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry for the war, was sorry to be all the years of loyal companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him to write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never had something different from life than war. the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before the hungertod. "I have never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society out there that waits with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I just learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"in the prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC came into a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as a war and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore the leader of the FARC the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" "many years ago we experienced how social injustice from the State on the whole Colombian people worked out. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to shaping the society in this country."</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a goal of this magnitude, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "said one of them."</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"listening to these people who had never found heard before and had no electoral law, and to recognize that people who were often seen as monsters and even hate people who were surrounded by their living conditions and their environment was quite painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality, in which the land lives, does me sore."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforted me that all men - including those who have killed and so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">Columbikers was mismade that after disarming peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there are inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will be always people who are willing to hold the weapons and protest to their rights, and that is completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore, we call upon all the defenders of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology they belong to - to dream about all those who dream of a land in the war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring the sacrifice, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those amongst us who will defend life as the basis of existence, will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal position in Chechnya has conquered the international headlines from the world after several months after reports published, torture, torture and killing queer men in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">"the first report was released by the journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaja Gaseta; she cast a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities, the suspicious queer men mares and they found in secret prisons in Argun."</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a Transwife, was born in Grosny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"ever since their childhood, she felt that she was a woman in reality."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when they grew, you became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for them, which was why she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Chetschenen was experienced by the genital equator of her housewife, the hunt was opened on Sabrina."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"out of fear for their lives, she moved in the US to the end of the US."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a honorary assistant at a human rights organization.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"one day, I told me that someone needed my help."</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend of Dagestan, a transwife, who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took them without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, he made a friend of whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his Chechen friends, with the following message:" then there are no men more in Chechnya who can eliminate this shame? "</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that the photos of my documents made through the whole Whatsapp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was just going to show a few shopping bags from the seat of my car, I heard a men's voice:" "here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time at Chechen:" how long will you still honor the family, du Schandfleck? "</seg>
<seg id="2265">I knew the person not.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I know only that there was a young man, not 30 years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost the consciousness and woke up in the hospital again.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had received everything and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">"in the hospital, I learned that I had two sampling in my right lung."</seg>
<seg id="2272">"OC Media: in which sick, have you been laid - in the men or women of women?"</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and laid me to the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">"therefore, I am very grateful to him."</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time at his office, I got to do it with the fear; it was a muscular, a casian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he was disrespectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote to me - relatives, foreigners, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and several remote relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the slowed to send me back to Chechnya, to prove that all was a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they had absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by talking up without the streets; others wanted me to be on the official TV in Grosny and say that I had not changed my sex, that everything was bad, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what could I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how has your family tried to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once said my mother on the road.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," They have brought a monster to the world that has not only damaged your family, but the whole Republic. "</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot stir you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she lay a strick around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with darkened window washers and a numeral plate with a 95 square.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened for the third time, it was clear to me that there was something lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights-friends overthrew the numerical signs - it turned out that I have been following.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you have fled?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for safety reasons I don't want to do their name, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help I left the country, but then something unbelief."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it, without record me, without notice, without everything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came up and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"the moment when I wanted to call my mother by Whatsapp, I got a message:" you do not believe, you would be sure, just because you have left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">"our people know already, in which hotel you stume. you even know your room number."</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it to you: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we do not talk about sex equals, this is a tabutopic."</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still use some traditional catholic elements still in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"I also wish it, this spiritual barrier can not be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I am always saying that as long as my mother is in life, I will do my best to hurt them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I actually give me trouble to see how the person looks out of her past - so to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed there?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I have submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed current information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke with someone who has sent a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan was not being arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he didn't closed a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">"most likely, they will now concentrate on family and relatives."</seg>
<seg id="2328">"that mean I, they probably invite the relatives before, these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so-called" honour "experienced by blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are now even gay men in these secrets?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says it would not be very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, above all those who have no rich relatives or have dropped out of their own relatives to face Kadyrows."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they will be listed there so that they can present them as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say," "should they be killed, one will show their bodies on television and claim them, they would have attacked any village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply gone, but targeted to radicalize itself."</seg>
<seg id="2336">"OC Media: is it just a reminder, or do you have a source for this information?"</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in Argun and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people had disappeared in this prison after having grown beard.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new about them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They have simply taken them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was himself as these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, so far there has been no reports before. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would you not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people, who belong to a so-called" non-traditional "orientation" have already been in the past? "</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think I was already very much known in 2003 when I lived there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was considered, I never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to approach us to" "civilian", "but ultimately has thrown back to the stone-time."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were exhausted; I had colored eyelashes, carried skirts and short tail. "</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Safety Department of Sharia has never even curved me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every night, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is an expression: Kharda ma Kharda. that is called "Spotte not over the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">You often say it to children if those who make themselves jovial of sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so, they simply shut their eyes in front of you because they believed, you are sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They have never been offended, never hunted and never beaten. "</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this Gnadensity stopped?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrow entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak on television on morals."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he spoke not about us, but primarily about the behavior of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, one could feel like the people of the town began to change."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who had cheered and yellow previously, considered you at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the Republic constantly disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I did not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still working as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teacup, meetings, I buried them to the hospital and help them to get fences."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a penny for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I cast refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslima and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddenab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is alant.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so is nature, that has purely nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"that is exactly the same as Chechnya, who want to prophesy you with foam in front of the mouth, that there are no gays in them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have which, the Kabardiner, who, the Russians have also what; on the whole planet there are - but" "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear what to listen."</seg>
<seg id="2387">"here, I meet here so many men out of the Caucasus."</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims that go into the mosque and during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, a lot of thinking about men's identity in men who love men, and they believe that you change their sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a Trugutter."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different kinds of sensation in order to be accurate, different ways of life."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry, that I will be so personally here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not very sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2411">"the region, where the majority of Iran living in Iran living in Iran was shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to deny their livelihoods."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arabic Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi-monarchy took power and 1925 great efforts to end the ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most popular and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>

<seg id="2424">"since functionaries and institutions are preferred non-Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi movement will dispose of access to employment opportunities in all sectors."</seg>

<seg id="2434">Details of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"the following article is an revised version of the opinion published by Ayomide, and was originally published on the AfroféMinas website. the article was subject to several discussions where many different positions were expressed."</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women react - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with Frust."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even thought well-thought scientific and social arguments before me why I should be feminist and why all feminists should be inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, that women still earn less money today despite the same formation as men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women still stand under strict observation when it comes to doing what they are allowed to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women sooner or later occur in various areas of life to a gloss ceiling, and that discrimination on account of sex still moves across the many different countries and faiths."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of this and I am living twice and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet, when I talk to skin color, on racism, on black CIS, women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora, when I talk about what kind of we have been physically, psychologically and verbally abused, both in and outside the feminist movement, decide to mention many white feminists and white intersectional feminists."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"but anyway, everyone agree that women - all women - should come together to uplift their voices and 'Kumbaya, my lord' to sing 'to reach equality (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they don't want to talk about it, that in addition to sexualised violence there is an institutionalized form of racist motionous violence, which we are exposed to black women at two times."</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and origin-places earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background often referred to school as a white girl because of obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want that all women, all the men and all men of any human skin have the same rights; on the other hand I can consider myself as a black woman, in whose center the white woman stands, which refuses to relate to both sex and skin colour of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women and over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"soothes who beamed 1851 in their speech:" "I am not a woman?" "and also I refuse to maintain a ideology in which the black woman is a human and marginalised being in historical respect."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join me groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs to advance their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to raise white women the importance of overlapping skin color and gender. for some of them continue to keep the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to honor them for the better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different incomes a home and borders himself from white feminism, there is still the word" feminism "in his name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to get rid of myself full of feminism and join the movement of Womanism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of being hasty for a white feminist paradigm that is so stubborn that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it is more important than ever, that we can define black women according to our own ideas and move into the sphere that will be made of us for ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weem, the author of the book Africana womanism:" Reclaiming "(about: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves, in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be revered that make the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will call immediately separatism and exclusion after they have read these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected. "</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a bluristic environment I can uplift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I have existing.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognised because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life is neither passed nor ignored."</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and edited version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay." the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# Christmas women) which reports on violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the persons affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a Police Commissar said Ada Báez, that they had nothing against Luis Balbuena, its extradition that has become violent towards violent."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of their relationship was a little time, and the police told her statement would not be put to the acts, but more could not be done."</seg>

<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman returned its ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women refund at all once, they generally receive no support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases women are also financially dependent on the men who mismissions. this also explains why only 20% of all women, who admit to be victims of violence, present themselves at all at the law enforcement authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">Inhaler 1 beats and Statistical 2 Invisible Missions and a legal system that is nothing under nimmt3 Paraguays Laws: good approach, flawed implementation beats and statistics "</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is hard to determine how many women really misused, Myrian González, researcher for genius questions at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay." "there are various fields and reports that do not even show the scale of gender violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">However the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015 at the district state of the state of 9600 ads went on account of domestic violence. at 70% of this, it was about violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ad's ads came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5,000 ads because of domestic violence at the peace of peace. also here 86% of the ads came from."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads 40% of women were told that they were physically misused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the paraguayischen women's ministerial gifts in Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually indicated." on every woman who is refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse notification, come 9 women who do not do this. "</seg>
<seg id="2498">"every woman who is refunded because of physical abuse notification, two women who do not do this," stated in the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's suicide in Paraguay is no own crimes, the law enforcement authorities can not document properly how many women were murdered every year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"alone until August 2016, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's suicides in the country alone."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible abuse and a legal system that takes nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez was the fixed friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called his name of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning they didn't want to do that, but then there was still. this should always repent."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today Mariana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos together. but for two years, she carried the psychic force on one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe recognizable:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I have never thought that I would even be victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read earlier about it, I always thought that only women are going to be misunderstood because they deceive themselves from violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana uses social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without name to name, she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during their two year relationship described and told how he was isolated."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people answered their contributions, including Carlos themselves. he asked rhetorally, whether he ever raised the hand against it, and refused to admit that his behaviour also was a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had fallen in the so long run by Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of Missions had at least a certain degree to blame.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, which is not from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was misused."</seg>
<seg id="2517">"Victoria is a member of the network Yo te CREO (" "I believe you"), which consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse. "</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk to others about their experience, listening to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychic abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this entry by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solution possibilities for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton breeders have been salted in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"his company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredlia, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA-Astronauts in Space and consumed."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"Morton's work was done for almost 20 years only by its own ingenuity and the question, how many salads can get there, boundaries."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but in the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents are not only for single varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green ton or curved leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more and more such patents have been registered on ever more plants like grain or carton varieties. due to these trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security around the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia old tradition, Morton still finds salad, he still needs longer, since his work is ever more complicated by ever more restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It's like that I would lie down a rock in a river around which I have to pick up.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do it now, but it is a break with the breeding-tradition," he says. "I think these patents go on salads too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand in court, no one can breed more of a new salads, because all the characteristics are patented, thus trying to breeder the characteristics that he wants."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and tries to use no material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">It is also connected to a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("open source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred red Römersalat the variety of outredded in the "greenhouse gas station" of the station and ate. there's tested whether plants in space can be grown.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds more like that would come from the IT sector and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the open source Seed initiative (initiative for" "open source" "seeds) can be inspired by the movement for free" open source "software, providing alternatives to copyright protected software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">She was launched into life to ensure that some plant species and gens are not protected as intellectual property and can be used permanently for plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called Ossi, we can commit US breeders, that others may be able to use the seed free of them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they can continue to do business with their seeds and sell it." open source "breeders allow only one to cross it, to cross it, to cross their own varieties, and it does not immediately pronounce them - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant patronage or prescribed."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emeried professor of University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-board member Jack Klopenburg are control of the seed and the ability to breed new plants, both for food safety and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to seeds, he plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to make the latter or not only a little by making seed with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Klopenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement is not employed with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented whether vegetables, corn, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." to buy our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the increasingly common mergers in the global agrarian industry, as well as the recent examples the interpositions of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer, should also know that the manner is cultivated in August or September 2016, should also know that the way of this vegetable is bred. "</seg>
<seg id="2654">"food sovereign without seed, is not possible."</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed initiative are committed to providing others with seeds, so that their approach is based on seeds and plant characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supplies is endangered because of the available genpool due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore more and more restrictive, incessantly shrink."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, Executive director of the Ossi, has engaged in her doctoral work with genetical variation of carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all cartotings are protected as intellectual property, whereby it is either not or only usable for plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants there are such estimates still not, but experts like Luby suspect that mass-protected plants like wheat is patented in an even bigger style than salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of point of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so cultivated so that they have targeted features - of those who enhances their taste or colour up to such because they flourish in certain environments and to steal threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeder is decreasing by ever more patents. however, genetic diversity may be more inferior than ever before, since the changed conditions caused by climate change are far worse."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail Monsanto chiefs Carly Scaduto that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Monsantos activities. with a total of four comrades and cooperation with institutions such as the United State Department of the United States, the company is focusing on the preservation of genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts that intellectual property restricts other breeders, as" patents and the protection of plant-related innovations. "" a patent is basically taken a plan that can be followed as soon as the patent is up. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions are helping others to come with another method for the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not inhibit innovations but promotes them by providing the public with more material and know-how.</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees this different: 20 years to wait until a patent expire, is certainly no innovation."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait so long to breed on plants that have been adjusted to the changed environmental conditions, you have already lost the battle."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main argument for Morton is however, that genetic resources have always been a general public and should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities and moneinary incentives are not appealing to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their job easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what motivates us, and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton interferes in the concept of itself, plant-characteristics:" we do not create the characteristics themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders have finally no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, Plant Breeding in the US-State Oregon and Ossi-board member, there is another important aspect of the plant breeding:" who rescues a variety, and his own values are breeding into them. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in the industrial agriculture with large farms and monokultures, for whose cultivation, Herbicides are needed, which breeding in his varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is precise. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that are moving on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, make it possible to survive most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either reject it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile, or both are the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden salads.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the view that breeders by preventing the plant patentent innovative would:" it looks like I mean with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies, the paternity. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need constantly new material for my catalogue because I know that my competitor is selling my varieties in a couple of years ago," he says. "with a patent one is about 20 years ahead of competition, with what makes my opinion very pretty simple." "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"while the US seem to be leading in the" open source "breed, the concept now spreads rapidly around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources, a" open source "seed program, the center with farmers working together and helps them to breed new grades to meet certain requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2685">"it also supports them to come to" open source "seeds, and to sell their own."</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organisation Agreements is working on an" open source "license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(regulations for breeding differ from country to country, or because of the Ossi obligation cannot simply become one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive committee of the European Union, the European Commission, explains that conventional plants bred not patenting. thus, she speaks against the current practice of the European patent of patent, which is based on conventionally cultivated plants."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; it is now on the governments of the Member States to implement the patent office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organised a conference on" open source "seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seeds and seed companies from all East Africa to learn something about the" open source "seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patenting seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for" open source "seed systems explains that the organization currently stands out a worldwide alliance of" open source "seed systems, which will be the official launch next year."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a consortium of environmental protection and development aid groups (among them hivos, the international nonprofit development organization USC Canada and the action group at erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database to seeds, technology and concentration) to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global Alliance for the future of Food - a composite of aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - published a report. in this they represent the opportunity that farmers have the opportunity to improve and improve the seed policy, so that a stable supply of food can be ensured."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"in the report also emphasized the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection, by the Luby of Ossi hopes to see him soon more people."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological food mainly took care of where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role, so Luby." we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food. "</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the newest objectives of the censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still unlock content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it hit the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnists.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"on the weekend of the 05.August, the Egyptian government conducted the website of the SNetwork for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights abuses in Egypt and the Arab world."</seg>

<seg id="2725">"the SNetwork for Human Rights information remains intact despite this attack and the rejection of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities, to uncover the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it was never that important as now. ANHRI confirmed that all technical possibilities should be exhausted, so that all technical possibilities had been exhausted, so that it has never been so difficult to overcome these goals. we insist on continuing our task further."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is regarded as the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked out 21 websites before more than two months, including the independent news page MADA Masr, Arab-speaking network of Al Jazeera due to alleged" support of terrorism.

<seg id="2731">"bloggers, who is home in the Chinese blog, on the other hand, is further accessible."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent almost 500 days in captivity until he was arrested by Egyptian security forces during December 2013 and recorded a video like the police force of physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article revolve mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook commentary, Ziada spoke about the block by the government and reflected what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"the, blogs to lock is very old, but has in the era of Abdelfatal al-Sisi priority; and even if the blockage of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is however for two reasons for me:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It has been able to convey to me the feeling of an insagment; a arrest, a attempted murder, unloading of the National Security Council, the blocking blogs as well as any other website, for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) You have proven that I was not in vain. in other words, my words have an influence, even if only on a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"first, I used it to the post of articles to circumvent the censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"but now, after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mute go the way up to the end.</seg>

<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12th we noticed how the blocking of web pages, the VPNs began."</seg>
<seg id="2746">"such a practice refers to the intention of the government to block and filter content, on which Egyptian users could have access."</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation will additionally aggravated that the censored decisions are made behind closed doors, thereby causing the Egyptian population to deal with no legal basis, with which they can proceed to judgment against these actions."</seg>

<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured due to the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the fact that the government called last week from solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state shower.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain where there were 4 dead.</seg>
<seg id="2836">"it is estimated that there were more than 500 fireps, spread across the north and centrally located regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages."</seg>

<seg id="2854">"the environmental organization Quercus made aware that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of slightly burning wood, like in a vicious circle, according to fires of this kind."</seg>
<seg id="2855">"these problems occur to the fact that the civil protection website from Portugal on 15 and 16 October, as resident information requested or tried to contact relatives, was offline."</seg>
<seg id="2856">"it was a private initiative, which provided the people with information supplied: they used their own civil protection data using the application foos.pt, and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires."</seg>
<seg id="2857">"the project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina in order to simplify the work of fire brigades, and was subsequently adopted on this fateful weekend in October so that the servers followed the onslaught of 400,000 users who followed the fires, did not count the website more than half a million access."</seg>

<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">Some days after his escape Asharaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">He worked for a couple of years in a coal pit. the work was heavy and made him ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">"then he took what was left of his wages, and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and towed bags with mortar, the heavier than he himself, in order to earn a living."</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then as today the life of Afghan refugees was marked by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard, it recalled Ashark in an interview with Global Voices." we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on site on which we worked. "</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no services there and no heating. we left nylon in front of the open windows so that we were not frozen overnight at night.</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years Ashark left his life without papers in Iran, and made ready for travel to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"during the dangerous crossing of the sea, he suffered shipwreck and strangendered on a small, uninhabited Greek island."</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Ashark came to Italy in 2002. "</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time was Asharaf obtainable, walked alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church who shared twice the day food for needy persons."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for expired asylum seekers, but it is true also that the conditions that asylum seekers in the country can be catastrophic."</seg>
<seg id="2898">The Civil Rights Organization for Europe writes the system "suffers under a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"the large majority of the asylum seekers is accommodated in more than 3000" special reception centers. "this is improvised, in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to a recording centre when they officially submitted an application for asylum - which can be drawn after the registration of the asylum request."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then, people who have no money for accommodation, either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the road."</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Ashark.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unduous lifestyle helped Ashark to free himself from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">"after having done several years working in construction industry for several years, Asharaf observes his entire savings in the establishment of a hostel in Venice."</seg>
