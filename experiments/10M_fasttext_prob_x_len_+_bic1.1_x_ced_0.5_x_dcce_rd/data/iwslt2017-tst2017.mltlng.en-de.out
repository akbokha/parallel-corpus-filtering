this is James R@@ isen .
perhaps you know him maybe because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize in the New York Times @-@ Times .
&quot; long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book , in which he published spectacular that the NSA heard illegal phones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA had literally over dra@@ fts for an atomic bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter did not fall at all ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has established on R@@ isen and called on it to call its alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this move , he became a symbol for the pattern of government , wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer to condemn and re@@ pit@@ ching journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Treaty , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media cannot get this information , and if the identity of the mu@@ te can not protect them . &quot;
&quot; so when the government was anch@@ oring up , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters already did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , only days before the process , something exceptional . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they had been left for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government on pensions were dropped . &quot;
&quot; the reason : in the period of electronic surveillance , the Reporter and the sources can hide themselves less and less . &quot;
&quot; instead of failing and pushing for statements , this could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ator , without his consent , his telephone calls are secretly concerned , &quot;
&quot; just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , his loans , and even rice @-@ wise with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Ster@@ ling , a CIA @-@ wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wer and ris@@ ens supposed to be condemned . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer to protect . but instead , the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too far from their work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wer to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; we therefore put the press in the game that is to be protected by the first constitutional record , because the government has more possibilities to raise all of them . &quot;
&quot; however , just as technology of the government allows to use the rights of re@@ porters , the press may also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; and indeed , they can contact the moment in which they contact , rather than in retrosp@@ ect . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software , which has not yet been written when R@@ isen had written his book and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mail or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transm@@ itter system for wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , originally developed by the Internet famous , which was originally developed by us , Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I work . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , such as the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send documents , just as in any ordinary contact form . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server which only has the relevant message agency .
&quot; so the government cannot provide more information secretly , and many of the information they would demand would not be available from the outset . &quot;
&quot; Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole , to protect the press freedom in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ection technologies that may end@@ anger us all . &quot;
&quot; it is to make sure that not only technology look like Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to make mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , &quot;
&quot; who knows about ab@@ uses during the supply of soldiers and tell about crowded hospitals . or the next environmental staff , the alarm for contaminated water from F@@ lin@@ t proposes . or a Wall@@ street in@@ sider , who warned us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to un@@ cover the crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thanks .
&quot; &#91; on 3 April 2016 the largest data le@@ ck of the story was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; reveal that emp@@ ires and powers are hidden from Global Wit@@ ness by Global Wit@@ ness . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ate Robert Pal@@ mer from Global Wit@@ ness to an explanation . &#93; this week we were interviewed by news about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the offshore law firm Mos@@ z@@ ca .
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the Secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; we will get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers are going to companies such as Mos@@ que Fon@@ se@@ ca and say , &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up it ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works , as it works . &quot;
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
&quot; also , there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bashar al @-@ Assad has a tax @-@ Assad in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars led to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin , a close friend of children , a famous cell@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are waiting to wait for the next release , and to the next revealed documents . &quot;
now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
&quot; it seems cri@@ es away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we address this ?
&quot; the truth is , if the rich and powerful is able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not to pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and this affects us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenomenal . &quot;
&quot; throughout the world , media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax hav@@ ens are used by some of them to hide their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing it for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people will see this whole world very confusing , and it is hard to understand how these tax hav@@ ens function . &quot;
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so one has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for pro@@ secu@@ tions and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to understand what matters is . &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the US .
&quot; probably because there were no prominent Americans now , which occurred in these revelations . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not that there are no rich Americans to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; but through the principle , after which these tax hav@@ ens function , Mos@@ pe Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we would have a data le@@ ck of the Cay@@ man Islands or Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples to have ties to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that in some US states less information is necessary to provide less information to start a company than to get a libr@@ arian . &quot;
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US allowed it to z@@ oom employees from school .
it has frau@@ ds allowed to z@@ oom especially appealing investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does that work ?
so we sent a c@@ apped investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator provided itself as an African Minister , who wanted to bring suspected money to the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; we really sho@@ ved it that all up to an attorney made by our investig@@ ator , how he could transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; these were all prec@@ urs@@ ors . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course no one was handed over to money to anybody . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as a single case .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted to our c@@ apped investigations .
&quot; it is not about a single leading policymakers , involved in a scandal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we need to change the rules . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult .
&quot; this may sound very dull , as if we could not do anything against it , as if nothing had ever changed , as if it will always be the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a born optim@@ ist , I really see that quite a lot has started to change . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen demonstrations to more transparency , which concerns the owners of companies . &quot;
&quot; the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in 2013 , in Northern Ireland . &quot;
&quot; since then , the EU is based in central regul@@ ators at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe , and who controls them . &quot;
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama &apos;s revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
&quot; we need ordinary people who become angry when they see , how other people can hide their true identity behind the head@@ land . &quot;
&quot; we need managers in the economy , who stand up and say , &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians to recognize the problem and use it to end through laws this kind of transparency . &quot;
&quot; together we can end the in@@ transpar@@ ence , which now allows these kinds of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ undering , finally end . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I had almost kidn@@ apped and in the trunk of a red ma@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; one day after I finished my design studies , I did a back@@ on sale . &quot;
a guy got up in the red Maz@@ da and looked at my things .
he bought one of my art works .
&quot; he was alone in the city , and just made a road@@ trip all over the country . after that , he would go to peace cor@@ ps . &quot;
I invited him on a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I became tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him , &quot; Where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says that he would go to peace sk@@ or@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning . I will not ab@@ duc@@ ted in the trunk of a Maz@@ ar ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard myself saying : &quot; I have an air @-@ rats . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; h , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was in bed , I star@@ ed in the blan@@ ket and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what did I get to the broken ? &quot;
a wild alien sleeping in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I got out of bed , on toe pointed at the door , and my sleep door closed . &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the artwork that he had bought from me today depends on his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my point of view .
&quot; perhaps people who were sold to me in childhood as foreigners , actually friends , who only waited for it ? &quot;
&quot; to accommodate people on my air@@ bed , it was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air rats . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s take a time , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost bank@@ ite , my room@@ mate draws up and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I believe , creativity can make it , be afraid to turn into fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought how we could earn something about it . our apartment is equipped with a designer bed and breakfast . young designers are able to stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air @-@ rats and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happ@@ i@@ est guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on a wooden floor in wooden floors .
&quot; they found it super , and we also found it . &quot;
&quot; I am sure our cheese ham O@@ mel@@ et@@ ts tasted completely different , because we made them for our guests . &quot;
&quot; we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest , and the door to the castle fell , rigi@@ dly Brian and me . &quot;
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent at the same time ?
things came into the roles .
&quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out whether you could make a business concept .
&quot; we presented our Invest@@ ors : &quot; we would like to create a website , on which people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors you close by . &quot;
&quot; over the internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them . &quot;
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the rocket would ign@@ ite .
&quot; indeed , they do not . &quot;
&quot; no one who is still in comfort , would invest in a business , the stranger allowed to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we as children have all learned that foreigners are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you have the things that you can do well . we were able to design . &quot;
&quot; at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and ap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience . &quot;
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create through design immense trust between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design be able to do something ?
is it possible to create confidence with design trust ?
&quot; I would like to give you a precious sample , what degree trust we did . &quot;
it is a 30 @-@ seconds experiment . it will force you out of your com@@ for@@ tz@@ one .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your phone into the hand .
&quot; now , I would like to unlock your mobile phone . &quot;
type your ent@@ lock@@ able mobile phone from your left sitting hand .
&quot; this quietly junction of panic , which you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts are feeling when they open the door for the first time . &quot;
&quot; for the only thing is more personal than your mobile phone , your home is home . &quot;
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , you can see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the ste@@ ered cell phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
&quot; so , most guests feel when they are elsewhere . &quot;
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; only once , who has now Al Gor@@ es mobile phone ? &quot;
could you pro@@ claim to Twitter that he comp@@ lies for the president of the president ?
you can return the mobile phones now .
you now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail at this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor had presented only once with his name ; if he had told how he comes , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
&quot; imagine , you would have 150 covers , which are all saying : &quot; &quot; he can really hold very well @-@ eliminated mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you would have to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well arranged feedback system strengthens confidence .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
&quot; it was hard for people , negative assessments . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we decided to wait until both host and guest provided their assessments before we put them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new discovered .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are at age and residence . &quot;
little surprisingly we trust the people most who are most similar to us .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social lecture .
this is exciting when one adds to the call of a person -- in our case by judgment .
&quot; if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but one has more than ten , changes everything . &quot;
a good reputation sti@@ ff common .
the right design can therefore help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preference .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you can see from yourself . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; when you tell too little about how &quot; &quot; hi ! &quot; , &quot; you do not get an answer . &quot;
&quot; one tells you much , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request will not be accepted too . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; &quot; T@@ olle art@@ works in your apartment ! I do with my family holiday . &quot;
how can I create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against foreigners .
&quot; what we had not expected , was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay these prejudices . &quot;
here you see how many people take our offer .
one can recognize three things .
firstly : incredibly good luck .
&quot; second , the tirel@@ ess work of our team . &quot;
&quot; third , if required , which was not covered before . &quot;
for us the business runs very well .
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything is smooth . &quot;
there were guests who have rude parties or devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when trust was broken .
&quot; there is nothing fu@@ lim@@ mer@@ it as these calls . it already hur@@ ts , if I just think . &quot;
&quot; the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers , was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million tons of nights had only a fraction of the problem . &quot;
for people trust each other .
&quot; if confidence works , it can be something wonderful . &quot;
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host took him to the hospital .
he even sp@@ out blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
perfect house for travellers looking for sitting activities to heart attack .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real prot@@ ections , which can save one life , even though they don &apos;t even know each other . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they do not want you to feel lonely , they bring books by . &quot;
they can even leave a longer without the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so of course does not work every stay .
but these relations behind the pure money @-@ action are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled about this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with monetary transactions fit together ?
it is here an economic trade .
&quot; but it is now simply called &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; the thing will not do justice . &quot;
&quot; share Economy describes a trade , which promises human relationships . &quot;
humans place a part of themselves openly and that changes everything .
&quot; when you travel today , it is to compare to fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but it is less auth@@ en@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; what would be , however , if travelling a rich buffet from local impressions would be ? &quot;
&quot; what if at any place you have visited , a group there would be Ans@@ äs@@ si@@ ger to wait for a thorough and show one in a bar @-@ pent@@ agon quarter of which one has never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five star cook ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would like to design apartments from scratch on the other side ?
how would that look like ?
what if cities would share the thoughts of a common share ?
&quot; I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships , instead of lon@@ eliness and de@@ preci@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already begun . a lot of parking that belonged to the government . &quot;
&quot; they were offered by the inhabitants . students , who were in search of a place , &quot;
&quot; were introduced to people whose children were moved . there were incub@@ ator programs , &quot;
&quot; in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy , our platform alone today will be 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries at a foreign or even host . &quot;
the idea seems to not be so crazy about how it was brought to us .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
&quot; hospitality , there were also previously . &quot;
there were similar websites before us .
so why has just our works ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome profound prejudices .
&quot; I find this amazing , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da is passing by me .
we of course know that design cannot solve every problem .
&quot; but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design soon . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; subjected to in@@ doctr@@ ination , a terrorist &quot;
or simply a delay in the safety check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people that look like me .
one study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : the Americans mean most would not know Muslims .
probably people do not talk to their ham@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for those who have never met a Muslim , it is great to meet you . &quot;
I say to you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee maker -- dou@@ bling es@@ pres@@ so , with cream . &quot;
I am both intro@@ ver@@ ted
a Mö@@ ch@@ te@@ cher @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual muscle . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I was not so born . &quot;
I have decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old I decided to ou@@ ting me .
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ osexual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to carry my head@@ gear . &quot;
my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why are you oppressed yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the Fun@@ ny was : at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence , and in contrast to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year old , to suit me a perfect and un@@ at@@ tainable beauty ideal . &quot;
I have accepted not only passive belief in my parents .
I have to do with the Koran .
&quot; I read it , thought , was asked , asked , and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow @-@ surrender which deep@@ ened with any reading of the corridor .
the beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
it feels that way .
&quot; later I married and began , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later I had , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot; &quot;
then that aw@@ ful morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I was sitting in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked on the screen and looked at the word &quot; &quot; E@@ il@@ der@@ eg@@ istration &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , planes flew in buildings , people sp@@ ears out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock was changed rapidly in outra@@ ge .
why should you do something like that ?
&quot; I joined the TV channel and heard &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mecca ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it has not only been attacked my country , but in N@@ u consul@@ ted me the deeds of others from a civil war into an susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle West of the United States to move into a new city and start with a post@@ graduate course . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I drove me -- when we were silent -- so deep it went out into my seat , and I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we moved into our apartment at night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then heard , I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said , &quot; be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d war@@ y , &quot; &quot; lead in well illuminated areas &quot; , &quot; Ver@@ sam@@ mm@@ elt not you . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday during that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; and again the warnings : &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who held out for Muslims , and struck me free . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who have attacked this land have attacked our land .
I have drawn the anger of people to terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain yourself .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love issues . &quot;
there are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; nowadays , we can actually say people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot;
when will we go on ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslim and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor can be seen as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor only under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the US , but a life @-@ important organ . &quot;
thanks !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , instruc@@ tors and Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques are more secure ?
&quot; maybe there will be some parking available , but not stop the terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit to a mosque leads to consider people other belief tolerant , and greater civil participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a head of the police in the Washington D.C. , DC recently told : people are actually not radical in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; when the radic@@ alization process has been determined that it starts off online . as a first , the person is cut off from their church , that the extre@@ mes will cause the true Muslims , and anyone who desp@@ ises their behavior and its ideology is a tra@@ itor , or of faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we need to stop the people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some will still assert that Islam is a violent religion .
eventually a group like the IS reveals its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a person , I think we must do everything to stop a group such as the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would add ourselves to their imagination , if you acknowledge them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers . &quot;
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology reasons on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but when one casts a look at it , it is not pushing them what they are in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that let them read these things in Scripture .
an excellent ima@@ m told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she had imagined to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every spiritual , with whom she had spoken , she brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into difficulties . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that had given purpose to their anger , it was a main target for the instrum@@ alization by extremis@@ ts who promised her a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m gave the connection to God and her church again .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what they learned in the mosque , they kept to join the IS . &quot;
it was an insight to how the Islam@@ ophobia and my family is concerned .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affects our democracy every day on our thoughts of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- when we fear that at least three things happen .
&quot; we accept rather an author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formance and prejudices . &quot;
&quot; a study shows : if you have reports to test messages , in which negative information was reported on Muslims , they would rather have military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just a academic problem .
&quot; if you look , when the mood against Muslims down@@ lap -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in the context of terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened before the war of Iraq and during two election periods .
&quot; thus , Islam@@ ophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem @-@ terror as I expected . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public to eradic@@ ate the foundation of a free society , the rational and well informed citizens . &quot;
dealing with Moslems is an early warning .
&quot; we may feel it perhaps the first , but the toxic air of fear leads us all . &quot;
&quot; in the assignment of collective inno@@ c@@ ence , it is not only about to explain itself to itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a athle@@ te .
&quot; he was at the dental Fac@@ ulty , talented , much promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , generous man , whom she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when has come from my br@@ otherhood , such a sealed young man ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne in her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Craig Stephen Hi@@ cks , she was assass@@ inated , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an that was on the afternoon to visit . he did it in her apartment , as with a execution , after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he died eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
have we gone to the mosque or stayed safe at home ?
&quot; we bes@@ ought it and for us it was not an easy decision , for it was about which America we want to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion . &quot;
we decided to the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the Kinder@@ sitz , we drove silent , with high pressure to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , and my shoes went out , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw , let me stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , than@@ ked his guests , because half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Buddh@@ ists , athe@@ ists , believers and non @-@ believers who have come to attack us , but to teach us . &quot;
in that moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion and prejudi@@ ced prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be sure to number ?
or will you join to those who mean : we are better than that .
many thanks .
thanks beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia you seem to have met a nerve .
&quot; but I ask myself , what do you say that you might say that you are holding an TE@@ D@@ Talk , working a thin@@ ker with dr@@ au@@ ght , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say if you don &apos;t . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; looking at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
&quot; so , in no respect I am an exception . &quot;
&quot; if people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule is broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what started as a platform for cra@@ fting , is about to be a billi@@ on@@ aire business . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journalism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial threats . this is made possible in research facilities worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air parcel transfer into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . a few years ago they started to fly with rop@@ es . &quot;
by inter@@ locking flight devices high speed and acceleration in the narro@@ west space .
you can also build self @-@ constantly moving structures .
&quot; they have learned to wear bur@@ dens , deal with turbul@@ ence , and generally respond to natural laws . &quot;
&quot; today , we would like to show you some of our new projects . &quot;
our goal is to exceed the limits of the Pos@@ sible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; so that a system works autonom@@ ously , it must be collective en@@ vy where in the room the mobile objects are located . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ET@@ H Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . that enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynam@@ ical tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , an off@@ ences of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , comp@@ ut@@ ations on board , what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands exist on the highest level , e.g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and land . &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter , &quot;
&quot; a leaf@@ let , which tries to beat two flies with a cap . &quot;
&quot; like other starters , it is efficient in the forward @-@ upward flight , much more efficient as the helicopter in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most starters , it can float outside , and thus has a great advantage in the start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a downside . &quot;
a restriction of hits is that they are sensitive on turbul@@ ence such as wind arches .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the air device doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research we often present basic abstract questions that are at the core of the matter .
such a question would be for example : what is the petty @-@ possible number of mov@@ ables for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicopter are about to be known as machines with a thousand movable parts that join forces to hurt you .
decades ago skilled pilots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled air devices that had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a tail@@ gate .
&quot; long ago , we discovered that flying with only one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the mono@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically easiest dri@@ fting device . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only a movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no cl@@ ap , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ ps , no further footprint or controversi@@ es , only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , happening in the interior live very much so that it can fly stable and move into space . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tail@@ gate . to bring it to flying , I need to throw it correctly . &quot;
&quot; the likelihood to throw it right , if all of me is low , therefore I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; when the mon@@ h@@ inner is an exercise in happiness , this machine is here , the om@@ kop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ell@@ ors , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this over@@ flow ?
they see that he is only sy@@ mmet@@ ric .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
&quot; as a result , he receives the proper ability , &quot;
&quot; move into space in all directions , no matter which direction it is rot@@ ated or even as it rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers , of the eight pro@@ pane . &quot;
&quot; a lot is adjustable in models , the rest will learn directly at the fly . &quot;
let &apos;s see this again .
&quot; when flying machines to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and secure . &quot;
this machine is made up of two separate twin @-@ prop@@ ellers .
this is about a clo@@ ck@@ wise direction
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise direction .
when you build them together they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
&quot; however , something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine even if limited . &quot;
we will now demonstrate that by half a flight .
the last demonstration are investigated synthetic s@@ warming .
&quot; the crude number of autonomous , co @-@ ordin@@ ated units offers a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took wholesale micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with local technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the especially safe machine there is to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to pre@@ dict the influence of this technology . &quot;
for guys like us the pay is in the development and the creative act .
&quot; it serves as a memory , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it is creative , clever creatures allowed to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such solid commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
&quot; 1,3 billion years ago surrounded by two black holes in a very far remote Galaxy two black holes one another ever faster , they turned into a tenth of the crowd in a tenth point in a tenth of a ti@@ ghter . &quot;
this short time sh@@ red@@ ded them bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe .
it was a very great b@@ ang .
but their energy did not put it in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy has been given into the space @-@ time texture itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we arrange the events at first time .
1.3 billion years ago the majority of life on earth was being created .
&quot; since then , the Earth has produced things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sau@@ r , people and -- God stand with us -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; approximately 25 years ago , a group specifically decided -- R@@ ai We@@ iss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from the Cal@@ tech -- to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves that arise about col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them they were crazy .
&quot; but enough people realized them as a crazy genius , so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the Det@@ ector L@@ IG@@ O : the laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ om@@ eter - gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves observatory . &quot;
&quot; in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of L@@ IG@@ O could greatly increase what the recognition performance could be enormous . &quot;
therefore it is called Advanced L@@ IG@@ O .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , L@@ IG@@ O was launched for a last test run to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the departure from my death @-@ sick father .
basically they were the fruits of my life .
&quot; all that , for what I had worked , is no longer Science F@@ ic@@ tion ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physic@@ ists at MIT . he has examined for 23 years of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves from black holes and their by observatory such as L@@ IG@@ O measurable signals . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a c@@ abling in the fabric of space and time .
&quot; by passing the wave , the space and its entire content is stretched in a direction and stretched into the other . &quot;
&quot; to illustr@@ ative faculty , teachers in courses of rel@@ ativity @-@ theory often lead a really good dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridiculous . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September , for example , each one was stretched out of the waves at the asc@@ ending of the waves and gest@@ ures . the stretching of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that means 20 N@@ ul@@ ls after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 Dar@@ um , one declared the L@@ IG@@ O employee for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometres long laser det@@ ector , which is already absurd , this length would have to be measured on less than a 1000@@ th of the radius of a nuclear fight . that &apos;s grot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classical text over gravity
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder Lig@@ os , hunting for the waves in the following way : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; physic@@ ists are dark , and with the support of the public will certainly all obstacles be overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne has published this in 1973 for 42 years prior to its success .
&quot; back to L@@ IG@@ O . Scott maintains , L@@ IG@@ O is more than an eye than an eye . &quot;
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength that is much smaller than the things around us : facial extracts , the size of your cell phone . &quot;
this is quite practical . for this way you can make a picture or a map of things by taking advantage of the light around you .
in sounds it is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things that mean to you especially much : &quot;
the face of your child approximately .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain properties like clay and height , rhythm and volume , to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , it is talking straight Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob under@@ breaks them . &quot;
&quot; du@@ ous Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make them easy pictures of objects in space .
&quot; but by reading changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for L@@ IG@@ O are the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble area .
&quot; so when we convert wave patterns to Sch@@ all , we can literally speak the universe . &quot;
&quot; the gravity of lau@@ ghing can give us about much about the collision of two black holes , so my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time . &quot;
&quot; S@@ H : two black , non @-@ rot@@ ate holes , circular simple : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
the two bodies are turning very fast , you hear the same circle with an additional ton@@ ic change . that sounds like W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u ! &quot;
it is a kind of movement that shapes in the wav@@ e@@ form .
&quot; AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard L@@ IG@@ O Fol@@ ding : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ des sound &#93; jem@@ and , who knows what he needs to hear , this recognizes as a sound of -- S@@ H : ... two black holes with the 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which turn around as fast as the sticks of your mix@@ ers . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s just think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dense body in space , one with a mass of 29 Son@@ nen , the other with a mass of 36 probe , orbit each one hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces in front of you .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we have heard it .
therein lies the abi@@ ding meaning of L@@ IG@@ O .
L@@ IG@@ O p@@ aves a completely new way to study the al@@ ls as it was never possible before .
on this road we can hear the universe and the invisible .
much in all we can -- practical or basically -- not to see .
&quot; a super @-@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why mas@@ hed stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de . &quot;
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the space .
&quot; the exciting physical operations occur however , at the core , which is hidden behind thousand kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never see you as these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron , as if it would be more transparent glass . the Ur@@ b@@ ang . I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it as the judgment is covered through his / her own lighting . &quot;
using gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
&quot; and that is most important : I am FEEL@@ ING that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen before , and of which we have no idea of which we can only discover , by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , L@@ IG@@ O found right in the first attempt to do things that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the L@@ IG@@ O project , says to this topic : me : the type of stars , the black holes emerge , like L@@ IG@@ O they observed , are the dinosau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . black holes are so to say the su@@ b@@ ules for our arche@@ ological work . &quot;
&quot; L@@ IG@@ O provides us with a completely different angle of view on the events of space , in the emergence of the stars , and ultimately as we came out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now exists to be as brave as possible .
thanks L@@ IG@@ O we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new Observ@@ atory -- a whole new generation of Observ@@ atories in Earth and All .
because what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
a while ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; for a year I would say to all &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; before which I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; whether it made me nervous to me in unpleasant situations , I forced me &quot; &quot; yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak in public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
wanted to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
would I start playing with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes . &quot;
and a mad thing happened : exactly what I was afraid of when I was afraid to eliminate my fear .
&quot; my fear , speeches to hold , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , weg . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , my life changed . &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me . &quot;
&quot; but there was a certain Yes , which my life deeply changed , on an unexpected art . it started with a question of my youngest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for in@@ explic@@ able reasons all &quot; estim@@ ating &quot; ; &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; estimate , I need milk for my um@@ bili@@ cal asse . &quot;
&quot; she asked me once I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; a new attitude to my family . from there I swe@@ ar , always playing with them as soon as you call me on . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I am not perfect , but I am trying . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , to my children , to our family . &quot;
but it also has an intriguing side effect : only recently I understood actually that the &quot; yes &quot; Sa@@ gen to play with my children my career .
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am author . I think things out , get you down to life . &quot;
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I want to be creative television .
I make TV , in a great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for driving 70 hours of program into the world . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
&quot; every shipment offers hundreds of jobs , which previously did not exist . &quot;
the budget for an episode of a tel@@ escope can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode all nine days four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars TV , four TV programs , 4 episodes TV , three episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series will run each other on Thursday evening .
all over the world my series will run in 256 regions in 256 regions for 30 million viewers .
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are shows that I myself created , and not only produced , so I must find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans of the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four television series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire , which burn around the world . &quot;
do you know who that still makes ?
&quot; no one , which is why I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I say to you all of you who work so hard , whether you &apos;re planning a company , a country or a classroom , take me seriously if I speak of work , so you understand that I am not only at the computer t@@ ore and imagin@@ ative , and it &apos;s true when I say , I understand that it is not about dre@@ aming at a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am absorbed into the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
it &apos;s like when I set troops on a canvas .
&quot; so called a high tone , lying a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , stren@@ uous and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and maternal , cruel and reasonable , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the buzz . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
&quot; a buzz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the buzz sounds like a busy street , I could always drive on it . &quot;
&quot; many people take when I declare them the buzz that I am writing writing , that writing is my pleasure . &quot;
don &apos;t understand me wrong it does .
&quot; but the buzz -- when I started with television production , when I began to work and work , build and work together , I discovered this thing , this buzz , this energy . the buzz ! &quot;
the sums is more than writing .
the buzz is action and activity . the sums is a drug .
the buzz is music . the sums is light and air .
the sums is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a buzz , then you cannot be different from size . &quot;
&quot; feel , not to be different than to strive for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is what you call the buzz .
or maybe it also means a work@@ a@@ holic .
perhaps it is called genius .
perhaps it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I know only that I am not made for failure , and I just know I love the buzz . &quot;
&quot; I will only say to you , I am a Titan , and I know that I will not ask it into question . &quot;
&quot; to make a clear one : the more successful I will , the more outcomes , the more survival there is , the more things are there , the more things I write history , the more my expectations there is . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what do I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , not true ? &quot;
&quot; the land which I sh@@ out , the marathon , which I run , the army , the high sound , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz . &quot;
I like this buzz . I love the buzz .
I need the buzz . I am the buzz .
am I just this buzz ?
and then stopped the buzz .
&quot; revised , over@@ powered , exaggerated , hidden . &quot;
the sums stopped .
&quot; now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth , that her mother is a single worker . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; Behold , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da land . &quot;
there are the children of a tit@@ ans .
you are Baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the buzz heard . &quot;
the buzz of the engine was pet@@ ri@@ fied .
I did not love my job any more . the engine was off .
the sums did not come back .
my buzz was broken .
&quot; I did the same things as always : the same tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , completed weekends , no re@@ mor@@ es , nothing deleg@@ ate , a Titan sleeps , does not exist , with full heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no buzz .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was an indication @-@ Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the buzz and the buzz I was .
&quot; so what do you do , if what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some may think : &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l You from , Bl@@ essed author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you do , you love , you love to be a teacher , a banker , to be a mother , you just love another and that gives you a buzz if you knew the buzz , when you stop the buzz , if the sums stop , who is it then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states &quot; wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; a question .
&quot; I am on the way out , late and she says , &quot; Mama , mag@@ st you play ? &quot;
and I want to say no more than I can tell me two things :
&quot; first , I have to say yes to anything and secondly , they did not call me &quot; estim@@ ating . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it does not call anyone more &quot; &quot; estimate &quot; . &quot; &quot;
when is that happening ?
&quot; I hate when I am Titan and my buzz , and here all changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; Mama , mag@@ st you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
this is nothing special .
&quot; we play and her sisters encounter this , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in the lon@@ eliness and lack of summ@@ ing , I can do nothing but to pay . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the land that I was shot , the marathon that I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists is sti@@ cky finger and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax , and the song in which it &apos;s getting rid of , or whatever the girl in &quot; &quot; Die Eis@@ len &quot; . &quot; &quot;
everywhere peace and simplicity is everywhere .
the air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that doesn &apos;t immediately , but it happened . &quot;
I feel it .
the sums comes slow .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
not the buzz but a buzz .
and now I feel like I would know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the buzz , the working environment , the titan@@ ium dioxide , that is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself using broad@@ casts and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real buzz . &quot;
the buzz is not a force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real sums of life depends on love .
&quot; the buzz is the river , which comes from the pleasure of life . &quot;
the real sums is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the genuine buzz ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the necessary tasks , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real sums is simple and original .
&quot; the real sums of God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps whis@@ pered with God the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan . &quot;
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , a lot more love . &quot;
&quot; once my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
I do this as a rule so that I can free myself as a work@@ a@@ holic from any debt .
&quot; it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice unless I want to hear the buzz . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be as easy . I am not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; play is not close to me , how to work . &quot;
&quot; the truth does hurt , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
&quot; I am always working , because I love it . &quot;
I prefer working at the workplace as at home .
&quot; this entry is painful , because what kind of man works rather than being home ? &quot;
&quot; well , yes , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call me &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
&quot; that I am too relaxed , is none of them . &quot;
&quot; we slept in the garden , before and back , and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we break@@ up soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; yet , I feel mainly sti@@ ff , absent and confused . &quot;
I am always looking for my mobile phone .
yet it is o.@@ c .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the buzz of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we stopped playing with the games ?
you can also say it ! say they will always say yes if your child would like to play with you .
&quot; maybe you hold me for na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dream . &quot;
&quot; you are probably right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you also know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et @-@ Show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they carry out that they want something else . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a pupp@@ et or K@@ eks replaces me .
&quot; and speak my teen@@ ie @-@ daughter all 15 minutes long with me , I am mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more needs it . &quot;
everyone can get 15 minutes a bit even at a bad mood day !
15 minutes on the piece !
&quot; no mobile , no laundry , no laundry . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are praying . &quot;
but 15 minutes are inside !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is true to feel the buzz to have a place for his soul peace . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not about playing with their own children . it is about joy , &quot;
to the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find it out and keep it yourself .
&quot; I am not perfect in it . I sk@@ ate and I wins . friends meet , reading books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; stands for everything I have given up , when I got my first TV show , when I got a Titan in the training , when I wanted to exceed myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes per piece - why not take full 15 minutes to treat yourself ?
what can it be wrong ? nothing !
the buzz back in my spare time . the sums seems to return if I am not working .
working does not work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months opens a door , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an un@@ familiar melody , she meets me and my soul . she re@@ direc@@ ts me to new ideas . I carry out it to the ful@@ lest and love my work . &quot;
&quot; I like the buzz , but I do not love it . &quot;
I do not need it .
I am not the buzz , the buzz is not I ... no more . &quot;
soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my buzz .
the sums of life .
the buzz of Love .
&quot; the sums of work is part of me , but just one part . and for this I am so grateful . &quot;
&quot; I am schn@@ u@@ ke , that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my skin fire is still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the more happier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more clear my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the buzz . the land that I sho@@ ok , the marathon that I run , the troops , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this buzz , the more this unusual , captiv@@ ating , naked and new feeling of life in me wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this buzz , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am author . I think things out , I get you back to life . &quot;
&quot; that belongs to the job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and more games .
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thanks beautiful .
I am neuro@@ surgery .
like most of my colleagues I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
&quot; I know how to change your life from a second to the other , after a serious stroke or a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ surgeon , it is very frustrating that the brain , unlike other bodily organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have an abi@@ ding , heavy disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I sur@@ geries functional neuro@@ surgical treatment .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by different surgical interventions .
&quot; surely they have heard of one of the most prominent , the &quot; &quot; Tie@@ fen@@ hir@@ n@@ stimulation &quot; . &quot; this im@@ pl@@ ated one electro@@ de deeply in the brain in order to influence the switching circles of the neur@@ ons so that neurological function improves . &quot;
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson &apos;s disease that l@@ acked under fierce tre@@ mb@@ ling and severe pain .
Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was leading Ober@@ doctor and worked in the emergency room day and night .
often I appreciated patients with skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma .
they must imagine that at the skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ mat@@ a the brain breaks the brain and increases the cran@@ ial pressure .
&quot; to save life , you have to l@@ essen the cran@@ ial pressure . &quot;
&quot; for this , one sometimes has to remove a part of cotton brain mass . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze ourselves with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass . &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; cells of a tissue item grow to grow , is comparable to very small children , which can be taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and environments to thri@@ ve . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it made Jean @-@ François .
this he saw under his micro@@ scope .
it was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
perhaps you still know from the bi@@ ologi@@ ans that stem cells are un@@ mature cells that can transform themselves into each cell type of the organism .
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells refra@@ ined differently .
they shared slowly and after a couple of weeks she even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but looked differently . &quot;
&quot; we needed long to understand , where they came . &quot;
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our grand@@ hir@@ n@@ rin@@ ist cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of fet@@ us they ensure the f@@ ission of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know that .
&quot; we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain , as we find it close to brain injury . &quot;
this is not so secure .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
&quot; we stand in front of a potential cell source , which allows brain healing . &quot;
this we had to prove .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain from the non @-@ language area and then cultivate the cells exactly as they did Jean @-@ François
and they then put it in colour to be able to pursue them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we cut it on to the subject of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ ologist transp@@ l@@ ant -- auto transp@@ l@@ ant .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we are contempl@@ ating these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we grow the same cells in har@@ med brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkeys .
&quot; in the first scenario , we checked the cells into a healthy brain , and we watched them completely disappeared after several weeks as if they were removed again , they go back home . the room is already occupied , so they will not disappear . &quot;
in the second scenario we used to be an injury and un@@ equ@@ alled exactly the same cells and now the cells have gotten -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were not pl@@ ated .
&quot; evidence that they show are these small points . these are the cells , which we used in vit@@ ro , in the culture . &quot;
here we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
&quot; so , we are tra@@ ded monkeys with a manual de@@ fici@@ ality task . &quot;
they had to take food pel@@ lets from a tra@@ y .
they did that very well .
&quot; when they had reached a stable skill level , we dec@@ eive the mot@@ echnology sector in the mot@@ oric Cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; after that , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move her hand anymore . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen to people , they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of sculp@@ tural brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just as with the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were sure the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left you see the monkey , which spontaneously recovered . &quot;
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury to injury .
he is not as accurate and not so fast .
&quot; now , let &apos;s see the cells being weak : the same monkey , two months after the im@@ plantation . &quot;
I can tell you that were very exciting results for us too .
since that time we found a lot more about these cells .
we can free@@ ze it and use later .
&quot; we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example with Park@@ inson . &quot;
&quot; however , our dream is still to im@@ pl@@ ate them in humans . &quot;
&quot; I really hope that I can show you soon , how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself . &quot;
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , which is wonderful , I &apos;m sure now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who need it . &quot;
I will definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on the human being . &quot;
Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the greatest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies .
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : check out the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can get to the hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : this is hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study . &quot;
will it allow us to allow the authority to launch it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it needs a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate if it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply it to a multi@@ centric study .
one must first really prove that it is useful before one can offer this treatment to anyone .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as natural .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality , but as the inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as an imm@@ utable conscience .
we believe that capitalism leads inevitably to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his big dessert in Beijing have proved without doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy over@@ comes with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I re@@ presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear to me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group -- our choices -- not to influence the austerity programs that have been realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my out@@ going friends , told me that democracy would be abolished if they would change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to present an economic model for true democracy .
&quot; I ask you , along with me again to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save the democracy , but that we need a true and nasty democracy . &quot;
&quot; without democracy our societies are becoming one , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies wasted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction , which currently threatens our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; twin &quot; Par@@ adox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain , which thro@@ ws its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the debt mountain , &quot;
but few recognize its Gem@@ ini .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash that belongs to the high savings and affiliated corporations , which could however be too anxious where it could contribute productive and income , with which you could carry the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past 3 months , in the U.S. , in England and in the euro area , 3.4 tri@@ llion dollars has invested in all the wealth of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , streets , tracks , gear , and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 tri@@ llion US dollars is going to be much money until you compare it with the 5.@@ 1 tri@@ llion dollars , which at the same time mat@@ ured in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except the stock exchange and the real estate prices are ex@@ or@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; thus , debts and non @-@ productivity capital form the twin summit , which do not affect the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than a quarter of 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , which , in which they do not invest . just like Ö@@ di@@ pus Father , who is out of fear , the prophecy of the O@@ ra@@ k@@ le could be true that his son would kill him if he will grow , &quot;
un@@ explored the circumstances which lead to it that o@@ edi@@ pus kill him k@@ ills .
this is my ha@@ sten with capitalism --
&quot; his extremely productive art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to further develop our lives , develop human talents , and to finance all of the technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
I believe already . but before we continue : what do we understand by democracy ?
&quot; Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the company form , in which the air and the poor control the government as a majority . &quot;
the ath@@ ic democracy of course closed too many --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be an error , the significance of the ath@@ ic democracy due to these out@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor in the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy was and is that they were involved in the working arms , and not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they gave them the right to political cooperation with equal voting rights in questions of the state . &quot;
Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not kept long --
&quot; like a candle , which shines very bright , it is also quickly hidden . &quot;
&quot; however , our liberal liberal democracies do not have their roots in the ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the ath@@ ic democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy had only come up , as a complete separation from politics and economy , and the democratic process was put on politics , while the economy - the world of corporations - a democratic @-@ free zone was established . &quot;
&quot; in our present democracies , there has been a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two in which this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two , while the economy gradually desc@@ ended the politics . &quot;
wonder why the politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not due to a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because that one cannot be in the government today and nevertheless not in power because the power of politics is migr@@ ated into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my ha@@ ste with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is about as much as a herd of carni@@ vor@@ es that nour@@ ishes so sustainable the animals , of which it nour@@ ishes , dec@@ im@@ ated that they are star@@ ving at the end . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to the economy that has imposed politics so far too . the power of corporations grows , political goods will be de@@ valu@@ ated , the overall economic demand falls and the management of corporations are frightened to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism sells the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human labour @-@ power and prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we need to bring politics and the economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; reserves the control , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
this is not a new idea by the way .
the Mar@@ xi@@ an left had this idea already 100 years ago and it didn &apos;t seem to be good .
the teaching from the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor re@@ attain a position as in the ancient Athens without creating new kinds of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is one solution : creating the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing Ni@@ ed@@ ri@@ glo@@ ws through automation and robots .
&quot; the problem with this is , as long economy and politics are separate areas , the automation of the twin summit will be higher , the wast@@ age , and social conflicts deeper , as it may be -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we need to re@@ construct the economy and re@@ unite the areas of business and politics , and to ensure that we will find the re@@ united area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that lets the film &quot; matrix &quot; like a documentary . &quot;
&quot; the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements that he has produced , survive -- &quot;
&quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; matrix &quot; , or through something that will serve the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; A@@ gora , &quot; in long talks to the meaning of life . &quot;
&quot; I believe , we must be optimistic . &quot;
&quot; so , what might it be , how could it look to have this &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia rather than the &quot; matrix &quot; like similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation I would like to give you , in all short , some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the company : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you are working and in which your capital is working to you from a work@@ site to the next , and the company -- no matter what you currently works -- is owned by those who currently work in the company . &quot;
&quot; then all incomes come from capital and revenue , and the concept of wage work is completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but who do not work in it , and employee who work there , however , no longer between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no longer ra@@ ging twin summit . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy : please introduce yourselves to that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of 20 largest emerging markets &#93; , in the interests of all of humanity . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the Cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos , &quot; -- and every government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade fe@@ eder of the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund is invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment means are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
&quot; it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference proposed by 1944 . &quot;
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today we have them , especially in the background of a re@@ united politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe you is at the same time liber@@ ators , in which they pre@@ fers privileged people , and Marxist , because it is buried the separation of capital and labour in the trash of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ ally , global key@@ n@@ esi@@ ally . &quot;
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we work together politically .
&quot; it is in our hands , and we are doing it better . &quot;
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marxists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for re@@ unification of politics and business is ... do we not do this , technological development will produce such a massive decline in overall economic demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers describes as &quot; long @-@ term st@@ agnation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the transfer of this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next , as we are experiencing it up to date , it will not only destabili@@ ze our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liber@@ alism is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is correct , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; just like Hay@@ ek , which is why I am a liber@@ t@@ ary Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and therefore I am completely wir@@ elessly . &quot;
&quot; BG : in fact , and now we are well . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you do not forget , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the Red@@ ner , you have very clearly said what you keep away from the sight of the West to China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democracies we have the semb@@ lance of a democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited the democracy to politics during the area , where most of them play , -- the area of economics -- a fully democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some respects , if I may say that so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is today similar to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
for -- you remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that &apos;s a mistake .
liber@@ alism and liber@@ als like John Stu@@ art Mill --
&quot; he was particularly skep@@ tical , which affects the democratic development . &quot;
&quot; what can be observed now in China , resembles very the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; now to blame China now , that has done what the West has done in the 19th century , has a tremendous amount of hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
&quot; BG : I &apos;m sure that many list@@ eners are curious about your experiences as Minister of Finance , beginning of the year . &quot;
Y@@ V : I did that it comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half @-@ year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very disappointing , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone . &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely to adopt us from self @-@ suffici@@ ency , and the perpet@@ ual denial that a massive decline in the euro area ran , and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- on the way , the first proposal was that this denial was revealed -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro zone , within the European group , continues to deny the denial . &quot;
&quot; however , you know what comes . &quot;
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries an economic system that is not viable to receive life through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , it will be able to delay it a while , but when changes occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you look ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have any future if we do not change their construction .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everybody who looks back -- seriousness ...
&quot; if there is a Finance Minister , or anyone who gives a minister who claims after 6 months in office , especially in such tense situation , it claims that he has no mistake , then that is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the biggest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the end of February during the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest concern on the sides of the don@@ or to find a common solution .
but that was not .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government a case , just because they did not want to deal with the ver@@ ts that ran through the Eurozone . &quot;
they did not want to conce@@ de that they have been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
none of the tro@@ ika creditors imposed on us that policy has imposed us and one : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : in spite of all this , and despite the aggressive push of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
&quot; for if they have not survived , the free flow forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not be disastrous for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to hit the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what it appears to me , it will be as well toler@@ able for the future of Europeans and the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thanks .
&quot; from Roy Price , most of them have never heard , although it is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for much of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is Vice @-@ employed at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the TV @-@ production company of Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an icon and describes itself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
&quot; Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible for the shows and the content to share the Amazon . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy can not select any one .
&quot; he must find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are on the right at this corner . &quot;
this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the site IM@@ D@@ b . the review goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review received .
&quot; will show your show with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; &quot; Bre@@ aking bath , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that addic@@ ted , where , after having looked at a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left hand side , here at this end , shows how &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- -- that &apos;s enough to tell you what happens at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve , because I think you have already need special intelligence to submit &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts on average explo@@ iters , the average television -- the shows , which are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t delight . &quot;
so he must make sure he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is available and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing something , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk . &quot;
he wants to create success .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses for a evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can watch everyone for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon turns out in vain things , it is possible to attack correctly ? &quot;
millions of spectators look out these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they will be observed at the check of these shows . &quot;
they are observed by Roy and his team that will accommodate everything .
&quot; you record when you start the show , when you look for , which parts you can skip or look again . &quot;
&quot; you collect millions of data to decide on these data , which show them should produce . &quot;
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process these and from it results the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they did this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it doesn &apos;t seem that many of them can remember this show because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve 7,@@ 4 amounts and Alpha House landed at 7,5 -- i.e. something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; at the same time with another company , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the Manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of organising a competition , he and his team looked at the available data via the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the reviews they give the shows , their course , what shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use these data to find out these little details about the viewer : what shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all these parts together , they went a Wag@@ try and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed in such a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards , receives a 9.@@ 1 rating on this corner . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot;
&quot; of course , is the question : what has happened here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very competitive , data sealed companies . &quot;
&quot; you connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that this should work with everything .
&quot; when you collect millions of data for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statisti@@ c as back @-@ up .
you can be optimized by very powerful computers .
&quot; the mines , what you can expect is good TV , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis is not working so this is a little fri@@ ghtening because we live in a time , in which we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does someone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; nobody . OK , this is even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room will ever touch in touch with this software . come in touch , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in prison here in the USA and ask for discharge , it is likely that data analysis is used in this company to determine whether a dis@@ mis@@ sal is made or not . &quot;
&quot; just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence for this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always generated the best results . this is not because a company such as multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
even the data of sealed companies are sometimes wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that they can pre@@ dict by data analysis bur@@ sts of flu , of vi@@ cious way -- through data analysis of the Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderfully well and was a great news sensation . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked properly , year round year , until it suddenly no longer worked , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data of sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; in spite of all these errors influ@@ encing data in decisions of life - at the workplace , in the legal framework , in medicine . &quot;
&quot; so , we should rather ensure that data is helpful . &quot;
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ based genetics -- an area where some very smart people uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able to use many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a medication . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be distributed .
&quot; if you need to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; as a first , you dis@@ integrate this problem into its parts , so you can analyze the items ; as a wide @-@ wide you put the items back together to hold a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help create a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to put together the parts back and then come to a decision .
&quot; for this , there is another tool and we all possess it : our brain . &quot;
&quot; if there is something that the brain is good , it is parts and pieces together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to then get a good idea -- especially when it is a brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I believe that Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , why otherwise they wouldn &apos;t have been able to get together again and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; which did not stand in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for that show which meant they went a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they selected for TV ideas , then when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are only one tool and to not forget that , this device is rather useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ az@@ or no question you only need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely , &quot; - right here at this moment . &quot;
I will return it later with a techni@@ cian .
&quot; so far , I have made some decisions in my life so far as I should have listened to the ball . &quot;
&quot; but , as you of course know if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by something much compensation , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; perhaps the ball is wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging message that it still pays off to make decisions , an expert in which you do , and to respond to risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thanks beautiful .
