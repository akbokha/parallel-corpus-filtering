<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">Perhaps you know him maybe because he won the Pulitzer Prize in the New York Times-Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before anyone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book, in which he published spectacular that the NSA heard illegal phones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA had literally over drafts for an atomic bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter did not fall at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has established on Risen and called on it to call its alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this move, he became a symbol for the pattern of government, whistleblower to condemn and repitching journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional Treaty, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right if media cannot get this information, and if the identity of the mute can not protect them."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government was anchoring up, he did something that many courageous reporters already did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, only days before the process, something exceptional."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they had been left for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government on pensions were dropped."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason: in the period of electronic surveillance, the Reporter and the sources can hide themselves less and less."</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of failing and pushing for statements, this could also do his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigator, without his consent, his telephone calls are secretly concerned,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, his loans, and even rice-wise with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-whistle-blower and risens supposed to be condemned."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblower to protect. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too far from their work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistle-blower to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"we therefore put the press in the game that is to be protected by the first constitutional record, because the government has more possibilities to raise all of them."</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, just as technology of the government allows to use the rights of reporters, the press may also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and indeed, they can contact the moment in which they contact, rather than in retrospect."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software, which has not yet been written when Risen had written his book and it is much safer than normal e-mail or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmitter system for whistleblower, originally developed by the Internet famous, which was originally developed by us, Aaron Swartz, and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I work."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news website, such as the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send documents, just as in any ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server which only has the relevant message agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot provide more information secretly, and many of the information they would demand would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">"SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole, to protect the press freedom in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spection technologies that may endanger us all."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is to make sure that not only technology look like Edward Snowden have a chance to make misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"who knows about abuses during the supply of soldiers and tell about crowded hospitals. or the next environmental staff, the alarm for contaminated water from Flint proposes. or a Wallstreet insider, who warned us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover the crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">"[on 3 April 2016 the largest data leck of the story was published.] [the" Panama Papers "reveal that empires and powers are hidden from Global Witness by Global Witness.] [what does this mean?] [we bate Robert Palmer from Global Witness to an explanation.] this week we were interviewed by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the offshore law firm Moszca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the Secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we will get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers are going to companies such as Mosque Fonseca and say," okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up it? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works, as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"also, there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has a tax-Assad in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars led to Russia's President Vladimir Putin, a close friend of children, a famous cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are waiting to wait for the next release, and to the next revealed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems cries away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we address this?</seg>
<seg id="54">"the truth is, if the rich and powerful is able to hide their assets in tax havens and not to pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"throughout the world, media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax havens are used by some of them to hide their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing it for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people will see this whole world very confusing, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens function."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so one has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for prosecutions and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to understand what matters is."</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">"probably because there were no prominent Americans now, which occurred in these revelations."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now, it is not that there are no rich Americans to hide their assets in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"but through the principle, after which these tax havens function, Mospe Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we would have a data leck of the Cayman Islands or Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see a lot more cases and examples to have ties to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that in some US states less information is necessary to provide less information to start a company than to get a librarian."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US allowed it to zoom employees from school.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has frauds allowed to zoom especially appealing investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does that work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a capped investigator into the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator provided itself as an African Minister, who wanted to bring suspected money to the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"we really shoved it that all up to an attorney made by our investigator, how he could transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all precursors. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course no one was handed over to money to anybody. but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as a single case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted to our capped investigations.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single leading policymakers, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we need to change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very dull, as if we could not do anything against it, as if nothing had ever changed, as if it will always be the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as a born optimist, I really see that quite a lot has started to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen demonstrations to more transparency, which concerns the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">"the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in 2013, in Northern Ireland."</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU is based in central regulators at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe, and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama's revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people who become angry when they see, how other people can hide their true identity behind the headland."</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need managers in the economy, who stand up and say," Intransparent is not good for business. "</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "we need leading politicians to recognize the problem and use it to end through laws this kind of transparency."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can end the intransparence, which now allows these kinds of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering, finally end."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I had almost kidnapped and in the trunk of a red mains."</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I finished my design studies, I did a backon sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy got up in the red Mazda and looked at my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my art works.</seg>
<seg id="100">"he was alone in the city, and just made a roadtrip all over the country. after that, he would go to peace corps."</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I became tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him," Where do you sleep tonight? "</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says that he would go to peace skorps, but I don't know if he really is planning. I will not abducted in the trunk of a Mazar!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself saying: "I have an air-rats. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," "h, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was in bed, I stared in the blanket and thought:" Oh man! what did I get to the broken? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild alien sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I got out of bed, on toe pointed at the door, and my sleep door closed."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork that he had bought from me today depends on his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps people who were sold to me in childhood as foreigners, actually friends, who only waited for it?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"to accommodate people on my airbed, it was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air rats."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's take a time, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost bankite, my roommate draws up and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I believe, creativity can make it, be afraid to turn into fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I thought how we could earn something about it. our apartment is equipped with a designer bed and breakfast. young designers are able to stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air-rats and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happiest guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on a wooden floor in wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">"they found it super, and we also found it."</seg>
<seg id="132">"I am sure our cheese ham Omeletts tasted completely different, because we made them for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest, and the door to the castle fell, rigidly Brian and me."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent at the same time?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into the roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether you could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented our Investors:" we would like to create a website, on which people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors you close by. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">"indeed, they do not."</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still in comfort, would invest in a business, the stranger allowed to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children have all learned that foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you have the things that you can do well. we were able to design."</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and aptics -- it is the overall experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create through design immense trust between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design be able to do something?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create confidence with design trust?</seg>
<seg id="151">"I would like to give you a precious sample, what degree trust we did."</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfortzone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">"now, I would like to unlock your mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="156">Type your entlockable mobile phone from your left sitting hand.</seg>
<seg id="157">"this quietly junction of panic, which you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts are feeling when they open the door for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="158">"for the only thing is more personal than your mobile phone, your home is home."</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, you can see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the steered cell phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"so, most guests feel when they are elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"only once, who has now Al Gores mobile phone?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you proclaim to Twitter that he complies for the president of the president?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail at this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor had presented only once with his name; if he had told how he comes, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"imagine, you would have 150 covers, which are all saying:" "he can really hold very well-eliminated mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you would have to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well arranged feedback system strengthens confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">"it was hard for people, negative assessments."</seg>
<seg id="175">"in the end, we decided to wait until both host and guest provided their assessments before we put them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new discovered.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are at age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly we trust the people most who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social lecture.</seg>
<seg id="181">This is exciting when one adds to the call of a person -- in our case by judgment.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three assessments, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but one has more than ten, changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stiff common.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can therefore help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preference.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you can see from yourself."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"when you tell too little about how" "hi!", "you do not get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells you much, as for example:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request will not be accepted too."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." "Tolle artworks in your apartment! I do with my family holiday."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="194">"what we had not expected, was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">Firstly: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">"second, the tireless work of our team."</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, if required, which was not covered before."</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business runs very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything is smooth."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have rude parties or devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">"there is nothing fulimmerit as these calls. it already hurts, if I just think."</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the callers, was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million tons of nights had only a fraction of the problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">"if confidence works, it can be something wonderful."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host took him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even spout blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travellers looking for sitting activities to heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real protections, which can save one life, even though they don't even know each other."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they do not want you to feel lonely, they bring books by."</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even leave a longer without the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So of course does not work every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money-action are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled about this term for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with monetary transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is here an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but it is now simply called" "rental industry", "the thing will not do justice."</seg>
<seg id="228">"share Economy describes a trade, which promises human relationships."</seg>
<seg id="229">Humans place a part of themselves openly and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel today, it is to compare to fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but it is less authentically."</seg>
<seg id="231">"what would be, however, if travelling a rich buffet from local impressions would be?"</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if at any place you have visited, a group there would be Ansässiger to wait for a thorough and show one in a bar-pentagon quarter of which one has never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to design apartments from scratch on the other side?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would share the thoughts of a common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships, instead of loneliness and depreciation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korean capital Seoul, this project has already begun. a lot of parking that belonged to the government."</seg>
<seg id="240">"they were offered by the inhabitants. students, who were in search of a place,"</seg>
<seg id="241">"were introduced to people whose children were moved. there were incubator programs,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"in order to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy, our platform alone today will be 785 000 people in 191 countries at a foreign or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to not be so crazy about how it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">"hospitality, there were also previously."</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has just our works?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome profound prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I find this amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda is passing by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We of course know that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"subjected to indoctrination, a terrorist"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the safety check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study revealed that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not talk to their hamber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for those who have never met a Muslim, it is great to meet you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I say to you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee maker -- doubling espresso, with cream."</seg>
<seg id="270">I am both introverted</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtecher-Fitness-Fanatikerin</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual muscle."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga, because, baby, I was not so born."</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old I decided to outing me.</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to carry my headgear."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why are you oppressed yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the Funny was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, and in contrast to the pressure I felt as 17-year old, to suit me a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have accepted not only passive belief in my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have to do with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, was asked, asked, and ultimately believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was confidence and slow-surrender which deepened with any reading of the corridor.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"did you ever feel that someone perceives you, you fully understand, and yet somehow loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels that way.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and began, like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later I had, after my marriage, a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that awful morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I was sitting in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked on the screen and looked at the word" "Eilderegistration". ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, planes flew in buildings, people spears out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock was changed rapidly in outrage.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I joined the TV channel and heard"... "Muslim terrorists"... "..." in the name of Islam... "..."... "..."... "..." bombed Mecca! "</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it has not only been attacked my country, but in Nu consulted me the deeds of others from a civil war into an suspects."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Middle West of the United States to move into a new city and start with a postgraduate course."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I drove me -- when we were silent -- so deep it went out into my seat, and I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved into our apartment at night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then heard, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said," be watchful, "" Seid wary, "" lead in well illuminated areas "," Versammmelt not you. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday during that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal. "</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who held out for Muslims, and struck me free."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who have attacked this land have attacked our land.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have drawn the anger of people to terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love issues."</seg>
<seg id="319">There are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"nowadays, we can actually say people:" there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims. "</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go on? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslim and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor can be seen as a whole and a benign tumor only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the US, but a life-important organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, instructors and Olympiad."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques are more secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">"maybe there will be some parking available, but not stop the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit to a mosque leads to consider people other belief tolerant, and greater civil participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a head of the police in the Washington D.C., DC recently told: people are actually not radical in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"when the radicalization process has been determined that it starts off online. as a first, the person is cut off from their church, that the extremes will cause the true Muslims, and anyone who despises their behavior and its ideology is a traitor, or of faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we need to stop the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still assert that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Eventually a group like the IS reveals its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a person, I think we must do everything to stop a group such as the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">"but we would add ourselves to their imagination, if you acknowledge them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers."</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when one casts a look at it, it is not pushing them what they are in their" Holy Scripture. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that let them read these things in Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An excellent imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she had imagined to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was exactly the opposite. every spiritual, with whom she had spoken, she brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that had given purpose to their anger, it was a main target for the instrumalization by extremists who promised her a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam gave the connection to God and her church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what they learned in the mosque, they kept to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">It was an insight to how the Islamophobia and my family is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affects our democracy every day on our thoughts of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- when we fear that at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we accept rather an authoritarian government system, conformance and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows: if you have reports to test messages, in which negative information was reported on Muslims, they would rather have military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just a academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look, when the mood against Muslims downlap -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in the context of terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened before the war of Iraq and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"thus, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Moslem-terror as I expected."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public to eradicate the foundation of a free society, the rational and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Moslems is an early warning.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it perhaps the first, but the toxic air of fear leads us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"in the assignment of collective innocence, it is not only about to explain itself to itself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was at the dental Faculty, talented, much promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would say to me that he was the sweetest, generous man, whom she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when has come from my brotherhood, such a sealed young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne in her brother and his wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was assassinated, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan that was on the afternoon to visit. he did it in her apartment, as with a execution, after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="376">He died eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be immoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Have we gone to the mosque or stayed safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we besought it and for us it was not an easy decision, for it was about which America we want to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the Kindersitz, we drove silent, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, and my shoes went out, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw, let me stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked his guests, because half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who have come to attack us, but to teach us."</seg>
<seg id="387">In that moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion and prejudiced prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be sure to number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join to those who mean: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thanks beautiful!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia you seem to have met a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">"but I ask myself, what do you say that you might say that you are holding an TEDTalk, working a thinker with draught, so an exception and not the rule."</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>

<seg id="407">"what started as a platform for crafting, is about to be a billionaire business."</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial threats. this is made possible in research facilities worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air parcel transfer into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Frac Centre in France has built a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. a few years ago they started to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">By interlocking flight devices high speed and acceleration in the narrowest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-constantly moving structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to wear burdens, deal with turbulence, and generally respond to natural laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">"today, we would like to show you some of our new projects."</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the Possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"so that a system works autonomously, it must be collective envy where in the room the mobile objects are located."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects. that enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamical tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, an offences of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, computations on board, what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands exist on the highest level, e.g." "start" "and land."</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called Heckstarter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">"a leaflet, which tries to beat two flies with a cap."</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient in the forward-upward flight, much more efficient as the helicopter in all their variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most starters, it can float outside, and thus has a great advantage in the start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of hits is that they are sensitive on turbulence such as wind arches.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the air device doesn't matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research we often present basic abstract questions that are at the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the petty-possible number of movables for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are about to be known as machines with a thousand movable parts that join forces to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago skilled pilots were able to fly remote-controlled air devices that had only two movable parts: a propeller and a tailgate.</seg>
<seg id="435">"long ago, we discovered that flying with only one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monoinner, the mechanically easiest drifting device. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only a movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no clap, hinges and cross-rups, no further footprint or controversies, only a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, happening in the interior live very much so that it can fly stable and move into space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tailgate. to bring it to flying, I need to throw it correctly."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood to throw it right, if all of me is low, therefore I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"when the monhinner is an exercise in happiness, this machine is here, the omkopter with its eight propellors, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"as a result, he receives the proper ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"move into space in all directions, no matter which direction it is rotated or even as it rotates."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers, of the eight propane."</seg>
<seg id="449">"a lot is adjustable in models, the rest will learn directly at the fly."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see this again.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and secure."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate twin-propellers.</seg>
<seg id="453">This is about a clockwise direction</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise direction.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine even if limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that by half a flight.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration are investigated synthetic swarming.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the crude number of autonomous, co-ordinated units offers a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took wholesale micro-quadcopter -- each one weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equip them with local technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The especially safe machine there is to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">For guys like us the pay is in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a memory, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it is creative, clever creatures allowed to form them in such a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such solid commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="469">"1,3 billion years ago surrounded by two black holes in a very far remote Galaxy two black holes one another ever faster, they turned into a tenth of the crowd in a tenth point in a tenth of a tighter."</seg>
<seg id="470">This short time shredded them brighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the whole of us known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very great bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But their energy did not put it in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy has been given into the space-time texture itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>

<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago the majority of life on earth was being created.</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then, the Earth has produced things: corals, fish, plants, saur, people and -- God stand with us -- even the internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"approximately 25 years ago, a group specifically decided -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from the Caltech -- to search for gravitational-waves that arise about colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">"but enough people realized them as a crazy genius, so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed their idea."</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, construction, conception and extremely hard work they built the Detector LIGO: the laser-Interferometer - gravitational-waves observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the follow-up time, the precision of LIGO could greatly increase what the recognition performance could be enormous."</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, LIGO was launched for a last test run to clarify some minor, stubborn problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the departure from my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">"all that, for what I had worked, is no longer Science Fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicists at MIT. he has examined for 23 years of gravitational-waves from black holes and their by observatory such as LIGO measurable signals. what are gravitational-waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a cabling in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"by passing the wave, the space and its entire content is stretched in a direction and stretched into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"to illustrative faculty, teachers in courses of relativity-theory often lead a really good dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on 14 September, for example, each one was stretched out of the waves at the ascending of the waves and gestures. the stretching of an average man was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that means 20 Nulls after the comma, followed by a 1 Darum, one declared the LIGO employee for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometres long laser detector, which is already absurd, this length would have to be measured on less than a 1000th of the radius of a nuclear fight. that's grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text over gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder Ligos, hunting for the waves in the following way:" the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"physicists are dark, and with the support of the public will certainly all obstacles be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne has published this in 1973 for 42 years prior to its success.</seg>
<seg id="505">"back to LIGO. Scott maintains, LIGO is more than an eye than an eye."</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facial extracts, the size of your cell phone. "</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical. for this way you can make a picture or a map of things by taking advantage of the light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">In sounds it is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things that mean to you especially much:"</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child approximately.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain properties like clay and height, rhythm and volume, to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, it is talking straight Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob underbreaks them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"duous Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make them easy pictures of objects in space.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by reading changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for LIGO are the measured frequencies in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we convert wave patterns to Schall, we can literally speak the universe."</seg>
<seg id="522">"the gravity of laughing can give us about much about the collision of two black holes, so my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotate holes, circular simple: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">The two bodies are turning very fast, you hear the same circle with an additional tonic change. that sounds like Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu! "</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement that shapes in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard LIGO Folding: [Surrendes sound] jemand, who knows what he needs to hear, this recognizes as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with the 30-fold sun mass, which turn around as fast as the sticks of your mixers."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's just think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the dense body in space, one with a mass of 29 Sonnen, the other with a mass of 36 probe, orbit each one hundred times per second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces in front of you.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the abiding meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO paves a completely new way to study the alls as it was never possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this road we can hear the universe and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can -- practical or basically -- not to see.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a super-nova, for example. I would like to know why mashed stars in Supernovae explode."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about the space.</seg>
<seg id="538">"the exciting physical operations occur however, at the core, which is hidden behind thousand kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see you as these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational-waves penetrate iron, as if it would be more transparent glass. the Urbang. I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it as the judgment is covered through his / her own lighting."</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">"and that is most important: I am FEELING that in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen before, and of which we have no idea of which we can only discover, by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, LIGO found right in the first attempt to do things that we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: me: the type of stars, the black holes emerge, like LIGO they observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. black holes are so to say the subules for our archeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"LIGO provides us with a completely different angle of view on the events of space, in the emergence of the stars, and ultimately as we came out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now exists to be as brave as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks LIGO we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new Observatory -- a whole new generation of Observatories in Earth and All.</seg>
<seg id="550">Because what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">A while ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"for a year I would say to all" "Yes!" "before which I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="556">"whether it made me nervous to me in unpleasant situations, I forced me" "yes". ""</seg>

<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">Would I start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, but yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">And a mad thing happened: exactly what I was afraid of when I was afraid to eliminate my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear, speeches to hold, my social fear -- Puff, weg."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes, my life changed."</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," changed me. "</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain Yes, which my life deeply changed, on an unexpected art. it started with a question of my youngest."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for inexplicable reasons all" estimating ";"</seg>

<seg id="572">"she asked me once I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>

<seg id="575">"almost. I am not perfect, but I am trying."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, to my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an intriguing side effect: only recently I understood actually that the "yes" Sagen to play with my children my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am author. I think things out, get you down to life."</seg>

<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">"every shipment offers hundreds of jobs, which previously did not exist."</seg>

<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it, because I know what you think when the word" "author" "falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I say to you all of you who work so hard, whether you're planning a company, a country or a classroom, take me seriously if I speak of work, so you understand that I am not only at the computer tore and imaginative, and it's true when I say, I understand that it is not about dreaming at a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, everything reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I am absorbed into the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's like when I set troops on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">"so called a high tone, lying a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, strenuous and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzz starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy street, I could always drive on it."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people take when I declare them the buzz that I am writing writing, that writing is my pleasure."</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the buzz -- when I started with television production, when I began to work and work, build and work together, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy. the buzz!"</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a buzz, then you cannot be different from size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feel, not to be different than to strive for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is what you call the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I know only that I am not made for failure, and I just know I love the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I will only say to you, I am a Titan, and I know that I will not ask it into question."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make a clear one: the more successful I will, the more outcomes, the more survival there is, the more things are there, the more things I write history, the more my expectations there is."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what do I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, not true?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land which I shout, the marathon, which I run, the army, the high sound, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then stopped the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, overpowered, exaggerated, hidden."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">"now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth, that her mother is a single worker."</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my mom will not be there, but you can write my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says," Behold, I want to go to Shonda land. "</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of a titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are Baby-Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the buzz heard."</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzz of the engine was petrified.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not love my job any more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I did the same things as always: the same titans work, 15 hours-days, completed weekends, no remores, nothing delegate, a Titan sleeps, does not exist, with full heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was an indication-Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do, if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know, some may think:" "Heul You from, Blessed author-Titan." ""</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you do, you love, you love to be a teacher, a banker, to be a mother, you just love another and that gives you a buzz if you knew the buzz, when you stop the buzz, if the sums stop, who is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart stops, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states" waitress "a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way out, late and she says," Mama, magst you play? "</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no more than I can tell me two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say yes to anything and secondly, they did not call me" estimating. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"it does not call anyone more" "estimate". ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When is that happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I hate when I am Titan and my buzz, and here all changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," Mama, magst you play? "</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and her sisters encounter this, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops "." "</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and lack of summing, I can do nothing but to pay."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the land that I was shot, the marathon that I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists is sticky finger and humid kisses, delicate voices, wax, and the song in which it's getting rid of, or whatever the girl in" "Die Eislen". ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere peace and simplicity is everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that doesn't immediately, but it happened."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums comes slow.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzz but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the buzz, the working environment, the titanium dioxide, that is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe myself using broadcasts and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz."</seg>
<seg id="707">The buzz is not a force and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums of life depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">"the buzz is the river, which comes from the pleasure of life."</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the genuine buzz ignores the pressure of history, the necessary tasks, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real sums of God's voice in my ear, but perhaps whispered with God the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, a lot more love. "</seg>
<seg id="717">"once my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule so that I can free myself as a workaholic from any debt.</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no choice. I have no choice unless I want to hear the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be as easy. I am not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">"play is not close to me, how to work."</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth does hurt,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">"I am always working, because I love it."</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at the workplace as at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this entry is painful, because what kind of man works rather than being home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, yes, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call me" "Titan" "--"</seg>

<seg id="737">Yet it is o.c.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the buzz of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we stopped playing with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! say they will always say yes if your child would like to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you hold me for naïve, for a daydream."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you are probably right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you also know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet-Show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes, until they carry out that they want something else."</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>

<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more needs it."</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can get 15 minutes a bit even at a bad mood day!</seg>

<seg id="754">"no mobile, no laundry, no laundry."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children are praying."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is true to feel the buzz to have a place for his soul peace."</seg>
<seg id="758">"it's not about playing with their own children. it is about joy,"</seg>

<seg id="763">"I am not perfect in it. I skate and I wins. friends meet, reading books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" stands for everything I have given up, when I got my first TV show, when I got a Titan in the training, when I wanted to exceed myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes per piece - why not take full 15 minutes to treat yourself?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can it be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz back in my spare time. the sums seems to return if I am not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months opens a door, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unfamiliar melody, she meets me and my soul. she redirects me to new ideas. I carry out it to the fullest and love my work."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the buzz, but I do not love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>

<seg id="778">"I am schnuke, that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, the journey to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my skin fire is still burning.</seg>

<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how to change your life from a second to the other, after a serious stroke or a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeon, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodily organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have an abiding, heavy disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I surgeries functional neurosurgical treatment.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by different surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">"surely they have heard of one of the most prominent, the" "Tiefenhirnstimulation". "this implated one electrode deeply in the brain in order to influence the switching circles of the neurons so that neurological function improves."</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease that lacked under fierce trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was leading Oberdoctor and worked in the emergency room day and night.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I appreciated patients with skull-Hirn-trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that at the skull-Hirn-Traumata the brain breaks the brain and increases the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, you have to lessen the cranial pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">"for this, one sometimes has to remove a part of cotton brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze ourselves with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"cells of a tissue item grow to grow, is comparable to very small children, which can be taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it made Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">This he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">It was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unmature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the biologians that stem cells are unmature cells that can transform themselves into each cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells refrained differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They shared slowly and after a couple of weeks she even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but looked differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">"we needed long to understand, where they came."</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our grandhirnrinist cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of fetus they ensure the fission of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain, as we find it close to brain injury."</seg>
<seg id="847">This is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">"we stand in front of a potential cell source, which allows brain healing."</seg>
<seg id="850">This we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain from the non-language area and then cultivate the cells exactly as they did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then put it in colour to be able to pursue them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we cut it on to the subject of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist transplant -- auto transplant.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we are contemplating these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we grow the same cells in harmed brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario, we checked the cells into a healthy brain, and we watched them completely disappeared after several weeks as if they were removed again, they go back home. the room is already occupied, so they will not disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we used to be an injury and unequalled exactly the same cells and now the cells have gotten -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were not plated.</seg>
<seg id="862">"evidence that they show are these small points. these are the cells, which we used in vitro, in the culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">"so, we are traded monkeys with a manual deficiality task."</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did that very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they had reached a stable skill level, we deceive the motechnology sector in the motoric Cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"after that, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move her hand anymore."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen to people, they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of sculptural brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just as with the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were sure the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left you see the monkey, which spontaneously recovered."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not as accurate and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, let's see the cells being weak: the same monkey, two months after the implantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were very exciting results for us too.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use it in other neuropathological models, for example with Parkinson."</seg>
<seg id="881">"however, our dream is still to implate them in humans."</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope that I can show you soon, how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself."</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, which is wonderful, I'm sure now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who need it. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I will definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on the human being."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the greatest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: check out the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone can get to the hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical study."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to allow the authority to launch it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it needs a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate if it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply it to a multicentric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">One must first really prove that it is useful before one can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it."</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as natural.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality, but as the inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as an immutable conscience.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism leads inevitably to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his big dessert in Beijing have proved without doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy overcomes with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally clear to me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup -- our choices -- not to influence the austerity programs that have been realized in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my outgoing friends, told me that democracy would be abolished if they would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present an economic model for true democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, along with me again to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save the democracy, but that we need a true and nasty democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"without democracy our societies are becoming one, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction, which currently threatens our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin" Paradox. "</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain, which throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the debt mountain,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize its Gemini.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash that belongs to the high savings and affiliated corporations, which could however be too anxious where it could contribute productive and income, with which you could carry the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needed, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past 3 months, in the U.S., in England and in the euro area, 3.4 trillion dollars has invested in all the wealth of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, streets, tracks, gear, and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 trillion US dollars is going to be much money until you compare it with the 5.1 trillion dollars, which at the same time matured in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except the stock exchange and the real estate prices are exorised."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debts and non-productivity capital form the twin summit, which do not affect the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe are unemployed, which, in which they do not invest. just like Ödipus Father, who is out of fear, the prophecy of the Orakle could be true that his son would kill him if he will grow,"</seg>
<seg id="925">Unexplored the circumstances which lead to it that oedipus kill him kills.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hasten with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"his extremely productive art. all the unproductive capital should be used to further develop our lives, develop human talents, and to finance all of the technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I believe already. but before we continue: what do we understand by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">"Aristoteles defined democracy as the company form, in which the air and the poor control the government as a majority."</seg>
<seg id="931">The athic democracy of course closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be an error, the significance of the athic democracy due to these outsions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive factor in the athenic democracy was and is that they were involved in the working arms, and not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they gave them the right to political cooperation with equal voting rights in questions of the state."</seg>
<seg id="935">Athenian democracy has not kept long --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which shines very bright, it is also quickly hidden."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our liberal liberal democracies do not have their roots in the ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the athic democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy had only come up, as a complete separation from politics and economy, and the democratic process was put on politics, while the economy - the world of corporations - a democratic-free zone was established."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our present democracies, there has been a relentless struggle between the two in which this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two, while the economy gradually descended the politics."</seg>
<seg id="942">Wonder why the politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because that one cannot be in the government today and nevertheless not in power because the power of politics is migrated into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my haste with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is about as much as a herd of carnivores that nourishes so sustainable the animals, of which it nourishes, decimated that they are starving at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"it is similar to the economy that has imposed politics so far too. the power of corporations grows, political goods will be devaluated, the overall economic demand falls and the management of corporations are frightened to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism sells the" Demos "[the people] out of democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human labour-power and prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if this is true, it is obvious that we need to bring politics and the economy again, and it would be better if the" Demos "reserves the control, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea by the way.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxian left had this idea already 100 years ago and it didn't seem to be good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The teaching from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor reattain a position as in the ancient Athens without creating new kinds of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: creating the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing Niedriglows through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem with this is, as long economy and politics are separate areas, the automation of the twin summit will be higher, the wastage, and social conflicts deeper, as it may be -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we need to reconstruct the economy and reunite the areas of business and politics, and to ensure that we will find the reunited area, otherwise we end up in a pathological monitoring hyperautocracy that lets the film" matrix "like a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements that he has produced, survive --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in" matrix ", or through something that will serve the society in" Star Trek, "or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athener" Agora, "in long talks to the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">"I believe, we must be optimistic."</seg>
<seg id="960">"so, what might it be, how could it look to have this" star Trek "-like utopia rather than the" matrix "like similar dystopia?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation I would like to give you, in all short, some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of the company: please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you are working and in which your capital is working to you from a worksite to the next, and the company -- no matter what you currently works -- is owned by those who currently work in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then all incomes come from capital and revenue, and the concept of wage work is completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the companies, but who do not work in it, and employee who work there, however, no longer between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no longer raging twin summit."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy: please introduce yourselves to that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of 20 largest emerging markets], in the interests of all of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"furthermore, imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" the Cosmos, "in units of" Cosmos, "-- and every government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade feeder of the respective country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund is invested in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment means are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">"it is basically what John Maynard Keynes in the Bretton Woods Conference proposed by 1944."</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today we have them, especially in the background of a reunited politics and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe you is at the same time liberators, in which they prefers privileged people, and Marxist, because it is buried the separation of capital and labour in the trash of history, and keynesially, global keynesially."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we work together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">"it is in our hands, and we are doing it better."</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography itself as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I have just said, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for reunification of politics and business is... do we not do this, technological development will produce such a massive decline in overall economic demand, which Larry Summers describes as" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"through the transfer of this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next, as we are experiencing it up to date, it will not only destabilize our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberalism is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is correct, Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"just like Hayek, which is why I am a libertary Marxist, and as Keynes, and therefore I am completely wirelessly."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: in fact, and now we are well."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you do not forget, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually, it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the Redner, you have very clearly said what you keep away from the sight of the West to China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the semblance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited the democracy to politics during the area, where most of them play, -- the area of economics -- a fully democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in some respects, if I may say that so provocative, China is today similar to the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- you remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that's a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism and liberals like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">"he was particularly skeptical, which affects the democratic development."</seg>
<seg id="998">"what can be observed now in China, resembles very the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"now to blame China now, that has done what the West has done in the 19th century, has a tremendous amount of hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">"BG: I'm sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as Minister of Finance, beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I did that it comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from personal view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely to adopt us from self-sufficiency, and the perpetual denial that a massive decline in the euro area ran, and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- on the way, the first proposal was that this denial was revealed --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the euro zone, within the European group, continues to deny the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">"however, you know what comes."</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries an economic system that is not viable to receive life through political will and authoritarianism, it will be able to delay it a while, but when changes occurs, it happens abrupt and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you look ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have any future if we do not change their construction.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everybody who looks back -- seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a Finance Minister, or anyone who gives a minister who claims after 6 months in office, especially in such tense situation, it claims that he has no mistake, then that is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"of course, I made mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the end of February during the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest concern on the sides of the donor to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they merely wanted to bring our government a case, just because they did not want to deal with the verts that ran through the Eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to concede that they have been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">None of the troika creditors imposed on us that policy has imposed us and one: "that was a colossal mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: in spite of all this, and despite the aggressive push of talks, you seem to be quite pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if they have not survived, the free flow forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not be disastrous for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"if we allow ourselves to hit the path of a post-modern 1930, what it appears to me, it will be as well tolerable for the future of Europeans and the non-Europeans."</seg>

<seg id="1038">"from Roy Price, most of them have never heard, although it is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for much of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is Vice-employed at Amazon Studios, "</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has an icon and describes itself on Twitter as" movies, TV, technology, tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">"Roy has a very important job, because he is responsible for the shows and the content to share the Amazon."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can not select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are on the right at this corner."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the site IMDb. the review goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review received.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"will show your show with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" "Breaking bath," "The Wire" -- all the shows that addicted, where, after having looked at a season, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left hand side, here at this end, shows how" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- that's enough to tell you what happens at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve, because I think you have already need special intelligence to submit" Toddlers and Tiaras "." "</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts on average exploiters, the average television -- the shows, which are neither good nor bad, they simply don't delight."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is available and of course it's the first time that Amazon is doing something, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses for a evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can watch everyone for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon turns out in vain things, it is possible to attack correctly?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators look out these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they will be observed at the check of these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team that will accommodate everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you record when you start the show, when you look for, which parts you can skip or look again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">"you collect millions of data to decide on these data, which show them should produce."</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process these and from it results the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom over four republican US senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it doesn't seem that many of them can remember this show because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve 7,4 amounts and Alpha House landed at 7,5 -- i.e. something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"at the same time with another company, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the Manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it something different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of organising a competition, he and his team looked at the available data via the Netflix viewer, so the reviews they give the shows, their course, what shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use these data to find out these little details about the viewer: what shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all these parts together, they went a Wagtry and decided not to make a Sitcom over four senators but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has landed in such a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards, receives a 9.1 rating on this corner. so exactly where they wanted to go."</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, is the question: what has happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competitive, data sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"you connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"when you collect millions of data for a decision you meet, you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistic as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You can be optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the mines, what you can expect is good TV, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis is not working so this is a little frightening because we live in a time, in which we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does someone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"nobody. OK, this is even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room will ever touch in touch with this software. come in touch, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison here in the USA and ask for discharge, it is likely that data analysis is used in this company to determine whether a dismissal is made or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate television, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence for this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always generated the best results. this is not because a company such as multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of sealed companies are sometimes wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that they can predict by data analysis bursts of flu, of vicious way -- through data analysis of the Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully well and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked properly, year round year, until it suddenly no longer worked,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"in spite of all these errors influencing data in decisions of life - at the workplace, in the legal framework, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">"so, we should rather ensure that data is helpful."</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-based genetics -- an area where some very smart people unimaginable to use many data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be distributed.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you need to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"as a first, you disintegrate this problem into its parts, so you can analyze the items; as a wide-wide you put the items back together to hold a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help create a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to put together the parts back and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">"for this, there is another tool and we all possess it: our brain."</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something that the brain is good, it is parts and pieces together again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to then get a good idea -- especially when it is a brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I believe that Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, why otherwise they wouldn't have been able to get together again and make a show like" House of Cards, "which did not stand in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for that show which meant they went a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first as they selected for TV ideas, then when they chose" Alpha House "as show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision, because they could always say:" "they tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are only one tool and to not forget that, this device is rather useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" Magic 8 Ball. "it is amazing. for decisions using a Jaazor no question you only need to shake the ball to get an answer." most likely, "- right here at this moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will return it later with a technician.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I have made some decisions in my life so far as I should have listened to the ball."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you of course know if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by something much compensation, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"perhaps the ball is wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging message that it still pays off to make decisions, an expert in which you do, and to respond to risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
