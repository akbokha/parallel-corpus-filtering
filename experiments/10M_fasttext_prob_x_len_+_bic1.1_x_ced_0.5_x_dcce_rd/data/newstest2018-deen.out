&quot; Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps , which will change your view of the city &quot;
a Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt where young people are to meet today .
&quot; a greetings , where now is excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel . &quot;
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the peasant reason for farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it &apos;s nervous when landing cards are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
&quot; that knows everybody who had to imagine , because the auto @-@ Nav@@ i took place a green meadow instead of a circum@@ navigation way . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but current - but therefore very enligh@@ tening . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
&quot; then , it is clear how cities and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of Munich Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a Flick@@ werk , which one does not recognise as such . &quot;
&quot; in the great reference card , for towns and villages were more detailed cards , so @-@ called urine datas@@ he@@ ets . &quot;
these were created according to the Bav@@ arian surve@@ ying administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and jump to the first understanding of Bavaria .
your principal : Napoleon .
the French He@@ er@@ es@@ führer occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ war with Austria .
&quot; Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic recording of Bay@@ erns , on behalf of course to military purposes . &quot;
even if French troops went to the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 : they were the present neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map .
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph was driving the project ahead , founded the &quot; top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ measurable Bureau . &quot;
the certificate of urine for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is to be found like all others on the Bay@@ erische Staats@@ bibliothek .
the comparison morning / Today is the state of state capital the most impressive .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling that appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
&quot; Send@@ ling was formed 21 years after the map , thus 1877 , as a Munich city district . &quot;
&quot; today , the shelter in the middle of the city is located in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings concentrate around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was first named 1878 after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the rebellion of the Bav@@ arian peasants against Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : in addition , a small @-@ shaped map appears with dozens of lines and numbers : hand @-@ written flo@@ wer@@ pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Ur@@ eup &quot; &quot; from which the basic tax was derived . &quot;
small plots show there today no farmers more - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green space is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 Schau@@ platz , was in the 19th century in fact a meadow - and no concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the field of urine , one reads in the area of today &apos;s district A@@ u @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not only the road names &quot; &quot; on Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; &quot; or from the ascent &quot; &quot; On the air &quot; &quot; but also in large letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ strasse lock you can once find people with madness . &quot;
there was 18@@ 58 / 59 found the Mün@@ chner circle @-@ ir@@ ren@@ berg &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ nen . &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard from Gu@@ dden was directed at the institution - the psychiat@@ r@@ ists who brought to King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended for example the chains of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren .
&quot; in addition , he is forbidden to apply to the personnel to apply violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has employed for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients had been ranked first , later on 500 places were enlarged . &quot;
at some point this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the cycles in hair of 1905 .
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ East , is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ric Germany . &quot;
now the area of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt are now meeting young people in Munich &apos;s Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and shifted it to a youth @-@ home with an apprenticeship .
&quot; west is the football ground of the TS@@ V München East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 we set up the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; &quot; - in architec@@ turally based on the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ ator , who had been destroyed during World War II at bomb attack . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed around 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; main square &quot; , &quot; the Bu@@ ing@@ erst@@ raße was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought to the Second World War even in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Al@@ lies were in the middle of December 1944 many holes in the city centre .
a great stayed until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
&quot; the English institute , small business buildings and a greetings from the Middle Ages was once at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days work and take place on 5 April 2017 . &quot;
&quot; with the sli@@ der , the old Munich map can be compared with the air picture of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof . &quot;
civil rights group published travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the promotion of coloured has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i because of the discrimin@@ atory policy and the rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel advisory for the federal state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to come into force up to 28 August 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i , as a number of frag@@ mentary , ra@@ ving incidents in recent times throughout the state and here are noted , &quot; says it in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recent law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder to win discrimination , as well as the prosecution bodies of the state , the dis@@ proportionate to minorities , prompted the group to release the travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
&quot; they have bre@@ aches of citizens &apos; rights , men happen . &quot;
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are assembled or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such an incidence that we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States .
&quot; the group quoted incidents like racial decay against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died in fragile circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during the journey and taken by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i , without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recent post @-@ owned report of the Office of the Governor General of Mis@@ sour@@ i , in which it is shown that black drivers in the state will be more common in the state 75 per cent more frequently than white . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said chapel . &quot;
people must be willing to bring che@@ ating money or to know the relatives that they travel through the state .
Mis@@ sour@@ i signed in 2015 100 of hate crime according to the latest figures from hate @-@ break reporting program of the F@@ BI that put the state in relation to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i Law that would make it harder to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; previously , the American Civil liberties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) have issued travel arrangements for Texas and Arizona , after the states of immigration legislation , the local law enforcement authorities did not commit to per@@ secu@@ te people because of immigration violations , which are contributing to the AC@@ L@@ U to further escal@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; travel atten@@ tions are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but in recent times stakeholders have used the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
setting @-@ down project is elementary
the fisher@@ man &apos;s Wei@@ de@@ vil@@ s project is a success project and continues to continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Bundestag Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have given a picture on the spot .
&quot; at the right @-@ grab@@ en@@ hof of the Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fis@@ her@@ bacher CD@@ U village met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members . &quot;
&quot; Markus Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann gave first insights into his business , in which it covers 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and also many young animals supplied and housed in five apartments . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; black milk &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative mark@@ eter for the milk of his cows , so Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este comes only region@@ ality .
&quot; because he is also called BL@@ H@@ V @-@ Chairman of Fis@@ her@@ os , he described the m@@ ist project as &quot; &quot; fundamental &quot; . &quot; &quot;
I can act on such a steep surfaces not profitable .
&quot; the green space @-@ surface for a lot of work , much needed to be processed with the engine sense . &quot;
&quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann stressed . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 he took over the eleventh operation and generated this without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zers , even if he is not a bio@@ business . &quot;
for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; the Commune has recognized the importance of the consecr@@ ator project and is happy about the leaders promotion . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hect@@ are , farmers must be supported . &quot;
&quot; it is possible , that the for@@ estation of the surface could be drawn up for quite a while . &quot;
&quot; the greatest treasure we have , are the people working in agriculture and do thoughts about how to continue their operation , &quot; said the mayor . &quot;
farmers are often in criticism because of the funding
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure area is therefore 40 hectares , which are not allowed until at least 20@@ 23 . &quot;
&quot; from the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of the leader was promoted , a quarter contributed to the Municipality of Fis@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers left 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of Wei@@ de@@ fence . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the longevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and land women . &quot;
&quot; also for Peter White was fixed : &quot; &quot; here the best food is produced . &quot;
the Agricultural Policy ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state support of Wei@@ de@@ fence .
the destination is the disclosure of the Black Sea .
the condition is the presence of one of the L@@ PR @-@ drawn conveyor cr@@ acks .
&quot; in addition , the strong area may not be tricky ( H@@ ang@@ le@@ ction over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the for@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the fisher@@ man &apos;s wheat @-@ down project , 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build nearly 16 kilometers of fence . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares , the lower costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump will take the Statue of Liberty
the safest sign of a regime shift is to push when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the careful overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos place in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew certainly what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heat dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N on the proposals of the President to the dras@@ tic limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to be fair , Miller attacked not the statue themselves . &quot;
a hor@@ de of Bo@@ at@@ land@@ owners and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ers would have made him gel@@ yn@@ cht if he had done it .
&quot; but he attacked their significance , and in particular the meaning that you were attributed to , when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after completion of the monument , has been added . &quot;
&quot; when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ained as Miller A@@ co@@ sta : &quot; I do not want to enter into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot;
the poem which you refer to is later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller lies properly properly , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about contemporary resonance to the suspen@@ sive words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; &quot; your tired , your poor , / your sup@@ pressed masses who desire to breathe free , / the miserable trash of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; there was never a time in which the &quot; &quot; saving waste &quot; &quot; was better to see on our monitors . &quot;
Miller was not committed to literary critic - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ umps .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict with the importance of America .
Lazarus - and their friends who settled to place their words after their death on the base - knew very well that they have accomplished a high @-@ political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Re@@ public@@ anism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of Ex@@ il@@ ants .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just like Lazarus changed the importance of the statue , the people of the right wing wanted to change this long before . &quot;
&quot; the big scre@@ am of Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for coming from Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty should not invite , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative thing that bring the American flame into the converted world : &quot; Lady Liberty is proceeding . &quot;
she is supposed to carry the F@@ ack@@ et of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch is not supposed to enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something .
the meaning of the statue is quite and at all a question of the point of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus consisted of them to see them as they came from the exhaus@@ tible , but hope@@ ful people after long and often terrible trips on the decks of ships was seen . &quot;
&quot; it is in the tru@@ est sense about seeing the world from the perspective of people , seek refuge and improve a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome you have to hear .
and of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever wish to recognise .
&quot; their tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way but the hatred , who is their only source of power , ign@@ ite . &quot;
world Championships 2017 : Neil Black lo@@ ops Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle reminds themselves of a time when only two vill@@ i belonged to the team of the UK .
&quot; the performance director of the Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member states in the World Cup tournament will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; a record of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday . &quot;
&quot; black believes that &quot; in Scotland &quot; &quot; something special &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find it &quot; , &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is it &apos;s absolutely brilliant .
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals of medals , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - which can be started against Sir Mo Far@@ ah at the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle was elected by the team for team@@ rider . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ dh is rather modest . &quot;
&quot; her captain speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling that em@@ ili@@ dh was totally natural , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Commonwealth of silver med@@ all@@ ists who will compete in their fifth world Championships at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; &quot; incredible &quot; &quot; that 16 bucks in the British team are . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes from the world championship was seven that have been reached in 1983 and 2015 .
&quot; on this path , Mu@@ ir runs on this path and last year , five British and two European records set up last year . &quot;
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runners . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another sc@@ arf that was seen after a great season , which included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle remembered her first World Championships as the only other Sch@@ otte was in the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
&quot; the Mann@@ es@@ ian capitals says that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; &quot; to the fact that many of their country@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases also with the medals and the Fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing to be part of the team captain , is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so it was a great honour , but to know that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chosen to make it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the treasures that belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we came .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise to po@@ di@@ gs . &quot;
what my speech as a captain concerns ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
&quot; it is therefore really important to put on this home support and benefit from it , that we are back at the Olympiastadion . &quot;
&quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete , and there will be just such a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
blocking of critic@@ isms about Facebook : don &apos;t take you to a public office if you cannot tolerate the inser@@ tion of voters
the father of our country knew something from bad press .
&quot; the Americans we loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers proposed it because of all , from home politics to its political principles . &quot;
&quot; he sli@@ pped at the criticism , certainly . &quot;
but he did not have his critics to silence .
&quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; the freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we will be led as sheep to slaughter . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Governor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ w@@ gans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on the official Facebook page .
and the American Civil liberties are ens@@ ored him therefore at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the St@@ ab of the Governor sent the law@@ suit as a free@@ v@@ ol , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a guy like Ho@@ gan .
this is a Republi@@ que Governor in a overwhel@@ m@@ ingly democratic state that is amazing .
it has the two @-@ highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with principles .
he was also very skill@@ fully to use Facebook as the primary agent to connect with their voters and to debate his ha@@ ired head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the block@@ age of persons appearing on the side of the governor - which is a public forum that is officially designated as officially and by employees working with public tax currency - unnecessary , and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post defended Ho@@ go@@ an@@ in Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the actions of the governor , and argued that the block@@ age of comments is nothing more than a moderation . &quot;
&quot; but it is too easy to use the image of fl@@ amm@@ ing or sp@@ amm@@ ing people , which vibr@@ ate the whi@@ p on line . &quot;
the post talked to some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
&quot; these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a pastor , no tro@@ lls . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments are respectful , thou@@ ght@@ fully and not profound . &quot;
the pastor cruci@@ fied the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic Faith .
&quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ water filled , but she asked about hate crime . &quot;
&quot; I commented on the fact that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate , and other current news , &quot; wrote them in the commentary box of the message &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea when a number of people became a position on the same topic , then they are mis@@ understood by some rather than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected people . &quot;
&quot; what the staff of the Govern@@ ors marked as &quot; &quot; concentrated Spam attack &quot; , &quot; others would probably call &quot; &quot; mind@@ set &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to watch a message by simply blocked a critic or a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in previous time when you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical notes , to burn or burn demonstrators , and to silence them . &quot;
but that is exactly what is happening in digital .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critici@@ ze that he has critic@@ ised Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is compl@@ ained by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell in Virg@@ ina .
&quot; the chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County last the first A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. district James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she nominated a vot@@ er by her Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U due to its use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
this should not be so heavy .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of an affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lies between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous brie@@ f@@ ers suggested for his leadership . &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous tro@@ lls .
&quot; the people , the pseu@@ don@@ y@@ me like &quot; &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ iz@@ arius &quot; , &quot; wrote all the letters of newspapers that Washington &apos;s decisions made . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions , which critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , over@@ led his ministry , according to historical documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not have her silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an refin@@ ty hopes for home comfort at Renaissance Club
&quot; the former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days on home comfort , since the Renaissance Club was hosted at East Lorraine to the 25th issue of Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , which led next to the end of the Ar@@ cher@@ field left until final findings , before he was opposed to Paul E@@ ales , has been linked to the new eye @-@ site and acts as a tournament message on behalf of the club of the club and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his glory with this event . &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from his best , he is in a great condition . &quot;
Jerry made a great job when he set up this place .
he is a eager pro@@ pon@@ ent of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the British E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he won in his 32 @-@ year career at both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; this really feels particularly true , &quot; said the player in South@@ port ranks players . &quot;
&quot; I have not able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open , since it was in the year after I won it out of the program . &quot;
return to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always be appreciated .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year to the European Senior Tour , returns to the promotion on home ground . &quot;
this event will be his first Scottish show since Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want it well , but you also feel that additional print . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
glad I am happy as it did .
&quot; with the trio at the field the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Champion Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ V . &quot;
&quot; Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six ch@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ All@@ ister , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ros@@ s Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; the entrance is free , the parking lot costs £ 5 a car with a living room and £ 10 per car with two or more in@@ mates . &quot;
all proceeds from the Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by passive smoking
in the past two decades less people died of lung cancer in the past two decades .
&quot; at this result , scientists of the University Hospital of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) are present in a study . &quot;
&quot; according to our estimates a year 16@@ 7 lung cancer is due to liabilities on passive smoking , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , he was able to approach his own study on this subject of 1994 . &quot;
at that time there were still 400 lung cancer cases because of pas@@ si@@ ro@@ b per year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house@@ holders prove to be very complex
&quot; construction work in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; lie somewhat in the time , &quot; says the head of the building Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the house closures , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as in the underground is much more ver@@ ted , which is not noted in the plans . &quot;
&quot; the traffic , which always hin@@ ders the construction work , represents a big problem for the construction tr@@ up@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of the motor@@ ists against red amp@@ les and Ab@@ lock is already huge , &quot; &quot; explains Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is locked and just the line buses are justified for transit .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been busy with the work on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; the hot days were already very nice , too . &quot;
&quot; but luckily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with bold mineral water , &quot; Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian Gold@@ land
&quot; when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i bo@@ ve the dinner , they use no stove . &quot;
they even rarely use a pot .
&quot; in her wood house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the shortened tu@@ ber will be extracted and swal@@ lowed up . &quot;
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the arm@@ chair - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bu@@ cket in a roof@@ ed room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , you have not been assigned to their fields . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , late at work can be dangerous : most of the village men are unemployed , and many are drinking hard , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody knew it , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village around &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life of the high@@ land of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was conceived in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders to vote against the occupation forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement that stir@@ red up for independence against the Dutch rule , turned rapidly against the government of Jak@@ arta , who runs control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or law . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua @-@ Neu@@ gu@@ ine@@ as the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is . the trip includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .
there are no public transport .
&quot; the city with approximately 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses that are surrounded by bam@@ boo fence , and from cor@@ ru@@ gated roofs , converted by r@@ ust into different yellow @-@ brown notes . &quot;
&quot; very few in@@ don@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , for journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
before Christian missionaries arrived , hon@@ ouring Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans a God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , and points to their lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , their dark shirt and their bright rock . &quot;
&quot; earlier we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is the poorest province where 28 % of the people live under the poverty line and some of the worst child@@ birth and alphabe@@ tis@@ ation rates in Asia have .
but it is also In@@ don@@ ia Gold@@ land .
&quot; the biggest and profitable gol@@ mine of the world , grass@@ lands , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high @-@ country provincial in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has built in the value of 3.@@ 1 billion US dollars and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has a value of estimated 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; this wealth , however , are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua that ensure that In@@ don@@ esi@@ ens has preserved a profound presence . &quot;
&quot; an examination from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port local dairy farmers and units between 1998 and 2004 paid almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ lian demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden G@@ ans and become mer@@ c@@ il@@ ess .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ tured since 1969 by the Indones@@ ian military . &quot;
Mass@@ ent@@ ang@@ ers in Pap@@ u@@ as stem land in the 1970 @-@ 1970 have been placed in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Committee on genocide .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indones@@ ian police included more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstrators in the region alone . &quot;
&quot; we Wer@@ der All Ver@@ sions &quot; means it in a report of the Arch@@ diocese Bris@@ bane dating from 2016 , in which reports on atrocities of the previous year are included , such as un@@ lawful exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electro@@ stops are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims because each week occurred , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researchers for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; the screws are reinforced , since Pap@@ u@@ as resources have a influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but the demographic development is changing , since Muslim econom@@ ists come from the popul@@ ous islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ung @-@ Kant@@ ines sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut . &quot;
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants began to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ local , who moved to the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
it has the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama &apos;s M@@ um &#91; the Women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - will cost their market .
&quot; the Indones@@ ian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the Volk@@ sm@@ al and as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to tackle the inequalities and legal injuries in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; the former carp@@ enter , 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel betrayed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low @-@ point two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is initiation in October . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indones@@ ian soldiers jour@@ ne@@ yed on a motorcycle through the darkness . &quot;
the frightened children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took a impetus on her tone , and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who drank , said , and smote the group with their gun , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired up into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard sm@@ elled that he fell into coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building was set to the nearby government commission and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; approximately 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves on a football field before the local police station and the military service center to demand justice . &quot;
they bore cerem@@ onial Jag@@ db@@ ö@@ gen and conducted the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - in the circle continuously and a bir@@ thing im@@ it@@ ated - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some prot@@ esters began to drag stones at police and military post .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal spark : &quot; when the masses are over three times resistance , they shoot them dead , &quot; &quot; says it in an official document of TIM@@ E that has not been released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ emi@@ as Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ wning danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned , I suddenly shot in my lin@@ kes hand wr@@ ist , &quot; &quot; he said TIM@@ E on the porch of his colourful wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still does not know who folded , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered together . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired &quot; , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and studied his body to be sure he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who carries out how many in@@ don@@ esi@@ ans only one name , the TIM@@ E in dark mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I have kis@@ sed it .
&quot; the editor @-@ spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua @-@ police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said re@@ porters , that his officers want their station only &quot; secure &quot; because they will be attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstrators were killed and many more injured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings arrived only the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks was Jok@@ ow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura a passionate talk , in which he vo@@ iced sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and s@@ wor@@ e the historical abnorm@@ alities of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I would like that this case will be solved immediately so that there will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , in October 2016 , he concluded an extra@@ judicial mechanism for sett@@ ling historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injury have occurred long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and early 2000 @-@ six@@ ties .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that must go through . &quot;
&quot; then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he said on June 5 in Jak@@ arta with TIM@@ E and said , he has no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; the vor@@ anto that has been indicted for crimes against humanity because of the &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua was already attached , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such allegations with gri@@ pping un@@ belief .
&quot; I was interviewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear for years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , have fear to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus reiter@@ ated that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
&quot; he says that he was defeated by the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims . &quot;
&quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought after me , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
the sh@@ acks have not stopped .
on Tuesday closed the Indones@@ ian police on villagers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between the villagers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , he died a person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dro@@ wned when he fis@@ her in a nearby river died on the way to hospital . &quot;
Ascen@@ ded villagers prot@@ ested before the site office of the company .
&quot; the police said that the villagers threw stones at officers , who re@@ acted upon it , when they were fired . &quot;
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot a lot and a killer .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital , and witness how the injured is quickly delivered here . &quot;
&quot; I have hidden my house two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called to account the officers involved and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police in the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an un@@ ru@@ gated board for the Indones@@ ian government .
&quot; the lack of sensory development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribal Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the Reb@@ els Army , who claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by attacking spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indones@@ ian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM guides come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ k@@ Ko@@ go@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in the last few years , under the pretext of &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never emerge again .
&quot; among the people of Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens the dissatisfaction .
&quot; the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is for locals too expensive . &quot;
bread is just as easy reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
&quot; agriculture is the task of women , who can handle four or five fields of sweet potato . &quot;
keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest on the local market is sold .
ten pieces of Not@@ a precious only 10,000 in@@ dones@@ ian R@@ up@@ ies ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
&quot; over time , economic inequalities between the indigenous Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown up since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire . &quot;
&quot; the few jobs that exist in the region , usually go to the better educated and aff@@ lu@@ ent migrants . &quot;
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to competitive their own companies .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Chief of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions of reporting international media remain tense . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ the and Basi@@ lle Long@@ cham@@ p were de@@ ported due to lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to the movies . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Vice @-@ Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaigns to raise the limitations of the coverage in order to promote transparency and development . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from in@@ don@@ esi@@ on un@@ tranquil provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua to report : visa exp@@ atri@@ ation and a black list , &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
the lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbors of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March six Pacific States - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Sal@@ om@@ ones Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically considered the O@@ PM .
&quot; the speaker of the Indones@@ ian Foreign Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia still holds a democratic system , and there is free media , so it is difficult to dis@@ miss the evidence of human rights accidents . &quot;
people on site want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , conducted under the direction of the human right @-@ ambassador Ke@@ es Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , the locals removed their silence and urged him &quot; &quot; We want liberty , &quot; according to a source who also participated in the meeting , but remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; in Indonesia , a further presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua say they are probably not going to vote again for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ uts , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council . &quot;
&quot; he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , in impover@@ ished educ@@ ators and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , have to consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; that he has to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they do not need money , they only want justice , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and intimi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sha@@ dows had a last symbolic act of the rut : the body of a victim was buried on a site right opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they might never give justice to them , but at least they will not forget those responsible for crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with su@@ ble@@ t head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos;@@ skyscrapers of Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai in the book and forced hundreds of inhabitants , from which 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ storey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that is swe@@ pt through the high house in just two years , which is called random the Tor@@ ch @-@ Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we went through fire @-@ alert and scre@@ ams of the people .
&quot; we ran the stairs down , and it took about 10 minutes to get from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; told a residents who gave his name as George , Re@@ uters . &quot;
&quot; Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 local time ( 00@@ .00 hrs ) , the fire extingu@@ ishes and the building cool@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the government said , they work on providing accommodation for those involved . &quot;
&quot; the incident can be used to revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials , which are used in outdoor areas of skyscrapers around the world . &quot;
&quot; an examination by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after whose brand in 2015 yiel@@ ded that the majority of the damage caused by the clothes , the exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation , came . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police , they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding in the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of an Bran@@ ch@@ ment in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International tennis association ( IT@@ F ) is completed with his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the AG@@ M .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single is only supported on two winners , Hau@@ ch@@ thin , not supported by the required two @-@ third majority . &quot;
&quot; the fact , often very long , but even therefore very cher@@ ished five @-@ sentence classics remain the traditional and thus preserved . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of member countries voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ g@@ ty was therefore only scarce . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our membership nations do not have accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; Hag@@ ger@@ ty said . &quot;
we will continue to work on improving the quality .
&quot; even at the end of the vote , I had already reached the proposal to take the finals at a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : so the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be in the first round of the host , in the first round . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the cost of the Organ@@ izer , the requirements are reli@@ eved in terms of training courses etc . and players will have to complete the Davis Cup at less official media dates before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 of 5 US travelers sets out articles into the plane , finds out a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by passengers revealed that more than 20 per cent deliberately or un@@ consciously deposited objects at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration are ornam@@ ent , including at least 6 percent , who che@@ ating the aircraft while sending accidentally written kni@@ ves or other objects with blade . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 per cent claimed , they would have bel@@ ated that they were be@@ ying with bul@@ lets , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey at more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , performed - also noted that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules . &quot;
&quot; by the respondents , the en@@ cor@@ es that they wis@@ s@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were . &quot;
&quot; the most common objects , which were visi@@ bly by T@@ SA agents , were foods and liquids . &quot;
&quot; more than 3 percent added to , kno@@ w@@ ingly items with blades carried by the security control while 2,@@ 2 percent of the female respondents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respondents also confirm that they were inten@@ tionally commerci@@ alized drugs in the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; the company said , I have asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many accidentally smug@@ gling are brought by the airport security and how many things were inten@@ tionally done . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that people , the most likely smug@@ gling , kno@@ w@@ ingly or un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly - due to the safety of those who were most often flying . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing . &quot;
people are often uncertain what liquids they are allowed to take or how much of it .
&quot; so there is no surprise that the largest quantity of liquids conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA conf@@ is@@ cated objects . &quot;
&quot; a time long thought , the guys that T@@ SA could view books as smug@@ glers . &quot;
&quot; liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k it does not matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la @-@ customers cancel order
elec@@ tro @-@ 1000@@ end@@ s@@ assa El@@ on Mus@@ k gives you the huge number of pre @-@ orders for its new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he has underestimated the fact that a part of the customer has withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the continually triumph@@ ant figures , Tes@@ la conductor El@@ on Mus@@ k aim at the announcement of the recent quarterly assessment for the first time a different , less gl@@ oss number : the cancellation of the new mass @-@ model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in the past few months , Mus@@ k applied frequently with the more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery just starts . &quot;
&quot; now spati@@ t Mus@@ k one : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 63@@ ,000 have been withdrawn again . &quot;
critics had always pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; during a cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euros ( in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment &quot; completely back . &quot;
&quot; currently , 45@@ ,000 of such in@@ binding reservations are charged prior to , spatial mus@@ k at a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , that the cancellation of so far could be about twelve percent of all orders to the problem , the Tes@@ la chef does not believe . &quot;
&quot; its argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not on demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la amounted to 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; 2018 it is supposed to be - all models assembled - 500,000 , 2020 one million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , a day of 1800 reservations are available . &quot;
&quot; whoever orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; , &quot; must be reck@@ oned in the second half of 2018 with delivery - if Tes@@ la creates to drive its brand new , never before in practice tested production lines without greater inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum utilisation . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but it comes to larger delays , then the uni@@ formity of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; because then , the company can not prevent the satisfied customers to run away in Sch@@ ars . &quot;
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt moves back to reducing emissions from the rules of the Obama Era to reduce emissions
&quot; a day after he was compl@@ ained of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the leader of the Environmental Protection Agency , had to delay his earlier decision to implement the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ caused air pollution . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes as its agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities towards response faster than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit which had been raised against his previous position in a federal trial court .
&quot; it is a deadline , which ran off on 1 October for States to meet the standards of 2015 for bot@@ her@@ ing o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he will delay the compliance with a year to study the plan , and to avoid them , to im@@ pe@@ de in local decisions or to im@@ pe@@ de economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was in front of his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump pro@@ secutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time to take into account environmental protection rules for a long time . &quot;
&quot; since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt repeated repe@@ ats to block or delay the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden conversion of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ cut regular @-@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Constitutional Court has decided that the EPA administrator has crossed its authority as he tried to vali@@ date the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , oil and gas companies for monitoring and reduction of methane . &quot;
&quot; in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ dence proposed that its full @-@ face at o@@ zone standards simply struck the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often kept the deadlines for carrying out and then awaiting the appointment of being defined by activ@@ ist@@ groups and others , and said in an agreement to set the date for the carrying out , &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt said the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by court procedures , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot;
we also accept the law and authority that there are us .
&quot; nevertheless , the EPA statement said that P@@ ru@@ itt at some point will take advantage of its &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legal data available , &quot; to ensure that the rules &quot; on a solid policy and the best available information is based . &quot;
the Re@@ public@@ ans in Congress push for a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
one in last month &apos;s draft law is intended to delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet made to vote in the Senate .
&quot; the New York General Public Affairs At@@ tor@@ ney Eric C@@ der@@ man , who compl@@ ained the Coalition of the States who compl@@ ained the EPA in this week , said the group intended to maintain the legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the revers@@ al of EPA - according to our law@@ suits - is an important asset for the health and safety of these 6,@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly flowing into their communities , &quot; says Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot;

&quot; it is worrying about how much pressure it needs to get this reasonable step by the responsible person responsible for the protection of the air that we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot;

tum@@ ours celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche is invited to the old cemetery A@@ real in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16 July , at 16.@@ 30 p.m. to a Seren@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ arius , a popular place to stay . &quot;
the visitors of the sixth benefit seren@@ ade can be enchanted by this powerful place .
saving and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors for their intentions .
&quot; Walter Mart@@ ini stressed : &quot; &quot; it is a unique small small town . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Wur@@ ttem@@ berg Ur@@ sel : count Hermann of Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the l@@ ister Eber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and his brother Diet@@ rich for 20 Mark silver .
&quot; according to the certificate of the certificate of the certificate , on the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the con@@ sti@@ ff parish church was also a magnificent courtyard , to which the church or the pat@@ ron@@ age belonged to it and not the other way round . &quot;
so there were people there .
&quot; as seen from the description of the Freu@@ dian Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today still appears in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the rich settlement of the village . &quot;
old cards from the time around the year 1600 under@@ pin these historical conditions .
the Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ right was created from the early Middle Ages .
&quot; a Lord who built a church built , and occupied with a pastor , remained the owner of this church and was able to inher@@ it this own church . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the right to use a pastor or to propose a new pastor . &quot;
three alt@@ ars were there in the church and two bells on the tower .
the biggest of the two sh@@ attered on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell was then first mentioned in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later during World War II in 1942 . &quot;
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows have been introduced and the bel@@ lows are stolen .
the roof was in@@ tight .
17@@ 96 lag@@ ged French troops in the vicinity of the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the Church dro@@ wned 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ ber Hil@@ arius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from hear@@ ers . &quot;
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was abandoned .
only the cherry storm allowed one stand .
in the New Year @-@ eight 18@@ 34 a storm made a storm and half collap@@ sed .
&quot; to prevent evil , the tower was abandoned . &quot;
only the existing tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g still remained as a witness of the 750 year old church history .
today Horst K@@ all@@ en@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em maintained by the &quot; creative Rent@@ als &quot; as successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn the Hil@@ arius facility .
&quot; as organis@@ er , friends and sponsors are loaded on Sunday , 16 July , the sixth of the Seren@@ ade on the old cemetery for St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
this is designed by the Com@@ bo des Ke@@ pler @-@ G@@ ymnasi@@ ums Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with ess@@ ays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Glacier .
local Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 16.@@ 30 .
the admission is from 15 : 30 PM .
on the sounded of the Seren@@ ade is taking place a trunk in front of the cemetery .
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to forest , &quot; the organis@@ ers place the fantastic view . &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
&quot; the organis@@ ers hope for many supporters of the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility , which is of importance for turmoil and audi@@ tors . &quot;
the friends and sponsors of the tum@@ ours feel particularly oblig@@ ated to the home @-@ care as seren@@ ade organizer Walter Mart@@ ini .
society wants to review approval of Win@@ dr@@ yers
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ ave itself &quot; &quot; does not see a legal basis for the construction , and therefore has turned towards the Council . &quot;
&quot; the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ ep &quot; &quot; has been asked to increase its approval for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval was approved on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , since at the time in Vier@@ sen , only at the border to swal@@ low a wind power station exists . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration area , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , at the same time the concentration zone also causes power consumption for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones should prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had a few days previously decided by a change in the area of wind farm , a second wind turbine zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but which had not been approved the District Government Düsseldorf , because of a form@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planned legal requirement , the author@@ ising per@@ secutor is still un@@ lawful and therefore also increase , &quot; said Christoph Ar@@ k , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
current status of things : the city council entered again the Wind@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette before the summer break ; a permit of the District government is still pending .
&quot; hint : &quot; &quot; in this place the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines are legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; the corresponding letter has been received by the Circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; stated a speaker . &quot;
the circle takes them on the occasion to check the matter again .
but it is expected not to be hal@@ ted that the procedure is stopped .
&quot; with a view of ongoing proceedings at the Board of Justice , the Circle on Thursday wanted not to take in content on the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NE@@ W Re , a subsidiary of the NE@@ W , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette the construction of four per 200 meters high wind@@ mills . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , the company , where the city of Vier@@ sen , had been involved , ei@@ ghty agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares wide open @-@ minded . &quot;
&quot; with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be covered - this represents around one fifth of the electricity requirements of all four quad@@ rant households . &quot;
the NE@@ W Re intends to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , four @-@ four coun@@ cill@@ ors made green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor cras@@ hes together : Frau dies in a terrible accident
a terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday afternoon at 10 am on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn circle ) .
a woman was violated .
two other persons were easily injured .
the state road remained locked over hours .
&quot; after police summ@@ aries , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch came with their car in the frame of the accompanying car with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion to L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel . &quot;
city and retailers plan &quot; Home shopping &quot; -@@ weekend
bathroom Langen@@ osp@@ za@@ ers and people from the region are to discover the shopping spots in the city in September .
&quot; the profession , and the municipal authorities want to use the weekend on 8th and 9th September to enti@@ ce the inhabitants to the city &apos;s shopping stroll . &quot;
&quot; as the chairman of the profession , Christian King , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend will raise the customers for this and which offers its own city from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their courses . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are to invite you to the &quot; &quot; M@@ It@@ ter@@ night shopping . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the action is not only in the inhabitants of the city and the closer region . &quot;
&quot; in preparation for commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bag that point out the Ak@@ tions weekend , Christian King . &quot;
municipal authorities and commercial are working together with the Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Commerce .
&quot; to ensure the commercial ren@@ ditions and the city go into another stage of the &quot; &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown &quot; &quot; project . &quot;
&quot; these include new offers , like the first &quot; &quot; active day &quot; &quot; to well @-@ selling Sunday , talks with all the tra@@ ilers and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the quote on parking fees that day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potential should be re @-@ opened again or again . &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city center when shopping out of sight .
&quot; at the end , all of them would have to facilitate the inner city - up to landlords , the companies of the whole city and one . &quot;
&quot; it worked , with a network to overcome the le@@ th@@ arg@@ y which was partly spread , had said King in spring . &quot;
&quot; Bir@@ git Stre@@ ich , director of the I@@ HK Centers in Müh@@ l@@ hausen divided , that in the nationwide third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day , five Th@@ ür@@ inger cities are taking part . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za this is Wei@@ mar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and St@@ ay . &quot;
&quot; the day sol@@ le &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and make its significance for the community of our cities stronger , &quot; &quot; I mean . &quot;
the action taking part of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners makes it clear that every citizen can affect its direct environment itself .
two dead and several injured after explosion at US school

Tr@@ ump continued after sc@@ anned tran@@ scription of telep@@ hon@@ y Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and guides of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tr@@ ump asked for a phone at the Mexican President Enri@@ que Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to to say publicly that he would not pay for a planned boundary wall . &quot;
&quot; the US President sent him because he had publicly denoun@@ ced the wall . report@@ edly , he said to him , &quot; &quot; That you may not tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and sw@@ am , Mexico for the project to be paid . &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first attempt with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a tense exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the USA refugees who emigr@@ ated to Australia , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was introduced by the Obama government to let him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban to the settlement of refugees in the USA . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call , after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford @-@ mass@@ acres : activists lead rac@@ ist mo@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury was driven by a group of spectators in rural mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and shr@@ ink the Ford bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white rider was able to reach the bridge , a group of white men joined forces to block its way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ b - a man middle age in a needle ro@@ aming - took a long train at its ci@@ gar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
&quot; inside , the occup@@ ants put in fear . &quot;
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; bro@@ ker the man . &quot;
&quot; h@@ ol him from the car ! &quot;
excav@@ ated the silence was torn as a young black man from the passenger seat .
&quot; luckily this terrible scene was played on 22 July , just a post @-@ position . &quot;
&quot; but if then a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience is very real si@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , civil rights to the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge are coming back to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 were worthwhile . &quot;
no one has ever been charged with murder .
&quot; it is really unfortunate that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we know them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; said T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks , who helps in the organisation of post . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt road on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ year former congress of the State Georgia and a lifetime of civil rights .
&quot; for him , his position serves as a dram@@ atic call to action and represents an annual memory of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that injustice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want criminal proceedings , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot;
a doctor of medical professionals puts a towel over the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI files , received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men were suspected of Mon@@ ro@@ e and the neighbouring Grap@@ hic in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but no one has ever been charged .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on an open foot for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch campaigns were always known all over the city : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision taken by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the first time to vote their voice in the summer for the first time in the summer . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to the F@@ BI of the black colo@@ mp@@ tom@@ bs Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - supposedly because of a woman . &quot;
&quot; Broo@@ ks said , the rum@@ our in the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she carried , did not hide from her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to liber@@ ate Mal@@ com from prison , so F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
&quot; but when she went away from prison and went to the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b re@@ arranged the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison that has prepared and arranged the Mor@@ de and includes a F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also evident that there was a com@@ poster between the state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the mur@@ ders , evidence , and the identity of witnesses dec@@ eived . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is formulated it even more striking .
&quot; it was a electoral massacre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
&quot; almost a decade ago Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene led the annual retrosp@@ ective of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; her presentation is vivid , gri@@ pping and founded in a kind of deep racism that many believe in America does not exist anymore . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch , and even more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that that is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we then are confronted with his sin@@ fulness in us all &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or hear what I have done . &quot;
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors finished - a dozen White White and the rest of Schwar@@ ze - went into a room and lau@@ ghing as a well @-@ played overview of the piece started . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Green@@ it Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of Chief clan member for years , but he said , the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I am not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story alive , because we would not want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the tro@@ op scre@@ ams , and pus@@ hes him that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , swal@@ lowed by my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona er@@ wi@@ pers the fire .
there is a break .
and then each ( at least all black actor ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laugh at the lau@@ ght .
&quot; what ? ! , asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still ki@@ ck@@ ery . &quot;
I just don &apos;t think that white people back then &apos; n --- he &apos; said .
&quot; but , &quot; funny one of the other black performers . &quot;
&quot; you only need to meet the hard &quot; &quot; R. &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and that is exactly where the energy shifts in space , a sense of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie replaces the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy doing this properly , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed men . &quot;
the scene starts again .
&quot; this time Ras@@ cona the N @-@ Word says , he says it sharp and with im@@ print . &quot;
absolutely nobody laughs .
this repetition does not end non @-@ violent and fast .
&quot; there is cry , kis@@ ses and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman cloth@@ ed with a funeral gar@@ ment , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie holidays sad &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks in every second word .
about a hundred metres behind it is a group of about four dozen spectators and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
&quot; a pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many come down only the road . &quot;
they experienced nearly eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as depres@@ sing moisture when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bst@@ ones of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; up to that point the mur@@ ders have stayed one anec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de , the air feels donated . &quot;
&quot; when the final notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ected the cor@@ pse . &quot;
&quot; kids ho@@ cken at their heads , record the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ mu@@ red a little boy , as if he wants to remember it . &quot;
after a few minutes we would like to thank Gre@@ ene of the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors take the Lyn@@ ch@@ sei@@ l away and wi@@ pe their tears away .
Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit who has played the clan . &quot;
Nick Ras@@ cona ren@@ ders two of his co @-@ players and then breaks into her arms together that the emotional load of the performance will eventually break up with him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ pered one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you did that for a reason . &quot;
later the audience starts with the actors for dinner together .
&quot; at a table , a white pair from Atlanta is excited about the position with a black pair that they had just met . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ ski strug@@ gled to find words which has left the performance .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come to people who look like yourself and do what they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch still continues &quot; , &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; today the only police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks stayed at his table , he is eating and reminded of the civil rights . &quot;
he said he already started to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; the position is inspired in a certain way , as it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is like we learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own story , whoever does not know his own story is do@@ omed to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Arma@@ ged@@ don &quot; vers@@ ed the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ re@@ uth
&quot; also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , the director Frank Cast@@ or@@ f composed on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e staging in front of gigantic , six @-@ story setting . &quot;
&quot; the turn@@ stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ics ) shows either a s@@ hab@@ by street corner of the bri@@ g@@ rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and E@@ la@@ ste &quot; logo from DDR @-@ times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before , par@@ kt is an open Mercedes @-@ classic car , in which the Rhein@@ killer is more pos@@ ing as rock , or alternatively a I@@ sett@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Gest@@ ap@@ ed oil cas@@ ks remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and greed - that moves through its &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; staging . &quot;
&quot; the three R@@ iz@@ ers - sung by Stephanie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ oth@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; kis@@ sed them Sieg@@ fried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , locks in Hollywood Man@@ ier , a glue in the trunk and enter the Kra@@ w@@ allo cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the glorious Ha@@ gen which surrounds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weight .
brutal the scene when he paraly@@ zes victory .
later you have to believe also Gun@@ ther ( Mark Ei@@ che ) .
the audience would like to thank the ensemble with a powerful applause .
&quot; stor@@ ks are celebrated Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who are hum@@ bled himself modest and the hands for Merkel @-@ smokers . &quot;
&quot; big applause is available for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat back in qui@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; with tension , the performance of Frank Cast@@ or@@ f and his R@@ ete@@ am was expected . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 he had to leave a New Pfei@@ f@@ Concert concert in 2013 , there were five years later great rejo@@ icing , in which the national &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; went under . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ef@@ in Kath@@ arina Wagner is likely to have a look forward .
&quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , she had said briefly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot;
the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ or@@ f but it has also grown an understanding of its point of view .
I draw a positive reset .
Max lots is working as a volunteer
they work in their Volun@@ te@@ er year equal to several places .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the uphol@@ stery , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ys in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I have already worked in the open day @-@ day at school .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it &apos;s a nice , wide spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ term volunteer . &quot;
how does that come ?
crowd : I did Ab@@ it@@ ur .
&quot; and then a civil engineer , let us say successfully . &quot;
I have known for me that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else with people .
and then I asked me what do you do .
&quot; a social year , there is a social year , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point , maybe too . &quot;
and was it like that ?
crowd : I have collected great impressions .
&quot; in the winter semester , I will start my studies in the social system . &quot;
&quot; I will study dual , most probably do in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social job training and study in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hoch@@ schule . &quot;
is it not uncommon during the volunteer service to have several different areas of use ?
&quot; crowd : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it will probably always be on where to make his FS@@ J .
&quot; it is possible to make it possible from anti@@ d@@ sheim to youth work , in all possible fac@@ ets of social work . &quot;
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
for me this was the right thing that has mat@@ ured me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works .

EPA returns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule to suits
&quot; the US @-@ American environmental protection authorities did a decision to delay a regulation of the Government of Obama , repe@@ aled what the states are oblig@@ ated to intervene the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place a day after 15 states the agency on account of the step . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ ers 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said they show the obligation of the Agency , together with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and in mind that we respond to our state partners , &quot; said EPA leader Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA in June to determine the o@@ zone regulations , in which in part of the country &apos;s pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured in order to delay the more stringent air quality standards - to delay a year up to October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , was filed on Tuesday , and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to withdraw a wide range of environmental documents that the former President Barack Obama has imposed , as part of a wider agenda , which is to boost economic growth , according to tr@@ ump economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the back of the Democrats and nature conservation groups which concerns the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the website of EPA says that the inhal@@ ing of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; the pul@@ mon@@ ing function &quot; &quot; as such as as@@ thma . &quot;
communal space wants common space
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : in two oppos@@ ites the council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ ds set up the establishment of a joint space in the future seniors . &quot;
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing plot is signed by Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
&quot; although it is still going to last , until the so far the church community belonging to the church , there is no planning for the project to get from a private investor to st@@ em@@ ing project . &quot;
there is a discussion regarding a common space .
&quot; one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , has offered to meet the community . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living area of approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the management and the majority of the council float float before , such a common space is not as a meeting point only for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ righteous living , but to enter into the congregation . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word made of &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; the lap . &quot;
&quot; the decision is decided by the provision of funds for the current budget already last autumn , by funding opportunities . &quot;
the building is located in the san@@ itation area .
&quot; the establishment of a joint space would be , thus reports T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the proposed proposal looks to sign@@ alize the investor that in this respect you don &apos;t want to throw a bil@@ lets between the legs , indicating that both saddle - what has been taken to the environment - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - which makes the tear @-@ height and the construction of economic power - is possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less , not just Wil@@ fred Soh@@ mer , be this addition . &quot;
when &apos;s helps : unanim@@ ously does it happen to the body .
not so easy goes to the common room .
&quot; Daniela Call indicates the many own buildings with which you are not so right now , for this reason one can now go out of the common room out of the window , she says , &quot; I do not make me hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger absolutely speaks for the common room - however absolutely against a municipal participation .
it looks behind it a covered sub@@ strate on any high or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not so , because with the acquisition of the surface you do not give any supplement , but also get a real , in a doubt market equivalent , is the counter @-@ speech . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ers &apos;s request , to claim the proposed proposal in accordance with it , finds three advocates . &quot;
&quot; thus , it remains in two counter@@ votes at the original program , the Stefan H@@ alles summ@@ arising so : &quot; &quot; when we hold the decision , we make a huge step ahead to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;

hiking in the Har@@ z from Stern to Stern
in Har@@ z the nationwide first &quot; star path &quot; arise .
this is planning the association Stern@@ warte Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a planet path is in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; come to the information of many res@@ is@@ lets , named it . &quot;
&quot; connecting with nature , science , movement and sports performance . &quot;
the members want to set up along the planned route and inform themselves about stars and ast@@ er@@ is@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase up to 2018 , the association is planning well @-@ reaching installations at five to six places &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; question came from St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß und Sie@@ ber . &quot;
the information on the tables should be supple@@ mented by the internet .
&quot; therefore , in the selection of the selection of a good mobile network welcome , plays a role . &quot;
also accessibility is a crit@@ erion .
later the star path should be extended by train .
&quot; on the star path the spect@@ ator learn a lot of knowledge about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; stated the association . &quot;
&quot; they also learned why stars different colors would have , or why a star is stronger than another , even though it is far more distant . &quot;
conve@@ ys in which constellation can I find a chosen star and when he is best to see .
the association has been operating at the Berg@@ städ@@ t St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 .
the location in the centre of the National Park Har@@ z is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany at the heart of the German National Park .
frequently from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ meda galaxy with naked eye clearly visible .
&quot; in the UNI @-@ city , since 2003 , there has been an initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Gött@@ ingen something similar to the planned star @-@ fle@@ a - the planet path . &quot;
&quot; beginning in front of Geb@@ har@@ d Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path leads up to Hain@@ berg and the observatory - as well as an &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ ards ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
&quot; the pa@@ wns with the individual planets , including that of the Zwerg@@ plann@@ ers degra@@ ded Plu@@ to at the end point - are precisely placed on the distance and scale of one to two billion . &quot;
&quot; the earth shr@@ ink so on a sphere of 6,@@ 5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun sets exactly 75 meters from the sun at least 70 cen@@ tim@@ etres . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
&quot; while the light is required from sun to Plu@@ to for about eight hours , pedest@@ rians takes a good hour to the stops with Plu@@ to . &quot;
pedestrian are therefore faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next Fi@@ x@@ stern but would last half a year .

four injured to tire Plat@@ zer
&quot; during an accident on the A7 , four people were killed on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira from 16.@@ 30 am shortly before the junction market , probably after a tyre plat@@ ter in control of his vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the passenger desc@@ ended to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ struck himself and then lying on the roof in the green strip . &quot;
the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children - were badly injured during the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A7 in the direction of North for about an hour was locked , then traffic on the left lane could pass by accident . &quot;
Fort@@ un@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; Trinity works better
&quot; Andre Hoffmann hopes for 2 : 2 to the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that the optimization of def@@ ences in Au@@ e points brings . &quot;
&quot; with the first season of the season , Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , they would not have been the two opponents at 2 : 2 vs. Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ers too much , and we must fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; says the def@@ ender of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the three @-@ climb is also further optimized .
and a gate after a fri@@ ght will not want to catch any more .
&quot; for the future , it will be that no longer is next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his crew is better able to cope with the experience in preparation with the three @-@ chain , than with the qu@@ artet . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; says his coach Gra@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is confident to his cause , &quot; &quot; because we have just in the three @-@ positions on the semi @-@ positions at Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ mann player who can build up well , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; prerequisite is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ ising and we do not afford so many play@@ back errors . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann moves to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if one cannot talk after a draw from a mis@@ sl@@ ated start , does not know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could quite be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we stand on Sunday with four points and we can concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly talk of a decent season op@@ ener . &quot;
of that his coach wanted nothing to know .
&quot; after the start of the season , I had only after six to eight playing days , &quot; &quot; Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be dis@@ continued because of a storm . &quot;
&quot; now they can virtually start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believes that players out of Au@@ e might even be something fresh , since they couldn &apos;t have he@@ avier and full game like Fort@@ una against a Ascension in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know so 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; says the interior of the Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; indeed , guests from the Rhein@@ land go to an easy favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we take it away , only because we have the right to get under the first six , is gl@@ it@@ eness , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet at only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games is quite positive . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga , which you have to hit by advance , &quot; explains Fort@@ un@@ as Chief coach . &quot;
&quot; such a statement would be arrogan@@ t , and super@@ fici@@ ally . &quot;
and so she wants to experience his players on Sunday on Sunday .
new results published by Swedish asylum @-@ evaluation tests
&quot; the latest findings of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden have been subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that over 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authority for for@@ en@@ sic medicine ( E@@ nig@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has started carrying out tests last year .
&quot; they should make the assessment of the age more accurately during the asylum process after the Swedish migration authority ( migr@@ atory ) was critici@@ zed because of errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees , the under@@ age group . &quot;
&quot; until today , there has been migr@@ atory cases to date and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older .
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person is &quot; possibly under the age of 18 .
tests will only be conducted in cases where the person &apos;s age is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Go@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are stable over the past months . &quot;
&quot; we do not see any major difference in statistics of past months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases where the person was judged over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seekers has been aged over his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the Agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases giving the &quot; propose person 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the paper S@@ ven@@ ska D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det studied the results of 5@@ 81 results , she noted that in the 243 of these cases the person had said openly that she will be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical assessment , with x @-@ ray recordings of woven and MR@@ I recordings are made by Kni@@ fe , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they went earlier or later as usual by pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
assessing the biological age in this way is very unsafe .
&quot; if we cannot say it safely , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult is low . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are moving well .
&quot; on Wednesday , there was a seven tons of emphasis on the bridge on the eastern local entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold L@@ asi@@ ly , building manager at the Department of street @-@ beings and Transport in the Executive Board of Freiburg . &quot;
in April the work began simultaneously on all three san@@ itation bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; the construction is planned for October , and E@@ asi@@ ly is sure that the schedule is maintained . &quot;
&quot; coming the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ ault bridge made of concrete , which is disgu@@ ised with red bun@@ ts@@ stone and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; as the other two bridges also , she has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; to ensure the stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly re@@ formed . &quot;
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built in red bun@@ ts@@ stein stone .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , and 10 : 60 meters long . &quot;
the bridge at the entrance to the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now received a 1,@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called br@@ ück@@ els . &quot;
&quot; this is a random pattern , which is also used as a working path . &quot;
&quot; on the southern part of the bridge , a 2,@@ 20 meters wide b@@ yp@@ assing can be inserted on Friday . &quot;
then there should be the pedestrian wal@@ k@@ way .
&quot; the special thing is that it is about finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented b@@ yp@@ es .
special finger@@ tips has required the laying of lines by the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; because there is also a glass @-@ fibre , connected to many companies . &quot;
the inhabitants were informed in advance of the work by hand@@ outs concerning the project .
&quot; in addition , fish and cr@@ abs had to be folded . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building site and the gathering in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , the traffic is regulated by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; building on the bridge at Lau@@ ter@@ bacher local entrance is the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the &quot; &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Si@@ eving Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; fully locked . &quot;
the cost of the three Br@@ ück@@ ens@@ ory amounts to 700 000 euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : protest in protest with German potato salad
&quot; it does not occur so frequently that parties tend to pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to bring to a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ W@@ G , left ) belong to a broad coalition that shows a peaceful flag on this day because the Af@@ ales in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell invites to the &quot; &quot; great electoral campaigns &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start brings - like Alice Wei@@ del , which together with Alexander Gau@@ land is the leading candidate for the Bundestag on 24 September , and Vice @-@ Chairman of the Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those , who are on site already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ d people , but to demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally the town @-@ picnic was planned under the motto &quot; &quot; All at a table &quot; &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now takes place in the parking below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and therefore directly in front of those who come to the Af@@ ales event in the Stad@@ thalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers itself here .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , President of the Forums One World and one of the organizers organis@@ ers , really pleased : &quot; great how many people came here together . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D without any problem , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him with us . &quot;
&quot; the police has developed many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence mainly at the railway station , which is only a few metres from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ d have actually come up on Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
&quot; Mario Hom@@ es reported from the Af@@ o@@ volcan@@ ei@@ fel , he tried to make such an event and got the supplement . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked at first in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation , because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ ch not enough parking available . &quot;
&quot; so now the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ es is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; he says : &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; it also does : against 20 o &apos;clock the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz is taking a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle several Red@@ ner , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pf@@ al@@ gic Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Junge . &quot;

&quot; unchanged is the police presence , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; something more than an hour will take the Af@@ D event , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but also there it is short after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can ab@@ rupt - no special incidents .

both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and winners from numerous international competitions and have won sol@@ opo@@ si@@ tions in European leading orches@@ tras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is at the prestigious Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ down is the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both desire the desire to cross not only the limits on their instruments , but also merge the limits of different genres . &quot;

this center@@ piece of the program was first presented with ri@@ esi@@ ght success in Freiburg .

Kr@@ isten Ste@@ wart talks about their bis@@ exual sides
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their life .
&quot; but I want to try out everything , &quot; &quot; so Kr@@ isten Ste@@ wart completely open about their bis@@ exual . &quot;
&quot; when I get dressed in grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot;
the well @-@ known relationship of the Hol@@ ly@@ re stars was that of her &quot; t@@ wilight &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson &apos;s who was ultimately bitter .
&quot; despite all this ass@@ ures the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin opposite the &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; I was very fond of everyone I &apos;ve posted . &quot;
&quot; or do you believe , I could have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation , Kr@@ isten gave to that she is bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed du@@ alism . &quot;
so it has never been confused or disabled .
&quot; I just liked it , not taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; especially among them , she suffered noisy &quot; &quot; Bang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; but in school time , when she preferred like a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really has been very hurt .
&quot; when I was eleven , I told me the children , I would look like a bu@@ b . &quot;
I really felt attacked , frightened and ashamed . &quot;
&quot; I look back and think : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
especially the public they don &apos;t like to live their love life : &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and upset me .
&quot; and perhaps some call me un@@ grateful , but I don &apos;t like to justify it to the public eye . &quot;
governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic Governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night at a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; Governor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today , I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thinking ... today , I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can no longer help if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration for Re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; Justice added . &quot;
&quot; as a trainer , I would say that it is time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a great announcement in the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice bil@@ te not the democratic candidate Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state according to For@@ bes was elected in 2016 .
&quot; For@@ bes establishes that he has coal mines in five countries , and inherited from his father a coal @-@ business . &quot;
it is worth $ 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday night had an explanation , in which it said : &quot; &quot; the party change of Governor Justice is another blow to a democratic party that would rather prevent us than working to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 governors and the control of the least legislative bodies in history is the announcement of Governor Justice only the final rejection of a party , which is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , lonely message , &quot; said R@@ NC @-@ President Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in a statement about the CB@@ S News . &quot;
co@@ e lo@@ ops &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing scandal
&quot; the global leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a D@@ oping scandal but he repeated , unless the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed again . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics leader Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ h said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the athle@@ tics World Championships , that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he is determined to fight the dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; he said , I am sorry for &quot; all athletes , who were carved from competitions and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments the ILO Convention for the maintenance of the ban , which in November 2015 was agreed , after a report of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) found evidence of state @-@ sponsored d@@ oping in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF president Co@@ e the re@@ porters . &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has seen in itself , that she has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; he said , he was also &quot; pleased &quot; that Russia was accepting the criteria for his re @-@ introduction . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been achieved , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot;
&quot; the principle principle was always that we wanted to separate the Clean athletes from the corrupt system , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; ninete@@ en Russian athletes are scheduled for the athle@@ tics World Championships , which will start on Friday in London , based on strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors . &quot;
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia still needed some of the criteria for re @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; Dro@@ er tests are still inadequate and neglected coach are still free , he said re@@ porters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
funeral act for in Mali N@@ ür@@ ted soldiers
&quot; at a funeral celebration at the North @-@ eastern Frit@@ z@@ lar , approximately 1000 people were thought of the two at a helicopter crash in Mali Um@@ ge@@ o soldiers . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
&quot; to still un@@ resolved , Defence Minister Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing . &quot;
&quot; she called the two Um@@ ge@@ es , but as &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their professional . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we tend to have the highest victim in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; she stated . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ year Major and the 47 @-@ year St@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen had come alive on Wednesday a week in the West African Mali .
her sister were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Cathedral Saint Peter .
&quot; at mid@@ day , first of all , only the relatives were in the church farewell . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , the closest friends , of representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics . &quot;
these were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the Administrator @-@ inspec@@ tors of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; trau@@ ma cast ro@@ ses ro@@ ses , the relatives stood by arm in arm at the rope . &quot;
in front of the church Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ es and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
the Le@@ yen &apos;s defence of the Le@@ yen marked the as@@ cer@@ ated soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and ch@@ atting .
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann had built the plane of the batt@@ le@@ ub@@ bers tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six skilled tiger pilots of his reg@@ iment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the Reg@@ iment , said to which the soldiers belong , stated : &quot; &quot; if this crew did not turn the crash , it could not have wasted . &quot;
&quot; doubt at the UN Mission in Mali , Minister of Le@@ yen not shown : the use is dangerous . &quot;
&quot; but he is also of the high significance , &quot; for a land from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
after the funeral party the sag@@ ging were brought out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr made no information . &quot;
prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ ts ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried with his wife next to his wife . &quot;
this shared the Royal House on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish Royal Mat@@ ar is attached to the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard has already made a Sark@@ op@@ ha@@ g for the two .
&quot; the queen was agreed with the decision of her husband , his name was continued in the message . &quot;
where prince Hen@@ rik become buried is still unclear .
but he did not have the intent to be attached in his French homeland .
Prinz Hen@@ rik had never made a ehl from it that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne ascent of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ den in 1972 he would like to have king .
&quot; in 2016 , he went into retirement and also places the title &quot; Prin@@ c@@ esses &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted , he does not see himself as equal to his wife - neither after death , L@@ ene Ballet , the chief of the Danish royal house . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will be , be still unclear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not have the intent to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
&quot; the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French Cypri@@ ot , had met in London in 1965 . &quot;
at the Thames he worked in the French embassy .
&quot; during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people always flew , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy level with the Dan@@ es during his nearly 50 years . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography E@@ rik about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was pregnant , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk str@@ aps instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Vol@@ vo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ wing , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco and the call of this country to be the brand of socially critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of any majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; Nieder@@ sach@@ sens Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green governmental majority for a swift re@@ election of the country &apos;s day , but does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
because the Parliament spoke out on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament .
&quot; previously , the surprising res@@ ignation of a Green parliament@@ arians from their country @-@ state parliament in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official appointment of the Sunday elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scarce A @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the old Green MP El@@ ke T@@ west founded their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election 2018 in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( whale ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she declared on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
CD@@ U President Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend to his faction to record them .
&quot; in this way , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats at 69 seats in the German @-@ Sax@@ on land , SPD and Green 68 . &quot;
so far the relationship was the other way round .
the new land@@ day will be regular on 14 January next year .
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green country government should now decide whether to rule in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l considers it essential , however , that the land &apos;s day is rapidly accelerating its self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on Tuesday through her next procedure .
the State Constitution also sees the possibility that the country &apos;s parliament draws confidence and choose a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these possibilities must be tested thoroughly clean , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; it will discuss all the questions in peace , if they are legally checked . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler named T@@ wes@@ ens step &quot; nevertheless somewhat cur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the politicians himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
it described itself as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Greens demanded the dep@@ ent dep@@ uties for the return of their country day .
&quot; we of course assume that she has received her agricultural day , which has received her over the green country list , with immediate effect returns , &quot; shared the provincial Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
the presidents of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ong@@ ated extra@@ ordinarily . &quot;
she deliberately decided to lead no pron@@ unciation in the Group .
&quot; even in the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot trace this step . &quot;
SPD @-@ Chancellor Martin Schulz condemned the superiority of the non @-@ Sax@@ on green @-@ MPs El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to CD@@ U as betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green parliament@@ arians in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the voters and voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the Chief of Social Democrats on Facebook on Facebook . &quot;
&quot; he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , to restart the land day quickly . &quot;
the ex@@ iting T@@ wes@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; the political head office &quot; &quot; in its ver@@ final van@@ ity and in her fr@@ ust put her personal interests in front of the welfare of the country , &quot; critici@@ zed SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot;
&quot; it is a scandal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony takes this dirty game and tries to beat its political capital . &quot;
Nieder@@ ad@@ sens CD@@ U @-@ Leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its MEPs to include El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests in the CD@@ U .
&quot; the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw its v@@ ests , with personal career and di@@ stract the result of the Sunday election 2013 . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was then in front of the SPD strong power , SPD and Green had a hau@@ ghty majority in the country but a hau@@ ghty majority of one voice . &quot;
&quot; agricultural Minister in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves against tox@@ ins , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discusses about contaminated eggs .
how could the scandal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
agricultural Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in the interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt and How can consumers protect themselves from poison@@ ing ?
I can only encourage all consumers and consumers to accurately watch the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stun@@ k pressure .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ di@@ .de , the Bundes@@ länder will put up the latest information on the affected egg @-@ bat@@ ches each . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if , after all we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded . &quot;
now Al@@ di takes over the best crisis action - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of enligh@@ tening from the Federal Minister of Economy is not really perceived ?
the food surveillance is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has been un@@ locked immediately and since the announcement of Germany &apos;s interest in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade has just as well as the manufacturers to bear care that the sold @-@ selling products are safe and wholesome .
&quot; if the resi@@ dual content of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are non @-@ restricted . &quot;
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time is not the factories to blame .
are production facilities and consumers in the same boat ?
after a high level of knowledge the production facilities makes no immediate fault .
&quot; rather , they have to reck@@ on due to mut@@ ably illegal practices of services companies with economic damages . &quot;
as always there is too little controversi@@ es on the crop .
is it only lacking on the staff or at the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
but the official controls have just been revealed .
&quot; in truth , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded to 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; it is precisely because of this , a consequ@@ ent education of such events and the commit to the pro@@ secut@@ ors in the cases where criminal off@@ ences are available , of crucial importance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have clearly made a number of times that I would expect an incomplete education from the responsible authorities . &quot;
is the regular alarm system at food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to only get safe and secure food .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers and consumers are rightly outra@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; the pan@@ elled means are manufacturers , dealers and consumers into a situation which is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ feed animals is unacceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately . &quot;
it has to be consistent on all levels and worked with high pressure .
I expect all competent authorities to explain the fact that the fact is rapidly and un@@ brid@@ led .
how the financial rules of football on Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
&quot; the rules , which aim to prevent the un@@ ch@@ ained issues of the European foot@@ ball@@ ers will not distur@@ b Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain by the UEF@@ A , because the leading organization that the European game has supervised the power , teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules , which were launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A must mean that P@@ SG had to point out some time , that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar has been financed without great losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million Euros ) to purchase the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary which will be tens of ten million dollars per year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
&quot; P@@ SG can certainly make money easy , so Ne@@ ym@@ ar testi@@ fied and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the Team through the energy rich ruling family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; associations are allowed to apply a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but they must have a legitimate acquisition , which allow them to make the break @-@ even point in their own football business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
&quot; former French players believed that clubs that had enormous debt in their quest for success , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ki@@ ated to ruin , if banks or owners returned their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P declined from concentration on the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses . &quot;
the change meant that the business model that the novel Abr@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch was originally used in 2003 - a club with potential and then strongly invested to build the team and build a global brand - to become a tougher matter .
&quot; during the current three year @-@ old FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses up to 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini had fallen from the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade 2015 , his UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ an continues to be deter@@ red by excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will continue to intensify the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible at UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week . &quot;
&quot; although the P@@ SG paid the buy @-@ out clause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a package , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of his contract . &quot;
Ne@@ ym@@ ar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the sol@@ vents can be rejected for the next five years in the amount of 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million in the annual financial statements .
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has made the P@@ SG together with Abu Dhabi which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ SG received a penalty of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which later was reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the Mann@@ it@@ ts members are limited for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 player . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to over@@ see their financial statements by connecting their revenue by companies , which are connected to the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a Catalan company could sponsor the P@@ SG , if the value of the sponsorship should exceed the standard mark@@ er , the UEF@@ A would not apply this as a legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; that was exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the P@@ SA was paraly@@ zed by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that a part of the P@@ SG @-@ payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar will be held on payments by the organization Committee of the World Cup in Qatar .
but P@@ SG and Qatar 2022 denied that Ne@@ ym@@ ar Cup ambassador will be able to find out and a der@@ @-@ like maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities can be easily found .
&quot; the previous sanctions against P@@ SG mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive at any attempt to observe the rules .
&quot; the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with P@@ SG via Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Transfer , say on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press since they were not authorised to discuss the P@@ SG situation .
the last published reports show that P@@ SG 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year will have to be published .
&quot; P@@ SG expects that Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s arrive a blessing for sponsorship De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ ck@@ ellers . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 per cent after the signing of the signing .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly mistaken to see one of the best football players to see , and she tried to prevent ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s way@@ ward by claiming that P@@ SG would inj@@ ure the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Kat@@ ars the owner of P@@ SG . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state which has financed an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it will be very difficult to respect the finan@@ ci@@ elle Fair@@ play , because one can go different ways or have different interests , if a country has such a great player to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is searching for a new shock supplier
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board chocolate has made for the Swiss .
now it is possible to work together in front of a possible end : the airline is writing the order anew .
&quot; Swiss @-@ speaker in Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency SD@@ A , a corresponding report of the &quot; &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; &quot; newspaper . &quot;
&quot; according to current planning , the Air@@ line will launch a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be reviewed every two to three years and subjected it to quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ person . &quot;
some 17 million small red @-@ white sho@@ gg@@ it@@ af@@ ers to divide up to 14 grams per year before landing to the passengers .
at the cost Swiss no information wanted to do .
&quot; industry in@@ sider value the order volume according to &quot; North@@ western &quot; &quot; to 1.5 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot;
&quot; however , more importantly , the advertising effect is : for a shock manufacturer , it is a prestigious contract . &quot;
&quot; as many applicants there are in the new tender , Swiss will not want to betra@@ y . &quot;
but only Swiss manufacturers come to question .
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make a renewal of the contract beyond the spring 2018 . &quot;
for the SD@@ A the largest Swiss chocolate producer was not available for opinion .
chocolate boards spread the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
&quot; before Swiss completed a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has delivered in cooperation with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets . &quot;
&quot; the possibility to place the logo , Swiss Life conducted two and a half years with the start of the cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
&quot; long @-@ haul flights will be pampered by the First Class with goodies from the Con@@ fis@@ erie J@@ gli , in the Business Class nas@@ al passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i of Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;

&quot; this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gically because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ er years , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( as the for@@ den@@ ker David W@@ ain and Michael Sho@@ wal@@ ter the Sk@@ et@@ ch @-@ Com@@ edy &apos; The State &quot; for M@@ TV rot@@ ten ) , and for itself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd to larger things . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally an o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era permanent memories . &quot;
&quot; but as a franchise , it feels like the time would be short . &quot;
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd lob@@ bies ( it contained a original story for a speaking d@@ osis vegetable that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
by playing on the core of the g@@ ags - actors middle @-@ age are vacc@@ inated children who will grow up - they still managed the im@@ possibility to get the last part of the Wit@@ ch .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , with his adults , which are now playing adults is less emotion@@ ally rooted and its par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the defeat @-@ principle , including a reef on the stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ he years , like &quot; The Hand of Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; &quot; ( &quot; The Hand , which the cradle ch@@ elt &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; at a point st@@ ö@@ bert a character through a Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates and &apos; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , now Roman@@ tic , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ e@@ au ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not yet lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; and there is another crazy mali@@ cious P@@ lot , included in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Sho@@ for@@ ter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
as always the ex@@ courses are the best part of the franchise .
&quot; it makes a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt D@@ os sub @-@ beard of &quot; singles , &quot; the former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; there are the moments of random madness , which might show this franchise like a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he achieved what I will show as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; the last scene which will show the film premiere of &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; at Amazon meanwhile reminded of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to rev@@ itali@@ zing the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; at the film &quot; Atom@@ ic B@@ lon@@ de &quot; and even on &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ West @-@ West @-@ fight @-@ icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the com@@ edy of Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka created com@@ edy with Rh@@ ys Thomas as a director , a fake TV series with the two poli@@ c@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who are fighting for truth , athe@@ ism and the path of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;
the main wheels - a hard sc@@ ot@@ ten@@ er Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i the di@@ alogs of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt to be syn@@ ced .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags for watching ( the police spends the time to watch chess on TV how Americans maybe do with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Find out the voice &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is very committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda race - a mur@@ derer that carries a Re@@ agan mask , is involved - that it is often like a single one . &quot;
&quot; at six long episodes , the com@@ edy will move , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , which was reproduced at a smaller length , could deliver his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ S@@ ati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American embassy , whose Lobby is always occupied by two big men who are le@@ ased a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the dark @-@ communist audience is that Western culture can make everything for food for a gel .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian creators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with theirs .
blow against drugs @-@ Mafia in the country
police is a blow to the Italian Mafia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , const@@ ancy , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched out , as the Public Pro@@ secutor &apos;s Office on Friday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 25 , 15 signs were arrested in the age between 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warrant against them . &quot;
&quot; the officials put greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , as well as several hundred thousand Euros . &quot;
at the same swe@@ eps in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Italians there were German Ar@@ rest War@@ rant .
therefore the two will probably be delivered to Germany .
in the action Italian and Bav@@ arian investig@@ ators were involved .
a total of over 300 c@@ emen were deployed in action .
&quot; the Mafia &apos;s members of the Mafia is accused of organized drug criminal , heavy violence , trying murder , as well as rob@@ bery and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; even since summer 2016 , the pro@@ secutor &apos;s office will be determined against organised drug trade in the South German region . &quot;
&quot; between the pro@@ secut@@ ors in Constance and Palermo , there was a br@@ isk exchange and the investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the large use on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; in the sight of the investigations , the investigations carried out mainly Italian citizens with regard to the Italian ma@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; a incident on May 27th , in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired in a restaurant in the morning , is likely to go to the bank account of the gang . &quot;
how do large gaps in the foreig@@ ner register
&quot; data from citizens that should not appear : &quot; &quot; according to a report , the foreig@@ ner register in Germany has considerable shortcomings . &quot;
the lead to partly serious failures of asylum seekers .
&quot; according to the supervis@@ ors for the refugee management of the federal government , Frank @-@ Jürgen ( German federal government ) , a media report pointed out attention to large gaps in the de@@ centr@@ alist register . &quot;
&quot; defects associated with the registered data could lead to asylum seekers and de@@ port@@ ations &quot; to some serious mis@@ decisions &quot; , &quot; warned in an analysis that the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the register , the information according to ten million people with foreign citizenship are reported , among them some 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU states . &quot;
the data is therefore managed by about 600 emi@@ grants in Germany .
&quot; because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts has so far been not good . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; of people who have long been no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens , and actually no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data inser@@ tions can significantly slow @-@ down processes , &quot; it says the report . &quot;
&quot; in statistics on out@@ travelling people , the EU citizens should not be recorded at all , who would not have to travel at all . &quot;
&quot; but , such an incorrect debate led to a distorted debate on how to deal with emigr@@ ate , &quot; therefore , it means in analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the federal government has obviously started to send refugee families with less than 16 @-@ year @-@ old children again to Italy , if they arrived from there . &quot;
&quot; this goes out from an internal paper of the Federal Ministry for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BAM@@ F ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ re newspaper . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the paper , the BAM@@ F lead such procedures &quot; related to families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper had a reference to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; following the Dublin treaty , it is responsible for refugees of the EU state that they first achieve . &quot;
&quot; when a migr@@ ant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the travelling country . &quot;
&quot; reasoning for the Office now : &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the recording capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy increased significantly . &quot;
Italy received guarantees for the admission and accommodation of families guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( E@@ GM@@ R ) consider these commitments to be sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back to the Dublin Trade Agreement .
&quot; the underlying political spokes@@ person in the Bundestag , U@@ lla jel@@ p@@ ke , critici@@ zed this decision : &quot; &quot; families with children are im@@ min@@ ated because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system human illegal reception and a threat to the child . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 lit@@ re of blood of the people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach people were already available for other people .
&quot; at least from the twelve citizens , which were awarded on Friday . &quot;
&quot; thanks to all Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who now divided over 100 lit@@ re of blood with his now 100 donations . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the congregation in the session of the Municipal Council provide multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is awesome , as our body is laid out for it and we respect the donations that provide their blood for foreigners , nor un@@ selfish , &quot; underlined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood @-@ consuming helps several people , &quot; explained the roundabout of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , because the con@@ tain@@ ees are de@@ composed into their constitu@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; in this way , three people could benefit from a blood@@ shed . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported about the promotions that are carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result , &quot; said the DR@@ K rot@@ ate managers . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the theatre was led to higher number of participants only a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; before before , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Con@@ sho@@ cks were awarded to the multi@@ f@@ ences and were awarded for 50 learned blood@@ shed . &quot;
&quot; half as many book Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ ro@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefan@@ ie St@@ oll and Uwe Alzen ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their habitat . &quot;
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; the Bank of England will likely later be announced that interest rates will remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation in the spec@@ ulations of inflation . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; s@@ lugg@@ ish &quot; , &quot; when they conven@@ ed the interest rates on family @-@ income in the middle of a intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot;
&quot; the policy makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to hold the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , whereby weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quarterly review , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on income will continue , whereby inflation in the autumn is expected to rise up to almost 3 % . &quot;
&quot; however , it sign@@ alized that in the coming years of inser@@ ting inflation would be necessary to breed the inflation of Bre@@ xit and she said that credit costs may require more than expected to rise to the financial markets . &quot;
members also voted to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut &apos;s economic package which was published before a year after the Bre@@ xit .
&quot; it will request time for finance plan to provide budget funding for banks , although it is expected that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the scope of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after deciding on interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central prognosis of the M@@ PC the gross product ( GDP ) remains weak , since the pressure on the real income of households continues to be charged the consumption . &quot;
&quot; on the interest rates , it repeated that &quot; a certain degree of monetary policy &quot; would be required for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; somewhat bigger &quot; scale than the markets expect . &quot;
the markets anticip@@ ates the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank stressed that &quot; &quot; gradually &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are predicted 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the growth forecasts for this and next year .
it has maintained its growth forecasts to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.@@ 4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
&quot; the decision to no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have risen to increase the rising expectations , and GDP increased by 0.2 % in the previous three months in the previous three months . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected to increase in the third quarter at 0.@@ 3 % , although it will easily recover after the Bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent in@@ flow report offered little enthusiasm for households , which will be affected by an increasing inflation and low levels of salary since the ti@@ ghtening is first even worse before it may improve . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy cannot be avoided in the next few years , but she added that wages to the end of her three @-@ year pre@@ diction . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also reinforced by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound weight , which will compens@@ ate for a portion of lower consumption expendi@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes a year after lowering the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August following the shocking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ ister of the lease . &quot;
the bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will achieve the prices and the economy fully .
&quot; prior to the last judgment of the bank to the interest rates , the call has risen after an exchange increase , since inflation increased pressure on hard households , with three policy makers in July a rise in 0.5 % demanded . &quot;
&quot; inflation is decreased last month from 2,@@ 9 % in June to 2,@@ 6 % , although the Bank predicted that this was anticipated and will put it on in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said the exceed@@ ance in relation to their goal of 2 % be &quot; entirely to the weak pound weight .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ ying Bro@@ ker , said : &quot; &quot; in view of the recent return of the s@@ wap arrangements , the mort@@ gage market is likely to look very competitive and end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing De@@ als run out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is intended to prescri@@ be controversial HIV @-@ drug 10,000 people
patients will be obtained from September after a fight against the drug in N@@ HS access to a &apos; transform@@ ative &apos; HIV prevention treatment .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that one prior to the intercourse recorded predic@@ tive prophy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) , which may reduce the risk of risk associated with high @-@ risk copies , now by health service to a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 persons . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the process after the Appe@@ al Tribunal had confirmed a judgement of the Supreme Court of Justice last year , after the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the Pr@@ EP in spite of the asser@@ tion that local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; the chess release announced on Thursday , was welcomed by N@@ HS England leader Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; during the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) that referred to as &quot; crucial moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be the first to follow the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced to England in April 2018 . &quot;
prevention of prevention ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV medicines that will be taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP is significantly reduced to HIV transmission in infection .
taking the Pr@@ EP in front of the intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who come for treatment in question include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; clinics are identified suitable participants who agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known as anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and registered at a physician can also opt @-@ in for possible participation in their local participating dental clinic .
the programme will signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the supply of medicines this week after an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of Pr@@ EP by evaluating clinical evidence , as applied in a large scale , and is implemented and implemented . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should supplement the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV prevention . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in dealing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ EP , if targeted towards needy people , offers the possibility to change the English HIV epidemic . &quot;
&quot; from September to people people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England have to develop a new instrument , which is really individually controlled and not associated with a negotiation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is quickly carried out throughout the country and that no one who has left a risk for HIV . &quot;
&quot; now , since the Pr@@ EP test medicine was created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , shadow @-@ health Minister , said : &quot; &quot; the start of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome after months of delays and hesit@@ ant execution through the government and over@@ due . &quot;
the evidence show how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us one step closer to the understanding of the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect individuals who are infected with HIV , and that it will contribute to the end of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
the big life live : mezz@@ anine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment to a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , reduced from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a test@@ ament to the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed their bags and sold .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; I searched for something that was comparable to my price . &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
I loved it in love and made a quote on this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first viewing , the 1,000 square feet was completely over@@ hau@@ led large apartment . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room estate with a snow@@ y layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne reservoir and a mezz@@ anine to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; this was my request , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , they commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed from Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , which was 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home which was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms in each other , so the architectural challenge was to create a mezz@@ anine in which one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think creative to solve the hand@@ over .
&quot; the steel plant is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were over@@ thrown each other , without having to push us . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to set the steel so that it had the right height above or at the bottom . &quot;
this alignment made it possible for Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with much extra drama .
for the mezz@@ anine looks a classic copper window of ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us down over the glam@@ orous living area .
&quot; mir@@ r@@ ored gold @-@ furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
at both ends a short corridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to make it longer .
the kitchen feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance it offers space for all the stocks and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; due to the perception of a glam@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel reinforced , fur@@ ni@@ fied M@@ DF @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; it is very important , so it is when you push the door very easily , very easily . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain extra 16 sqm , an additional bedroom and improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day , you will sell the basics - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a rudi@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the bottom size . &quot;
&quot; here , they managed to enlarge the ground floor and at the same time use high quality materials which give the room to its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and who therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not love yourself in the electric plu@@ gs in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by good design and increased square footage of some standard into something quite unusual .
&quot; in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave this . &quot;
brothers are fighting for a 500 million US dollars
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in an examination because of one of the biggest property imperial Vict@@ ori@@ as valued more than 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton football club &apos; and developers Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul removed . this one has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their capacity shall be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to retreat from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp examination of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers also possess 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street , Col@@ ling@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; in there , the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail business . &quot;
it was sold in 1999 to 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as m@@ alls in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; following an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; chief operator and the dominating personality &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis described - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
a judicial system states that this means that Col@@ in property has a value of 3@@ 16 million dollars and Paul worth $ 17@@ 6 million .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul as a problem .
&quot; the organizations proposed by Col@@ in proposed orders have left him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; wrote in 2015 in a first affair . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed plac@@ ements took place the first hearing of the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; the brothers now fight for control of the existing business - both Col@@ in , as Paul maintains it out of him . &quot;
&quot; argued , this is not true , it is not true , but raises Paul prior to ad@@ minister some possessions . &quot;
&quot; in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it that was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hope to enter the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cost increases in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides of law . &quot;
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the dairy bars and delic@@ acy transactions conducted in the late 1950 @-@ he years and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick . &quot;
they used the security to purchase the Col@@ ling@@ wood property in which col@@ on opened the first jewel of the family .
&quot; Col@@ in says that he began West@@ co , when he was in high school in my last years , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoping to admit their property to their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to land the brethren , &quot; &quot; wrote them . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no more part of De Lu@@ tis @-@ group of companies , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark have paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark are , so Paul says bitter@@ ness about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in has kept very back , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of the television stars . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their attor@@ neys .
&quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; I really cannot say a lot , &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and to draw our family name by the dishes , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of 2016 , Col@@ in wrote to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father would not have thought that Paul and I would end in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; he said and added that he was still hoping for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot;
Tr@@ umps of new Staff is planning to restrict the media hos@@ st@@ in@@ ence of the President .

&quot; Poli@@ tico reports that the new Chief of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow to President Tr@@ ump , including reports from the news media - hoping to keep the boss on an even bigger course . &quot;
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of the White House , met at his first working day with leading employees , he presented a main problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps of White House which he wants to fix : poor information that gets into the hands of the President . &quot;
Kelly said the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letters - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to count Tr@@ ump by monitoring its media . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ umps relationship to television ranges decades back - and now , where he is in the White House , his television is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was upset because of an unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places that were to convince , &quot; said the former election consultant Sam Nun@@ berg in February opposite Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote that &quot; &quot; the Key to hold Twitter &apos;s habit under control , according to six former electoral campaign officials to ensure that his personal media consumption involves a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that Tr@@ umps on Twitter &apos;s custom &quot; was &quot; under control &quot; , &quot; is ridiculous . &quot;
perhaps these fighting officials know something we don &apos;t know - that Tr@@ umps T@@ we@@ et would have not included even more ig@@ ni@@ es without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump did not send .
&quot; if his staff made it several times to hold anger from it , then their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; however , no one has consistently been able to prevent cr@@ ump controversi@@ es . &quot;
&quot; part of the problem consists in the fact that people in a white house consists of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by promoting tr@@ ump material that may potentially promote their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the consultants , the President of strategic reasons , without du@@ bi@@ ous information . &quot;
&quot; this was an example , which was described by re@@ porters Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher : &quot;
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump will react like a volcano on negative press sections , especially those with damaged le@@ aks and that he will find out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; that happened at the end of February , when someone had a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the internet pro@@ voc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy rod of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh to be the source behind a bunch of le@@ aks in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently ban@@ ished from Twitter or that he has offered no specific evidence , or that he vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke them . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the then director Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , tried to implement a system to manage and document the Tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as a most effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive Self , and his advis@@ er still seek to influence . &quot;
the changing factors make Kell@@ ys Mission very difficult .
Me@@ ist@@ searched criminals get post by Euro@@ pol
&quot; as the address is unknown , the help of the population will pray and hoped . &quot;
the police sent all over Europe in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous crime at the run .
&quot; since the addresses of the heav@@ en@@ bre@@ chers are not known according to , the references from the population will be hoped and pray . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action that follows the &quot; &quot; Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; Advent@@ ures of the winter . &quot;
&quot; the experiences could have shown that many flee to holiday destinations , was named by Euro@@ pol . &quot;
you have compiled 21 post@@ cards for selected criminals from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted has been available for more than 2.5 million times . &quot;
&quot; 36 The online Ges@@ e could not have been arrested until now , at least eleven of them due to indications after the publication on the website . &quot;
travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire &apos;s series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands stand again with some compensated travelers on the war , which have negotiated one of the community drawn dit@@ ch to request a field in front of their men@@ aces . &quot;
the travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a prosperous street of Soli@@ h@@ ull which is called the &quot; Million@@ aire @-@ series . &quot;
&quot; they brought with horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters , after they were dropped out in May without being sc@@ ares from one by the Council to prevent their accidents . &quot;
the tactical group found a gap in the defence systems and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it is &quot; useless &quot; to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabitants said : &quot; &quot; they were sent there on Monday night after they were sent on by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pas@@ sers @-@ by . &quot;
&quot; the Council must be forced by Sch@@ am to implement in fact , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
the travellers were there in May and were moved back and are now back .
&quot; more came yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to handle it by keeping long instructions to protect their parks .
&quot; I live on the Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my common dest@@ ini@@ es , if the Council cannot even stop it . &quot;
&quot; a inhabitants who did not want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridiculous , we just have seen the last round of these travelers just to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking area . &quot;
&quot; said a spokes@@ person in the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the shore beyond the Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so quickly as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our proof collection , it is very important that most people can report an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling on 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must check , when we present our case . &quot;
from Birken@@ hof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof there will be the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and is scheduled to be opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closing of the hotel Birken@@ hof , the ambi@@ ance of the Hotel Birken@@ hof took around 30 000 nights every year , and also revenues from the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in view of dramatically the figures of refugees , which came to the County in the country , the hotel buildings on the store office as a collective accommodation available for controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers through setting up a development plan in order to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at the time at the council .
&quot; but above all Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Ober@@ bourgeois , Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the place and said already at the time of serious interested parties in the house . &quot;
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ hotels with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof with a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of three @-@ star Plus @-@ category among the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad mines and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; you are called Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof have been at the entrance for a longer time , shortly before the entrance , and when one enters the house , clear renovation work will be made . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ ils were removed , ceilings for part ab@@ rup@@ tly , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
until March there is still a lot to do .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large wooden showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , there are new windows built . &quot;
&quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer &apos;s express . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a jewelry piece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the facilities . &quot;
&quot; one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at an up@@ scale downtown level , empha@@ sizes Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set up wide , explains be@@ ers further . &quot;
&quot; both individual holiday makers , groups or business@@ men are to feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , he already led , so Sch@@ erer . &quot;
the ideas of the city are identical to those of the hotel @-@ group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; after the amount of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer wants to determine precisely . &quot;
&quot; just under one million Euros , he reck@@ ons . &quot;
the outside installations are brought on front @-@ hand which is already clearly visible .
&quot; in a courtyard , a large terrace arises from the restaurant , which is publicly available . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : us @-@ Special bro@@ ker sets the Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair at U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump , Robert Mu@@ eller should have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury for a report . &quot;
&quot; the panel recorded the work over the past few weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; calling for confidential persons . &quot;
the paper marked the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller had expanded his investigation and intensified .
&quot; the station CN@@ N reported , there will already be the first inv@@ itations of the atrocities related to a meeting between the oldest son and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; US intelligence services acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a longer period , specifically to have turned into the presidential campaign in 2016 . &quot;
Mu@@ eller examines whether there was abstr@@ action between the m@@ umps of the election team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigation , several men are to be standing in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republi@@ can . &quot;
&quot; according to this , Mu@@ eller also reported more and more tr@@ umps private and business environment under the micro@@ scope . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special morning Tr@@ ump had moved into the center and seek the accus@@ ation , whether the President in the course of the affair may hin@@ ders justice . &quot;
&quot; the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys , is to examine and decide this evidence in possible violations of accidents , and decide whether it shall be charged . &quot;
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called accus@@ ations .
they are usually switched on when it comes to greater and controversial cases .
the procedure has always been closed behind closed doors .
the panel can also be switched from the pro@@ secutor &apos;s office to invite people to acquire under E@@ id .
&quot; according to the sender of CN@@ N already pre @-@ inv@@ itations have already been issued , which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian Federation . &quot;
individuals who were involved in the meeting were called on a statement which was called in the report .
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
beside Tr@@ ump J@@ r. also Tr@@ umps advis@@ er and in @-@ law @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his dam boss Paul Man@@ a@@ fort continued during the conversation .
&quot; right wing experts said on Thursday evening in the US television , that Mu@@ eller show that Mu@@ eller won &apos;t let themselves shy in his work and that he should be necessary to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the survey of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , at the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new cause for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the President on Thursday announced a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y Russia &apos;s affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia @-@ history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the democrats give the Democrats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else about whom they can talk about . &quot;
&quot; his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in an opinion , he wis@@ s not know anything about the suspension of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; however , this works also usually in secret , stressed . &quot;
the White House advocate all measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in a fair way .
the former F@@ BI leader James Com@@ ey has told three times that not be determined against the president .
&quot; we have no reason to assume that something has changed , it was in the explanation . &quot;
&quot; mu@@ eller , however , was only used after the dump Com@@ ey had been fired . &quot;
&quot; because of this re@@ vis@@ ing , allegations of tr@@ ump had become loud , he just want to im@@ pe@@ de the judiciary . &quot;
&quot; in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ y asked him to be hiring the investigation against the then national security advisor Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after the representation of US media the White House gathered material against the special operator and its employees .
the extingu@@ ishing spec@@ ulations about it whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller released .
&quot; unlike an independent special assembly of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , the President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has had a position in which it was theoretically possible theoretically by the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step yet .
&quot; two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented their law on Thursday , after which the special operator could no longer be released as simple . &quot;
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic ice @-@ ice is driving in Antar@@ c@@ tica
&quot; in the west Arctic , a gigantic ice of ice has solved itself from the scarce size of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ springs . &quot;
the divided Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar@@ - and marine research on Wednesday .
&quot; one tri@@ llion met@@ ric tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometer wide Kol@@ oss now moved to the north and will probably need two , three years until it mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers one of the largest ice cream , the researchers have registered in the past three decades . &quot;
a danger for people is not coming out of him .
&quot; to what extent the climate change has played a role in the erup@@ tion of the ice , is unclear . &quot;
&quot; in total , however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s of ice ho@@ fen in the region , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact @-@ background . &quot;
according to the opinion of many researchers that can be combined with warming .
the col@@ dest colleague was so far a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ springs .
Sch@@ el@@ fi@@ is swi@@ ms down on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ springs is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula .
north of this treasure @-@ circle was the balance of wax and ab@@ rupt some years ago .
&quot; a complete skir@@ mish is broken down , AW@@ I researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m talking about that even the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ i is in danger , because the more prevalent c@@ ams have never withdrawn as far as it is currently . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the ice top stand under tension and could be broken if at a key point , a piece dis@@ ks . &quot;
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ springs and ic@@ eberg increases the sea level not because they float on the water and swal@@ lowed out water as much water as it gives after the melting itself .
&quot; however , the loss of the sweat @-@ circle leads to the fact that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can flow directly to the sea and flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in the low extent , writes the British research project to observe the Antar@@ c@@ tica ( MID@@ AS ) . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ springs is according to AW@@ I data with almost 50 000 square kilometres , the fourth largest Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is of the Antar@@ c@@ tica . &quot;
&quot; on the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , on the edge @-@ edge to the free ocean about 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks out regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural happening and has no direct connection to climate change , the Eis@@ schild now comes into a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most widespread retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he confirmed . &quot;
&quot; under scientists are controversial , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ skir@@ t will again grow or go back in the long term , and possibly summ@@ ed up his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but these developments will last decades .
&quot; even though these researchers did not withdraw from the erup@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ eberg , so in recent decades many ice sm@@ el@@ ves are dis@@ rupted the ant@@ ar@@ ctic peninsula . &quot;
this long bricks of the Antar@@ c@@ tica extends towards South America .
&quot; according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the Ice area of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula has declined since the 1950s to 28 000 square kilometers . &quot;
the temperature reduction have contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic peninsula in the past 50 years have war@@ med around three degrees and t@@ amed to the areas where the temperature is the fastest .
CD@@ U wants to make ha@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the personnel
&quot; because it is becoming more and more difficult to occupy free @-@ throwing jobs , the CD@@ U is calling out of the employer association to become more attractive . &quot;
only shortly before the summer break the Krem@@ ist@@ ag has made 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the county administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 apprenti@@ ces now have their first working day behind them .
the teachers in the circle are apparently very popular .
around 6@@ 20 applications were to be noted for the places this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle is missing staff , in order to cope with the increasing requirements and tasks . &quot;
&quot; currently , in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann , there are still 50 not occupied places . &quot;
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U is now to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and U@@ W@@ G , and decides the shortage of skilled workers in the administration . &quot;
the administration is to develop a concept for human resources and personnel development according to the request of the parties . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term needs of skilled workers , but to counter@@ act future @-@ oriented of the applicants . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should also orient@@ ate inside and outside , provide concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and involve an educational background , call CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ W@@ G . &quot;
this already sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has it done with personal problems that you did not know before .
other cities promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech is given by a &quot; &quot; right &quot; &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
&quot; this includes a high number of employees , the disease or age ines from the service . &quot;
thus the highest time for action thus cannot remain un@@ occupied .
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , Leader of the CD@@ U , continues with his party beyond the joint application . &quot;
he has long been in the cre@@ ist@@ ag for a lazy &quot; surprise &quot; when he asked the recruitment public in question and aston@@ ished the rest of the parties .
peoples want to be checked that all possibilities will be reviewed from the municipal employer association .
&quot; if we are not at short notice to a satisfactory solution here , the county administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a bon@@ net asp@@ iring &quot; , &quot; so peoples . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the CD@@ U attempts to pay the employees and officials to better pay the public service for the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , elev@@ ations or more money there is only when one changes in a higher level which changes in professional years . &quot;
&quot; however , the work of the circle has grown more and more in recent years . &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up , in which employees are concerned about the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute law . &quot;
&quot; last but not least by the rising number of asylum seekers , the Board of Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin judge have a problem : they have too little personnel . &quot;
Italy intensi@@ fies the tone to the NGO @-@ migrants rescue @-@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has also warned that the li@@ f@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean are warned that they may not continue , unless they adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not submit a new Code of Conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work on , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , because their team had worked together effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a manner that facilitated the illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the aid organisation , which only has been in operation since a year , refused to express themselves at detailed allegations of the Italian pro@@ secutor of Am@@ bro@@ gio carto@@ sio . &quot;
&quot; for us , saving the human life remains our top priority . so we are sorry that we are not able to operate at the moment in the search and rescue zone , &quot; said the organization in an opinion on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can all accus@@ ations that are currently collected , until we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had monitored the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , which has been surve@@ yed since October . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that his occupation and boat migrants will take on board which can be delivered directly from human traffi@@ ckers , and that the smug@@ gler can be transported so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; such a coincidence , allegedly only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast took place , according to the acts of the pro@@ secutor , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
the occupation is suspected of the authority of the Italian coastal guard to de@@ duce the life@@ times in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta have to have a Italian police officers on board that monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to keep up the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules were considered unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring any &quot; &quot; essential changes or disability &quot; &quot; of their b@@ ail@@ out actions . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates Organisation doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; Minn@@ iti now said that the number of migrants arrived in Italy after the rescue measures in Italy , over the last few weeks , the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with the local civil master fruits have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; over the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with Tsch@@ ad , Niger , and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region , for four days long and sightseeing . &quot;
there were three liberated guides available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led to hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ chapel above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; there were view@@ points , partly on tur@@ rets , from which one could look far beyond the Pf@@ alz forest and the imagined planes . &quot;
in between there were always longer periods of asc@@ ents for the long tri@@ als .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the Pop@@ ular Wur@@ ttem@@ berg market .
&quot; again , viewpoint at the viewpoint , connected by &quot; flo@@ or@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
over the last two days many al@@ timeter were cancelled .
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and rever@@ ts brought welcome breaks . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim at@@ me@@ ars the bi@@ ker in the open @-@ air @-@ based br@@ ine br@@ ine .
also Neu@@ stadt was controlled .
&quot; after 17@@ 3 km and almost 4@@ 500 meters , the group had the Pf@@ alz Forest from its best side - sporty and culturally . &quot;
console instead of lawn - Bundesliga fit for e @-@ sport
&quot; sitting the sport stars in future before computer consoles , instead of fighting for wind and weather over the stadium ? &quot;
&quot; fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious branch , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - great stars , millions fans and huge tournaments with high gar@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; these have also recognized the first federal states , which are increasingly being involved in this field . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of 2015 , the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , founded in the middle of July an E @-@ Sport Department and took two professionals for the computer game of FIFA 17 under contract . &quot;
&quot; we hope to am@@ a@@ ze new young audiences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Board of Jo@@ chen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; it is certain that on this turn , he still rise to several associations . &quot;
&quot; at the next weekend , the Football World Association awarded FIFA in London for the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ er of various clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven qualified for example . &quot;
also Robin D@@ utt looks great potential in the E @-@ Sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen have now advis@@ es a agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real football must deal with the 14 to 30 years of age , that young people still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs were trying to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian . &quot;
&quot; with celebr@@ ity E @-@ sports@@ men , among the contract , one could be more often present on these markets more often than once a year to send the Federal Republic to Asia . &quot;
what is it exactly ?
&quot; the E @-@ Sport will play computer games like &quot; League Of Le@@ gends , &quot; &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just the soccer simulation of FIFA on competition level . &quot;
&quot; long ago , as in normal sports as well , Li@@ gen is established , in which the pros compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and with Asian games , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it all about a real sport ?
for many things the idea is safe .
also In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bed has had a long deal with the question .
&quot; for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because he is a competitive and many biological and physical responses , which you can also find in classical sports - for example , increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormonal changes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , we need cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction capability . &quot;
professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; F@@ rob@@ ous , but also regards problems : &quot; D@@ oping is becoming more and more an issue . &quot;

the scientist confirms the high inclusive effect of the E @-@ Sports .
&quot; players are internationally on the move , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural experiences . &quot;
a study of corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the E @-@ Sport a rapid growth ahead .
&quot; in order to be implemented in Germany 50 million euros in 2016 , mainly on advertising , sponsorship and big tournaments . &quot;
sales are expected to grow at 130 million in three years .
&quot; against the nearly 2,@@ 4 billion euros in the soccer league , this is little . &quot;
&quot; however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is not far away from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot;
international are many countries already further .

Michelle Carter because of the texts which Con@@ rad Roy push for suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encourages her friend through texts and calls to suicide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their conviction behind G@@ it@@ ters and five years were exposed to currency . &quot;
&quot; Carter was condemned in June due to the neg@@ ligent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ clou@@ dy . &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until calling .
&quot; it had been confronted with a maximum of 20 years , but their legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a psych@@ ic disease . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red pants and a cream colored bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down @-@ looking eyes , when she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions taken to Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; said the prosecution . &quot;
she ended his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility taken , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it has not shown any re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; terrible circumstance , which they fully regret . &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said however , he did not find that her &quot; age or maturity or even their spiritual disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a pro@@ secutor was reading a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is no day at which I will not pray the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I am proud that he is proud of me and as I go with everything . I try , despite all my pain we will carry for eternity with us , for his sisters being there , &quot; it says therein . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys S@@ ister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that they will never be pursued by the &quot; &quot; knowing &quot; &quot; that they will never be part of the wedding of their brother or would be a aun@@ t for his children . &quot;
&quot; no more that single person have been together with whom I had been together every day since my birth , is a pain that I will keep in myself for the rest of my life . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to put a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to commit a different suicide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy has found dead from a coal @-@ oxid@@ ation in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case attracted national attention , after Car@@ ter text releases were revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hanging on , spring from a building , erst@@ e@@ ech yourself , I do not know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she was sent to his family in the two weeks before his death . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told that Carter &apos;s attention was searched by the death of Roy and arranged that she would profit from the case by any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; among the few who defended Carter , Amanda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 due to murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times article : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the new mini @-@ Lah@@ m of the FC Bayern
that Joshua was allowed to run at the Audi Cup as a captain is no coincidence .
FC Bayern does the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner for a big season - Extra motivation fails to do .
&quot; anything else was there on his place in the cabin , that looked Joshua for me immediately , even if the additional clothing piece was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups of course no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er was to be seen , he made himself accessible to his arm . &quot;
&quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner after his first use as Bavaria @-@ captain . &quot;
&quot; good , the one could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the sign of coach could also pointed out that way .
&quot; not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen for youth play@@ mates , deb@@ as@@ ants and just out of vacation , professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a player leader , but he was . &quot;
&quot; su@@ gars are distributed most of the most lovely ones to those who want to be a lot of them , which one wants to keep in mood . &quot;
&quot; who was chosen to do the heritage of lam@@ m , a small extra motivation can only have good use . &quot;
&quot; Kim@@ ber@@ confirmed : &quot; &quot; this is what you want to play as a player : responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as a mini @-@ L@@ ame over the field .
&quot; right behind , this is now his position , the white ho@@ de on the arm did its rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , Kim@@ ck at this start @-@ up was like the one who can take the rod at the best of the hand . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to direct the in@@ scri@@ b@@ ted tro@@ upe . &quot;
&quot; he had the view of the whole , while many others were busy with themselves . &quot;
V@@ idal thus to over@@ play his missing fitness ( fol@@ te hardly ) ; Renato San@@ ches to tie on the services kom@@ m out to the services of Asia &apos;s journey ( fol@@ ly only partly ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le to fall at her first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t .
this was all pretty good .
&quot; Sü@@ le ran beside Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy before the ri@@ f@@ le , both agi@@ a sovereig@@ n@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ occupied Nap@@ oli storm often did heavily , in addition , sw@@ le tried to be successful in the game structure a few times . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy said that the result &quot; &quot; was not as we hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also he showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; shift , tem@@ po@@ d : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; as un@@ inhabited this Bavaria @-@ world , even for the new accessible , one saw in the connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ dy for example gave in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , not one or two , but determines six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ ba died after a few cris@@ p statements on his new co @-@ player .
&quot; there he heard a very interesting sentence from Sü@@ le , &quot; &quot; what goes here , I already noticed . &quot;
in Bavaria you just have to win any game . &quot;
after all this does not have to teach the new one .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pf@@ alz Minister : economy lo@@ ops Know pace
&quot; it is often an irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) , was still a business minister@@ ial of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate . &quot;
&quot; this is evident after more than one year , in which the new business ministers Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V @-@ request from a change in economic policy - and simultaneously the old Minister .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ er Companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; Wis@@ dom ass@@ esses the wishes of the economy , which has blocked Lem@@ ke all . &quot;
the largest in @-@ face provides Nat@@ us in infra@@ structural politics : the link of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is at the top of the country &apos;s primary list .
&quot; this year , the ministry hopes for a planning process , until 2021 the construction should be right . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um@@ h@@ ung Tri@@ er , which stands in the urgent need for the federal schedule . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to take the track in operation in December 2020 , says Minister of Cab@@ inet in Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ us sees in this a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competing companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Tri@@ er strives , as stimulated by Wis@@ sing , at the wine a Rhein@@ land @-@ Pf@@ alz label to increase the sales volumes in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German Wine exports for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ dom have an open ear for people who want to start a private company , pra@@ ises the Chamber of Commerce . &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce Tri@@ er sees in the new master @-@ bonus an additional incentive for young trainees , says CEO Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; planned is a bonus of 1000 Euros for the constitu@@ tive master inspection and 2500 euros , if graduates are self @-@ confident within ten years after the training . &quot;
but home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; in the planned road building are fast facts to create , at the same time out there the country on the necessary staff , says Jan Bell auer , main business leaders of the Chamber of Commerce . &quot;
&quot; 56 new engineers that wants to adjust Wis@@ dom at the state of mobility , are so far only 29 places are occupied . &quot;
the Chamber of Industry calls for more jobs to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; CD@@ U group vice @-@ Christian Bal@@ d@@ on refers to calculations of the accounting station , the country investment in 2017 and by 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of country roads . &quot;
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
ern@@ ails would also be the previous broad@@ band structure in the country .
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had measured the power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with the note of 3.4 . &quot;
they are figur@@ ing over de@@ cker internet connections and break@@ downs .
ex @-@ business minister@@ in E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the wind @-@ powered company Pro Wind .
&quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ ke on April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where they had already sp@@ inn@@ ed the field after four months due to dis@@ agreements . &quot;
&quot; Audi is to change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - Aut@@ oh@@ er@@ ers are confronted with a counter @-@ reaction . &quot;
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW @-@ Chair said , the company is the opinion that &quot; there are intelligent options as a tra@@ des@@ ks , &quot; and related to European cities - including Munich where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to ban or limit . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as re@@ vocation .
European automobile manufacturers have greatly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance rules for carbon emissions .
&quot; but the nit@@ rogen oxi@@ des that e@@ mit diesel engines are considered car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic , and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of the automobile manufacturers , systems for the neutr@@ alisation of diesel trucks exp@@ elled p@@ g@@ ase intake , also take too what it makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful car firms and ignore signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the error of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut@@ down devices that could regulate emissions when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were charged by Volkswagen , others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
last month the former director of the ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics in Germany was arrested in Germany .
&quot; the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is not protected from delivery and could be brought to justice in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Audi was included in German criminal investigation into Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi to have a system installed to handle the emissions regulations in Europe and a request that was focused on the United States . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation might strain Volkswagen heavy : the luxury car manufacturer contributes to the profit of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es and the laughter against suffering
&quot; Mor@@ dill@@ o was temporarily one of the most published cartoon carto@@ on@@ ists , the no@@ ises of his figures are hall@@ marks . &quot;
also with 85 the Argent@@ ine works and works on a film .
his message : lau@@ ghing as there is too much suffering in the world .
Guillaume &apos;s Mor@@ dill@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first few years as an artist , he was talking among other things as a poin@@ ter for Happy cards - which he was frustr@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; after stations in Lima , New York and Paris , at the end of the six@@ ties , he managed to break the breakthrough : with the publication of his Carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ dill@@ o found many fans .
again and again the artist is inspired by cities .
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ dill@@ o @-@ figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the sliding Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning he is still sitting on the drawing table today , works on a daily basis almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; over cal@@ en@@ dar@@ s , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ shirts , Pl@@ ush animals and watches you will find its dro@@ l@@ ful figures continue to spread much spread worldwide . &quot;
he has been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series with his characters .
&quot; the main person in the movie &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los any pet in his drawings , which has a thou@@ sand@@ al @-@ s@@ s@@ ler as a counterpart . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which is to come to the movie screen . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it is strange to me , &quot; says Mor@@ dill@@ o . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; therefore it is rather put on the TV series , which , as its original desig@@ nations , is produced . &quot;
lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
&quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the lavender is rec@@ alled because of the lack of drought and due to illness @-@ borne insects , which researchers and farmers trying to find solutions to find big head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the Agricultural P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because the plant in recent years has been exposed to the effects of climate change which in spring has brought much less rain and in autumn much more . &quot;
this has an impact on the life of lavender .
&quot; there is also a small ornam@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the d@@ warf @-@ ca@@ des and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is a lot on the game .
&quot; lavender oil is not only for holiday@@ makers , it is also very popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ m said : &quot; instead of having a very long plant drilling with a large number of flowers , we have under@@ developed smaller , under@@ developed and either weak@@ ened or weak@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; so , we have less parts with etheric oil . &quot;
&quot; among the solutions that are considered to be considered a better water distribution and the slo@@ wing of the ev@@ ap@@ oration of the ground , but also the sign@@ alling of plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties which are resistant to drought resistant to drought . &quot;

the assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce usually meet in order to review their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime ; corrupt officials and ce@@ as@@ eless drug wars .
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security . &quot;
it has been told to them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists will discuss what feels safer , they should take their children to the office , which were the target of an attack with shells , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; safety experts have written three words to a table at the front of the room : opponents , Neutr@@ al , allies . &quot;
&quot; please ask the re@@ porters , names for each column - no proof is needed , perceptions , and abdom@@ inal . &quot;
&quot; there are Drug Administration , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are being suspi@@ cious of standing on the salary list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no rest of the violence , and while in the whole country the cor@@ p@@ ses are frequent , more and more journalists are at least 25 , since President Enri@@ que Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to took place in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 stand for attacks and threats under Federal Protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven countries . &quot;
&quot; among the latter , her editors and their inspiration from Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest flaw is to live in Mexico and to be journalist , Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; its lack is felt deep , although its presence is present everywhere - a great picture of val@@ dez , which showed his mid@@ finger with the word &quot; Justice . &quot; two re@@ porters in the thirteen years , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , carry T @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared topics , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although in 2010 a Son@@ e @-@ Bundes@@ secutor &apos;s Office was built to process the cases of journalists , according to the committee to protect journalists only two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of kill@@ ings that are linked with drug trafficking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to justice . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are un@@ broken and although the terrain is now even more tra@@ itors . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting on the discussion of security has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very silly to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know the Why , we distr@@ ust all . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15th , Val@@ dez left the Bureau of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he managed to drive just a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and was shot 12 times presumably because of the name of the newspaper - the &quot; T@@ wel@@ ve river &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to wander freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an freely .
but on the theme Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans arrest in the past year and delivery in the United States in January , Sin@@ k@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , since rival@@ ing fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it does not make that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or more people will be shot at the street or that the cemetery is full of exp@@ ired , two @-@ story mouse ole@@ en for drug reg@@ isters , which are bigger than many houses for the living . &quot;
&quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace , &quot; if only a cart@@ el control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States . &quot;
&quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February the publication of a interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival@@ ing cart@@ els in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have been anno@@ yed by the sons , suspected gang@@ members bought every copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was not to force val@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper that had released the same story to leave the country on its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez has been a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing will be seen as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues were em@@ ulate that he would always be there .
&quot; he was active as a senior re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined forces with five colleagues to the foundation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , it was impossible to operate journalism without having to encounter the rob@@ atic problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; over time , the newspaper earned a reputation because of the courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising took place . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porter loved it , hard apt investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the founding of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for their coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in pursuing the mex@@ ican drug history , wherever they lead . &quot;
he volunte@@ ered that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug trading in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot;
they have to take over the task which falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what did you do with so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ?
&quot; the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the spa@@ wning bird , who was like a harbour worker , the friend who knew generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
you trust his routine .
he would always bear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ as , the bar opposite the office , go and always sit at the same table . &quot;
&quot; well , ask : was his love for the routine of his destruction ? &quot;
&quot; his death has also forced them to question their own assumptions on how they work best , and they can stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they do not like it if you are dealing with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home @-@ home and landing cars &quot; to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ keeping . &quot;
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
&quot; if it smells wrong , keep away from it . &quot;
&quot; the trouble is , the editors of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; smell a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing with Javier has happened . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer in Sin@@ k@@ alo@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a poison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative smug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials . &quot;
the landscape is constantly changing .
&quot; in the room where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for security training , suddenly no cell@@ phones were allowed . days before has been announced that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; out there were two poli@@ c@@ emen protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the State Government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ story building of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ porter asked whether these officers belong to the 50 per cent of the police officers , who described the governor themselves as a trustworthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the re@@ porters have gone into the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are under control . &quot;
for the edition of this week Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has blown on three main stories .
there was the assassination of the brother of the former known box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an Ex@@ pos@@ é to the State expendi@@ tures that focused on the hometown of the governor .
&quot; and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the Pro@@ secutor . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so it was advisable to write what everybody knows in the city : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ porter took from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy leader who ruled the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) , which ruled almost the whole century all political levels . &quot;
recently several Pr@@ i governors have been accused of corruption due to high @-@ quality cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this e@@ at@@ ery , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went a military attack . &quot;
only a few months before the readers had seen the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about the ab@@ duction .
&quot; we had previously wondered what is happening , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its slim body stat@@ ute . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez has been dedicated to storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers , who are prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because employees have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
re@@ porters Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez sn@@ apped a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning to a demonstration for a further journalist to the office of the pro@@ secutor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days , after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is of his .
journalists all over the country journalists become sil@@ ently stronger by re@@ written in organised protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on sal@@ aries and buildings .
&quot; on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to raise journalists and bring it into it , because they have said the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has since then asked that she is divided again by the government , because it is concerned that their anger has been violated . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico by organised crime , participated in government officials and an equal society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journalism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces working with organized crime under a blan@@ ket . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , the media @-@ W@@ äch@@ ter@@ group &quot; Ar@@ u@@ o 19 &quot; was assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you face , because they want you to keep the mouth dis@@ proportionate , &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot;
obviously the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the Northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; your body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by the Z@@ etas @-@ Kart@@ ell , &quot; Here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer can@@ did@@ acy and ear@@ phones appear next to their separated head .
&quot; some branches have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the Northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua according to the assassination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March . &quot;
&quot; others continue , as El Man@@ ana von Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo , following the assassination of its director in 2004 . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez publicly lifted the drug box with an editorial board on the front page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have escaped from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as apparently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay left and continue working , it is a daily dance with risky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once he wanted to be , gives to that the drug trade sc@@ aling him sc@@ ared . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat in front of the office and drank beer , when all of their phones began . &quot;
a number of s@@ wer@@ ies with band@@ on @-@ reefs and security forces near the bath@@ or@@ tes Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated further , as promised by a series of Kart@@ ell messages in the region . &quot;
&quot; from the on @-@ board stone , they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce about mobile phones . &quot;
the title page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ ens he@@ ats in the vicinity - a further shooting in the area .
&quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez cast a view of the poli@@ c@@ emen , the guards held to see if they were in readiness . &quot;
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they showed it not . &quot;
&quot; under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose center@@ finger was visible for quite sin@@ alo@@ a , the employees of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed its traces . &quot;
&quot; how can you also remember to close , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; if the same day , where Javier was murdered , the practic@@ ant asked me to send them to the road . &quot;
dinosau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age in order to so@@ ak its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , albeit a terri@@ fying . &quot;
&quot; now researchers have found that the first findings of the unbelievable rhin@@ ocer@@ os of a Canadian mountain@@ e@@ ers have been so well received , that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was so well received , that they could even find that its love of red@@ dish was brown - and they said they could have had something from a &quot; &quot; troubled past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology &quot; recorded it as &quot; the bes@@ po@@ ised dinosau@@ rs , which was ever found , and one of the best dinosau@@ rs in the world . &quot;
&quot; Fossi@@ l is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs , who lived in the middle of the Cre@@ t@@ ace@@ ous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot;
&quot; its incredibly well preserved state has researchers , which describe it as &quot; truly remarkable &quot; , &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant e@@ ater is the best preserved fossil fuel of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he was born on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something that was missing from the surrounding rocks , and decided to see more closely . &quot;
that was discovered by him Fossi@@ l was sent to the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years of covering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy soil . &quot;
&quot; after all of this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you just blin@@ king the eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept &quot; , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum , where the creature is visible . &quot;
&quot; it is considered to be one of the most beautiful and best @-@ preserved dinosau@@ rs specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa is the dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found that this plant e@@ ater , although it is covered with an arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably threatened by meat eating dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the strong ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age in order to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technology that is known as contrasts that are also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have been allowed to mix better in its surroundings and to so@@ ften its enemies , say experts , which suggests that it was threatened by major dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs was made for the first time in May and is now visible in the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ ch@@ elli after the museum techni@@ cian Mark Mitch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours with it to expose it carefully . &quot;
&quot; the amazing preservation of specimen was made possible , Dr. Mitch@@ ell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the shape of scales and arm@@ aments on his body . &quot;
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ counter , a widespread defensive method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the tip of the creature is darker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ proliferation is common , the results are surprisingly , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it points to the fact that the dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted from sufficient pressure by meat @-@ end dinosau@@ rs , that evolution fav@@ oring the confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use counter @-@ effects - think of deer , z@@ ebras or gir@@ d@@ ots - are much smaller and vulnerable as a prey , which sign@@ aled that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , strong ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs , how dangerous the dinosau@@ rs carni@@ vor@@ es have been to have been &quot; , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skins shows that the skin of the dinosau@@ rs rot@@ brown was .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal on information about his life , including his preserved performer to figure out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the dinosau@@ rs , when he died , pushed into a river and pushed into the sea , where he sank down on the back to the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time Alberta was as warm as in South @-@ flame today , and rivers and oceans probably are much more widespread than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs is really remarkable because it is completely covered with conditional skin , but also kept in three dimensions and retains the original form of the beast &quot; , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early chal@@ k period .
&quot; you do not need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just have a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is at bed@@ time . &quot;
&quot; the Cre@@ t@@ ace@@ ous time was a time , as enormous ther@@ opo@@ den , carni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ rs , who were standing on two legs . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta lived , the ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ v@@ n@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons he@@ wn monsters . &quot;
&quot; scientists , whose latest findings in the journal Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology appear , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta has fallen into the sea after the death in the sea and in mud m@@ um@@ i@@ fies . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he was born on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the bes@@ po@@ ised dinosau@@ rs in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely surrounded by the mu@@ zzle to the sleeve . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have wei@@ ghed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long tops made by his shoulders .
&quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant e@@ ater was s@@ war@@ med by the Western Canada , up to a flooded river it flooded into the open sea . &quot;
but the underwater ascent of the dinosau@@ rs kept his arm@@ or in an exquisite detail .
&quot; the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved , that the skin remains still b@@ umpy tank plates along the dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as rare as a profit in the lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it , the more conf@@ use it will . &quot;
pet@@ ri@@ fied resistance of the skin still cover the b@@ umpy tank plates that carry the skull of the animal .
&quot; his right for@@ ter is on his side , his five fingers are pointed up . &quot;
I can count the scales in his sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass kar@@ am@@ bol@@ ts at A@@ 8 : many injured
violent accident on Thursday night on the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous Ver@@ sions , kilometers @-@ long St@@ aus and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) were injured during a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age about 20 people .
&quot; after the first information provided by the police between 17@@ .00 and between 17@@ .00 , Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of Ai@@ ch@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storms just under 30 vehicles , including lor@@ ries , inter@@ tw@@ ined . &quot;
&quot; at first , there was no information on the exact number of the injured . &quot;
it is about light to moderate @-@ heavy injury - said a poli@@ ze@@ is@@ cher .
a large bo@@ b@@ ot on b@@ ail@@ out vehicles was at the accident point .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed towards Munich .
in the direction of Munich there was about ten kilometres long back @-@ back .
&quot; as a AZ re@@ porter reports , it also came on the recipro@@ cal way to massive disabilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the fire bri@@ g@@ ade revealed itself the hall@@ mark of the vehicle be@@ acons , which have now to be reck@@ oned with delicate punishment . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 pm there was a second accident at the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
it was a collision between an automobile vehicle and a passenger car .
a Res@@ cue @-@ Hel@@ icop@@ ter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : Group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everybody has experienced before : nothing bad sitting in the train and sleeps .
or one is plung@@ ed into his work and has just got a brilliant thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and ar@@ ouses an improper or irrit@@ ating the chassis in the middle of the work@@ flow .
postcard control .
but times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently the creator @-@ card control .
simply confirm by phone that you have taken up his place and de@@ values the ticket .
currently a test run on two tracks .
&quot; if the offer comes from , we extend it . &quot;
&quot; it will likely be available at the beginning of next year on many other remote routes in Germany , &quot; said a train @-@ speaker . &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; calls the railway off the track de@@ valuation without production .
&quot; in order to be able to use it , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to have booked an online ticket - whatever most passengers do already .
&quot; you also have to purchase it via the app &apos;s app , the DB navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking . &quot;
and finally you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works as follows : one clim@@ bs to the train , calling his ticket under &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with the test customer , a button for electronic de@@ valuation will be shown . &quot;
the train companion get on their mobile devices a message that chassis X is located on the train and took the booked seat Y .
comes the Zug@@ leader in the postcard control of Square Y he knows that there is a passenger sitting there with already ent@@ less online ticket .
&quot; so one can go on to sleep , continue to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the client , one for the train - which in turn use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; who wants to go back without a ticket control by our traction staff , chec@@ kt in the DB navig@@ ator just yourself . &quot;
&quot; this allows the passengers to make their travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Board of DB correspondence . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; those who often travel , knows that besides delays and most adapted trains , the ticket controls are among the greatest nu@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; for often , in any case one of the fellow travelers do not have all the documents that you need to de@@ valuation from online tickets . &quot;
either is missing the credit card or personnel notice or otherwise a document you have to prescri@@ be .
&quot; the consequence are endless discussions between the train companion and chassis , which leads to bad mood in the part or large @-@ room and delays in the control of their own tickets and to the Schaff@@ ner at the end time takes care of other matters . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and even on the links ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other train numbers on the same track are not yet available .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was shaken to her heart . &quot;
&quot; just one day after having arrived in New York City , the apartment was sitting in St. Louis , on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which they rented and scroll through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year child , and it is still on the road , &quot; says it there . &quot;
&quot; be@@ wil@@ ly since no one else had posted on their feed , she finished Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly saved on her tim@@ eline .
&quot; the r@@ apper from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year old , who was killed by a white poli@@ c@@ emen in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed , live . &quot;
he po@@ sted a picture of the Bro@@ wn@@ ess body that was stretched on the street and stay there four hours .
&quot; this is only wild , &quot; Fer@@ rell thought about himself . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she put her cell phone to return later in the evening to T@@ we@@ et over people on the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people who cried out , and by a man who said to be a shield with the in@@ scription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they watched a live @-@ feed in which a poli@@ cem@@ an was standing in front of a group of prot@@ esters with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , de@@ securities another poli@@ cem@@ an his ri@@ f@@ le and cried : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill you . &quot;
&quot; that is not usual , &quot; Fer@@ rell remembered her statement . &quot;
this is not the nature of murder that we have used to us and which we can be called .
in this moment I felt ch@@ asti@@ ly fro@@ st .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
you booked a flight back and went home the next day .
&quot; after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she fet@@ ched her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from the house of her father , and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; , &quot; in the cinemas from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which are of the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as a Fer@@ rel with her daughter who took a cau@@ dal go@@ wn and a suitable crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on drove the two a conversation that they had many times before this morning &quot; &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I have taught yourself when black people have to fight for that , what they believe in ? &quot; they remembered what she said . &quot;
we are going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on now because the police have killed over 18 @-@ year @-@ old boys and that was not right .
&quot; I could not take it , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
that which is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
they have to know it and see it and be re@@ ared .
&quot; it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organisation , but also know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even though I have the luck to give her an experience , in which she personally does not experience a bl@@ at@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I feel , I would turn her a bad service to keep them away . &quot;
&quot; the first stop when they arrived at F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp@@ ground as the activists waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined with a local business owner , who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared bags before and half to pass them on prot@@ esters .
slowly began to embrace a new type of activ@@ ism for pig@@ rell shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed after the 9th of August , she said and notices that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it is all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Fol@@ ay@@ an in the evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar just wanted to document , &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came into the meaning : &quot; &quot; do you document or try to find a story that you can exploit ? &quot;
&quot; this scep@@ ticism was nourished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites , in a community that benefited from their pain and strength . &quot;
&quot; as follows recently in an interview : &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , have not cent@@ red their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the former Co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field , who is known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ fts . &quot;
&quot; his commitment was bringing the project closer , together with six other indigenous people followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Bro@@ wns Er@@ furt . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking to us . we speak , &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , how these people will be represented , because so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ells &apos; experience - to show that the movement is not about a Messiah leader , but about a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the best participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ells life , as she loves and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and lau@@ ghed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that at this work and in the de@@ human@@ ization of black people a certain vulner@@ ability must give .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ells repeated history the role of the black gay women in the wider Black @-@ lives @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which have shaped the film &quot; &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; in social media since the killing of the black te@@ ens &quot; &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; in social media . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in executive positions have borne the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to remark that &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; it is however , however , that &quot; this is not a affir@@ mati@@ ver type of action , &quot; in which Fer@@ rell was chosen as the heart of the film due to their identity as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who testi@@ fied this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no coincidence , although it was at the forefront , because with a life on these crosses as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot;
you can feel your energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long ago disappeared , but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is on the currency for 2 ½ years due to the block@@ age of a highway at a demonstration .
it describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; a mess . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , she cl@@ oned off to a chant and she feels obliged to remember that she was three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on on the streets three years ago . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we have to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; sizes &quot; : TV readers discuss about bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves the people even though it is not yet built for a long time .
&quot; but the idea of a shopping centre on the southern part of the pedestrian prec@@ inct , divi@@ des the population in supporters and opponents since the first presentation 2009 . &quot;
&quot; cold , the subject is hardly possible . &quot;
also on our Facebook @-@ page &quot; referendum and Bit@@ burg &quot; the topic is discussed .
&quot; say one to the bit gallery : &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; does not need a man &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi Bet@@ zen ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; size bet ! &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while the advocates is building that a gallery attract more customers to the city , of which the remaining shops benefit , fear that then the pedestrian prec@@ edes . &quot;
&quot; added : the gallery is planned exactly on the property , on which the peasant hall stands , in which 13 direct market their products can offer . &quot;
with the beginning of construction work will be the conclusion .
&quot; the gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and indeed , to the Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility of sitting outside . &quot;
Simone Room : &quot; we &apos;ve been buying almost weekly in the peasant hall for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm are always happy to enjoy . &quot;
also the but@@ cher was discovered for us too .
&quot; we would like to hope that during and above all , after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer . &quot;
in other cities there is also .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; &quot; if direct marketed in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the amount of rent . &quot;
&quot; however , the new project is likely to be low . &quot;
Eva Kili@@ c : &quot; why purchasing Palace in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ or or supermarkets : I find that superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there are already enough in our city .
you see how many cargo stores here are empty - some have been for months and years .
&quot; but here there is not even a decent weekly market , it is all the more important that at least preserved the market hall . &quot;
&quot; after all , the commodity is fresh , is mostly offered directly from the producer and is mostly reasonably priced . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , cargo stores are located in a shopping center only by larger companies , because the dor@@ man@@ t rents are often not viable for a retailer . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special shops are almost no longer and what is left of it , will probably still disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a mall with a Mark@@ thalle does not fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where is the farmers market hall during construction time ?
&quot; the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - also on the duration , if the bit gallery will actually come . &quot;
or does it already create the gh@@ ost bit gallery before , to sell all the shops of Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this is simply not going to work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which stands empty , no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real peasant market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a peasant hall , yes , thanks to the w@@ ahn@@ sin@@ ful many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg is no place anymore . &quot;
&quot; when the peasant hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a suitable similarity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces can be seen - white , black and brown that are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - that hang on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from Wan@@ gen @-@ T@@ up@@ stream and hair segments which were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excerpts from the Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth where the former secret service analy@@ st sent a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after she publicly made as secret annex@@ ed diplomatic announcements on the website Wiki@@ Le@@ aks publicly .
&quot; the new exhibition , opened on 2 August , is called A Be@@ coming resem@@ blan@@ ce ( A suitable similarity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was unified in technology , computer sciences and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ wife and groundbreaking disco whose condemnation of Barack Obama was converted , when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been extracted by the algorithms analysis of DNA that could be extracted from Mann@@ ing and out of the 30 portraits - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ants of these interpre@@ tations - but also for identity .
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but already since her pu@@ ber@@ ty spoken openly about the identification as a woman , was sentenced in 2013 due to 20 accus@@ ations including six bre@@ aches of the mirror law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; through the prison , her picture was sup@@ pressed , so much that there was only a single photo - a gran@@ ular , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing is obviously uncomfortable on a driver &apos;s seat and a plat@@ former Persian has been associated with which it was associated . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of its 2012 project &quot; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
&quot; in this , the artist portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ ical ar@@ te@@ facts such as cigarette mu@@ zzle and che@@ wing g@@ um by creating the DNA from waste to create a picture of how these people might look . &quot;
that was the time when they received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press show of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were exchanged at un@@ equal brie@@ fing that were exchanged for several years in the course of two years .
&quot; they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated com@@ ic &quot; suppor@@ ter &quot; , &quot; which fores@@ ee a future in which the president would transform the Chel@@ ation verdict and it would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama is actually only a few days after the book was released , men &apos;s liberation after seven brutal years would demand in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome type of happ@@ enings . &quot;
&quot; there is also now at the opening of the exhibition a little low@@ ly and tri@@ ark@@ es , since Donald Tr@@ ump will lead a war against in@@ forman@@ ts dating back to government camps and against trans@@ gress troops to find new , twe@@ et spl@@ its , which he actually should fix it further . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen from a particular reason . &quot;
&quot; in one on the wall of the gallery written down @-@ written artistic statement , Mann@@ ing with her over@@ sized description below ( the &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; in its surname is equipped with a heart ) an end of the &quot; automatic de@@ frag@@ mentation whose basic sex , race , sexuality and culture have been . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence is written - a thou@@ sand@@ feet of Cs and Gs and As , written in pen@@ cil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped , by involving the 200 characters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ de after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological respects , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully bring , is that our genome is not taking care of who we are and how open genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , also to be seen . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so they are 30 of these stories . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is one page from the above Com@@ ic @-@ No@@ vel@@ le . &quot;
she shows Mann@@ ing as she appears with a release @-@ clo@@ ister in the hand from the discipl@@ in@@ ain of the United States as King @-@ Kong .
&quot; if they put your speech , they have won , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came right from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who greeted out of Philadelphia . &quot;
&quot; I still get ge@@ ese , when I speak about it . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was fores@@ een in the com@@ ic book - but if they should do it , it will be welcomed in the center of the room by the masks , from their own genom@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ement , which collap@@ sed as hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also focused on how everything was written in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , in which their genetic H@@ ap@@ log@@ ins have been written with pen@@ cil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , such as the movement , which is also behind their liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and a cler@@ k of the University of Oxford because of the killing .
&quot; a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who were looking for a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injury . &quot;
on Monday we were issued for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warrant because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau such as the stor@@ eys of the Cook County .
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau , 26 , after several stit@@ ches died . &quot;
&quot; one by the police authority of Chicago , published warnings , states that the body was discovered on 27 July . &quot;
&quot; officials received a call , came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau became still declared the place of what is dead , and det@@ ective investigate the stit@@ che as murder , while the police actively seeks after the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
La@@ achi has been an extraordinary professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice President for University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ dies has now been held in assessed and excluded from entering the campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal case investig@@ ates by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University co@@ operates at this examination , &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokes@@ person at the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in Britain in contact and are willing to help the U.S. investigation authorities in any way .
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were shocked and want it to be .
&quot; Chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said , he strongly urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have a vision of their place of residence , and our efforts to loc@@ alize them , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building administration of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a pu@@ zz@@ ling tip , who had said that in apartment 10@@ 08 is something . &quot;
the police described the scene as a very cruel one .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , it is not clear whether the incident took place on 27 July . &quot;
safety cameras were confirmed by security cameras that La@@ dies and War@@ ren in the building were .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza released a statement to the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim , and explores a variety of motives , including a possible home country . &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the W@@ ada timetable in the near future &quot; - the Russian vice @-@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
&quot; the Russian chan@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said , it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( W@@ ada ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ AD@@ A ) . &quot;
&quot; in a specific stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap R@@ US@@ AD@@ A has the right to plan and test in cooperation with Ukrain ( UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ ada timetable was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the W@@ ada &apos;s roadmap to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for re@@ formation of R@@ US@@ AD@@ A and recently published on the organization &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause any occasion for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria listed in the list however noted that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities approved the reported results of by the W@@ ada approved investigation by the Canadian lawyer , Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren as well @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russian sports . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the affair , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; we perform the examination since our anti @-@ D@@ oping system has made a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no state programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ kos &apos;s words voted with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian market place R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; nobody has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
R@@ US@@ AD@@ A was excluded in November 2015 in the course of D@@ oping Sk@@ and@@ als from the W@@ ada of the carrying out of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
&quot; however , you have been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after visiting the chief council of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ ada @-@ General Manager Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ US@@ AD@@ A moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;
al@@ di only sold no eggs more
they shared the company groups .
&quot; there &apos;s a pure precaution , it could continue with no health draw@@ backs , it was mentioned in the message . &quot;
&quot; from now on , only eggs are to be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested negative on fixed anti @-@ le@@ d@@ ants . &quot;
Al@@ di wants to produce clarity and transparency among its customers .
start @-@ ups who will help your business not to become the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your staff at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the surveys did not work .
&quot; answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not mour@@ ning the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who operates the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce H@@ air Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
she has called people from outside to help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on the wa@@ xing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it allows companies to address employees , specific@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers allow to deal with C @-@ suite managers and to turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ Bit for the pursuit of their health , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software Analytics tools used by companies to measure employees . &quot;
&quot; Deli@@ ver said that she had a better view of what your employees think and feel at G@@ lin@@ t in the three years . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it provides a heat card of the company that shows which units have most complaints and which leaders have low approval results - so you can find out why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the head of the workplace culture , you do not have to be involved in the next U@@ ber , who has been involved in Sk@@ and@@ ale , since then a former employee has published a blog post where an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment describes , in which those who have spoken to have been punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility . &quot;
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the finance technical site Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ ters , the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ all in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; convertible has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently signed up as a client .
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , convertible company lets companies tailor made &quot; Pul@@ - &quot; surveys , collect sensitive responses in real time and view the heat @-@ cards of your problem areas . &quot;
&quot; it also offers an anonymous SMS hotline , with the employee can report a bad behavior . &quot;
&quot; and if the main business leaders are included , complaints directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has recorded the Reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , founder and CEO of Conver@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that his staff is poorly treated or in@@ eth@@ ically , it can be costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cott , workers @-@ flu@@ oride and law@@ suits , &quot; said Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , convertible to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; sooner if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company &apos;s headquarters to submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a intimi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said there was no good way to track the discomfort of employees . &quot;
&quot; now , since the company Conver@@ ters may use problems that were previously hidden by managers , who were sitting in offices in cities or States - like discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ sustainable practice - to be identified more quickly . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree point of view in the experience of employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who guides the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment , li@@ tigation . &quot;
&quot; companies began to take ethics , values and employees involvement in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron scandal , said Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; but it took until the &quot; social media &quot; came to their right &quot; , &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ ters provide your software as a service , and load the company with recur@@ rent fees for the use of their products . &quot;
&quot; it is a business model , and a chance that will have the approval of venture capital investors , which both have supported start @-@ ups . &quot;
&quot; Conver@@ ters received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ app@@ hire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , which has raised the entire capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; won $ 10 million in November by Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners , bringing its entire funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , given the net@@ worked nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees are expecting more than previously .
competitive markets like Silicon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only .
staff want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are glad to be in a company that heard their voices , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience with Link@@ ed@@ In , which are both convertible and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors reach Ren@@ di@@ ten if their portfolio companies are running well . companies are good if employees are committed and engaged .
&quot; if the analytics tools of third promise , commitment and deployment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find assistance . &quot;
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrator of a firm does not take action .
&quot; in fact , when a company asks your feedback after your feedback , it may have an expectation that change on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change does not come fast enough , or not at all , it can breed dis@@ appointments and employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be willing to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen itself too much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow the staff , &quot; &quot; Hab@@ t you really heard me ? &quot;
take care of it ?
and if you don &apos;t care about why should I ?
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed who has now scored monthly employees , was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ ret@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees it was possible to organise the speed of decision @-@ making and quality of communication , capable of organising several teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; on Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights on the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better bond of workers in a sector which is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , you will lose business . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the br@@ ines .
it goes on at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A footprint on one side of the new exercise fields of the team entertained at the campus .
some have moved their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training plant .
for a good part of the team these un@@ paid minutes represent a lunch break .
&quot; players who are written to the Sommer@@ kur@@ sen will return after the three @-@ hour exercise to their audi@@ ts , before coming back the next morning at 6 : 30 to the water@@ man Football Center . &quot;
&quot; that is for the guys the next three days a real tre@@ ad@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday to Tuesday was closed . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ days exercises to facilitate the burden of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three trainings should start the U@@ CL@@ A at 19 : 15 o &apos;clock in order to meet the players already packed schedules . &quot;
&quot; the compromise reached from the two days is more than a day , where the brood at the beginning of the camp moved almost one week after the last season and during the summer school , during the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood practical exercises . &quot;
&quot; they should hold 18 exercises in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the beginning of formal , preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he support the control modification of the N@@ CA@@ A support , even if they add to the busy routes of the player another point . &quot;
&quot; we place this enormous burden three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply put it through , they plac@@ ken further , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ CL@@ A will end their practices as soon as the camp is termin@@ ated , what was thrown by the clear sight@@ ings of his fields from an adjoining parking and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , which has already been ej@@ ected with pedest@@ als , which is already a protective network behind a door@@ posts , no easy task . &quot;
&quot; brood @-@ players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a sp@@ ake a that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then adapt it to an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the vide@@ ot@@ and of an exercise , it is a fairly good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
&quot; we will do the best , with what we have . &quot;
I am not too much worried about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensify facts review in the fight against counterf@@ eit news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counterf@@ eit@@ es to the fact @-@ audi@@ tor by third parties and show their findings under the original contribution , &quot; said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News . &quot;
&quot; the company said in an opinion on its website , that it is to start with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible counterf@@ eit@@ es and to send them to the fact @-@ audi@@ tor , which may display results from the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the major part points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , many of which believe they have also influenced the US presidential elections 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , whereas the French voters were over@@ flooded in May with false stories , and Germany will support a plan to be punished for social media networks , as they did not manage to eliminate h@@ water @-@ filled posters like before the elections in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate declaration in German , that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany will be launched a test of new facts . &quot;
&quot; in addition to finding out what stories of fact over@@ cast third parties are challenged , people want more context to make @-@ founded decisions about what to read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product man@@ ag@@ erin for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook continues to test his feature to the &quot; &quot; related Articles &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to his news Fe@@ ed to reduce false messages . &quot;
creating a Com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a slip hole for Margaret T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ 1980 and 1980 @-@ s .
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from its cozy seat in the Be@@ wl River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who is dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , emerging British artist - Isaac Len@@ kie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly . &quot;
&quot; I only re@@ acted on the thum@@ b @-@ pressure on the side of a letter , written by a double @-@ car in the 1700 @-@ 0s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thum@@ b @-@ print !
&quot; and letters always smell to smoke , for at that time they lit a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself would be . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so struck with old papers that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England ( &quot; To be honest : I found my welcome pit a little over &quot; ) it all too nice to be true .
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle to watch the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ o@@ sities of the castle as about the mon@@ ed hy@@ ena heads at the walls and the bottles having spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
&quot; he emigr@@ ated through the grounds and ruins of the old castle , and spoke to Land@@ scape , gar@@ den@@ ers , and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key , and began to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received full access only in 2006 when the last Er@@ am , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died . &quot;
&quot; when Rhodes met a decade later , the employees started to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which aristocr@@ ats said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English appearance , maps , those who possessed , &quot; You might think that land@@ conflicts would be boring , &quot; &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought the two families . &quot;
guys , let everything go down its course ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse on the wider base in the English story , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; who leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant movement of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a recording of a rebellion which rose to 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ fe of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rhodes . &quot;
&quot; the farmer &apos;s farm began in this area and I thought , an uprising was a good start . &quot;
perhaps the two are connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , who told the history of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rons , hidden the family of Dar@@ rell seven years during the British Reformation . &quot;
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; in which the smug@@ gler of Arthur Dar@@ rell is represented in the 18th century ( a discovery that was done only after years later than his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos; favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be ok to always make debts and spend money for things they could not afford .
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men solve their debt crises , while rich old women healed , I imagine it as a he@@ ap of well @-@ looking guys before , with a talent to advertise brass . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his use in the castle , Rhodes is looking for another unique scre@@ aming experience . &quot;
&quot; he has brought a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a Com@@ ic novel about E@@ sm@@ el@@ mä@@ ki behind him , the terrain of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been re@@ claimed from nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go again , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the dam@@ ned life . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ en@@ chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf envel@@ oped
&quot; with the v@@ eiling of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ en@@ chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef on Friday started its campaign to introduce a new roof brand ( Rundschau with Thursday ) . &quot;
even until Thursday Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team want to keep Nelson Ar@@ tz the logo and the slogan secret .
at the end of August there should be a festival at the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as a highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? , &quot; ask the creators of the promotion since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; they write on their yesterday un@@ folded website . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make clear that some is better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; in the action there is more than &quot; only &quot; one logo and a slogan , it is said . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate an all @-@ being promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able setting . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in the competition with other municipalities . &quot;
&quot; a middle five @-@ digit amount will be the town of Bad Honnef , its new roof brand and the campaign . &quot;
military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan &apos;s fear of the army
every year in early August advis@@ es in Ankara of the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) on pen@@ sion@@ ists and ou@@ ting in the officers .
so also this week .
at first glance a normal process .
&quot; but nothing is routine with the Turkish army , one year after the coup . &quot;
&quot; the meeting did not take place in the building of the General Staff , as formerly , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; the presidency of the Heads of State now took part in the five deputy re@@ mi@@ ers , as well as the Minister of Defense , Home Affairs , Justice and Ex@@ ternal Action . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the civilians in Y@@ as were in the number of people . &quot;
the government moves the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; the General Staff of Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , of the air forces and the nav@@ y were put off . &quot;
&quot; since the failed Cou@@ p , President Erdogan 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged links to the motion of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who sees Erdogan as a wire pull . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 persons who were directly involved in the coup , will be negotiated in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; on the day after the coup , Erdogan had described the overthrow of worship as a &quot; divine gift , &quot; as he give him the opportunity to fully puri@@ fy the armed forces . &quot;
but Erdogan the army really under control ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; hur@@ t@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ e@@ ye@@ gen in the military headquarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the Staff of Staff give it concerns because of an increasing &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; of the army , which manifest themselves among other things in the lifting of the head@@ tu@@ ch@@ ban for Sol@@ dat@@ esses , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
the Grand rein@@ forcement of the army and security guards goes on at any rate .
&quot; in the middle of July Erdogan ordered another 7@@ 3@@ 95 citizen mo@@ ist , among them 2@@ 30@@ 3 poli@@ c@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed that Erdogan t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als used earlier than the real lords of the country .
three times they were calling for their role as guardian of the worldly state order .
&quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erdogan lifted the power of the military step by step , not least calling for the reform of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdogan &apos;s driving specifically a Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; a particularly so @-@ called officers , who sought asylum after the coup , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; full of extremis@@ ts and sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; in a few years . &quot;
&quot; to do this , such a development could not be cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , there is no doubt in the Alliance after the cleansing of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational capacities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; said Nato diplomats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media . &quot;
&quot; he looks ahead of reducing the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules on vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions for family @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and reduce billions of dollars for tax@@ payers and will do this by the US will change the way the citizens from other countries of the Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; these new applicants will benefit the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media . &quot;
ministry wants to re@@ comp@@ ose track for racing and race
&quot; over the past few months over the future of the race was denied , it is now going to go very quickly . &quot;
&quot; even before the end of the year , at the m@@ aro@@ v distance , on which the tourist track drives , built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the race track in the long term , according to the traffic of the Federal Ministry , we should start working on the track in this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to order and re@@ comp@@ ose the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ ingen , the country knows itself to this especially important connection , &quot; stated traffic state Secretary of Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the cost of the maintenance of the circuit is about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country over@@ take 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the Treaty , on whose basis the shuttle will also be ordered in the future of the country , I am finally final matched , declared S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the ministry and the South @-@ Thur@@ in@@ gia as the operator already agree on the technical details already .
&quot; this is how the roadmap used , the vehicles used and the quality standards have been negotiated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for eleven years .
thus the race ste@@ er@@ g shuttle will be ordered in December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g Shuttle is one of the most popular railway connection between the stations of Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; in the past few months , during the course of a pilot business , the circuit has been used for many people to order it regular again in the future . &quot;
the track is also very strong in parts .
the rise of sex @-@ robots is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought it may not be crazy in 2017 , a new report comes about the technological developments in the field of sex robot . &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
sex @-@ robots are currently a big thing .
&quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robot@@ ics in the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , em@@ eri@@ ti@@ led professor for Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start to take their Ascension seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye colour of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of fingers . &quot;
&quot; people make themselves funny , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey on the release of his new report . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ bs have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners with a sili@@ cone skin which feels warm and with conscious human reactions to be achieved by the artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also adjust his robot according to his convic@@ tions &quot; &quot; and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the type of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or colour of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it is still disturbing , since many robots have the &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; that would allow a step@@ ford woman to be progressive . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ bs have developed to robots with a sili@@ cone skin .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example to adapt its users to the characteristics of their robots , which they are pleasing , such as relap@@ se . &quot;
and then there is the Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ robot with pre @-@ programmed figures such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of relap@@ sing and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; war@@ med the site of True companion . &quot;
&quot; so they like what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
it also has its m@@ oods over the course of the day - just like real people !
&quot; it can be tired of being fixed on conversation , or it can be &quot; in the mood &quot; ! &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects in this climb of sex @-@ robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the lower female properties , the attacks on rape , when one gets a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : reluc@@ tant ) Far@@ rah , &quot;
&quot; on his website , True La@@ y Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibration , why can men then not have Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex @-@ robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just a different sex @-@ toy . &quot;
&quot; their generation and their growing refinement indicate a little darker and deeper understanding in our culture , to retreat from the ideal gender equality to a desire for sex with sub@@ ju@@ gation as an optional addition . &quot;
&quot; most men will of course keep no sex robot , and while the FR@@ R noticed their growing popularity , they still remain on the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what perme@@ ates from the boundary zones , can be very instruc@@ tive in relation to the spirit of the times in which we live , very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
many people are not strange or insul@@ ating until they give them the free market for this .
&quot; there is yet certain over@@ l@@ apping that these highly developed sex robot occurs in a period in which the rights of women are threatened in the world , in which there is a president in the White House who has dressed women sexually . &quot;
the most aw@@ ful aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images that affect the distorted body and the extinct eyes but how realistic this vision works .
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star @-@ proportions ) .
their builders want it to be human feeling that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to its &quot; personalities , &quot; robots do not represent real women . &quot;
you cannot separate from their companion or simply walk away .
&quot; they have no mediation or background history , nothing , which refers to independence or anything related to the imagination of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are counterf@@ eit slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the speech of 2017 : maid
Tr@@ umps of great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney as the term of a healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a B@@ ump era era that the political divisions , which pol@@ arized the U.S. constitu@@ encies , have also split up families in the small @-@ format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and harvest feast there was in the USA newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump selected relatives . &quot;
we are all alleged to put in all of us to make our filter bub@@ bles .
&quot; notice has been noticed the power of Tr@@ umps , families to bring together . &quot;
&quot; I chose this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ oriented poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been dealing with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , who has visited me this week in New York . &quot;
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy may have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everybody knows whom she knows , including the Republi@@ can kin@@ ship , having fought for decades due to the politics , suddenly and quite especi@@ al on the same side . &quot;
&quot; to the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls me in a further context that this also brings considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the suspen@@ ding effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ asp@@ ed possibility that we will no longer cope with that one day . &quot;
&quot; however , there is still a sha@@ ky long @-@ time scenario , norm@@ alized in the rec@@ umbent re@@ public@@ ans of the right @-@ wing &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; once in comparison to his standards suddenly as an in@@ term of denial . &quot;
&quot; I think today of an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ gical version of the mad@@ man , the dog on the Aut@@ od@@ ach , which looked 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how its tax statement looked ) - both in comparison to trace in fact one as very mild criminal off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of Re@@ public@@ ans must only be spiritually healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ measurable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousin in the city was , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the biggest of the Kar@@ uss@@ ell of the New York &apos;s parking department , and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city if you do not require any caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all clo@@ wns are scarce and the animals are revol@@ ve in order to look full of fear about their own shoulders - very dark and climatic music conve@@ ys this in a peculiar fashion . &quot;
&quot; so many monasteries to dis@@ appoint a city : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty years later , and I am still not all over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not one - but a big roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a weird magical experience , as here two two year old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women who can go to it in the 40 @-@ years and have all a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have seen the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked them afterwards . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; &quot; experience &quot; &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I moved my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my road it is the same , plus the option to eliminate the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this leads not only to a slo@@ wing of what is supposed to be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor wife in the department store was exc@@ usable , while I got tired of experience , having my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with breast @-@ pain from prison to hospital
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot;
&quot; last year he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of snoring in the hospital , which he suffered the prison authorities after a case in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was condemned because of the pro@@ secut@@ ors of the pro@@ secut@@ ors for a first ro@@ aming part due to the murder of the pro@@ secut@@ ors .
&quot; he k@@ ills Ste@@ en@@ kam@@ p in the early morning of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 , by passing them several times through a door of the toilet , in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria , on them . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us asser@@ ted that he held his girlfriend for a ni@@ ghtly intru@@ der that was hidden in the c@@ ab .
pro@@ secut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year imprisonment of Pist@@ ori@@ us appeal from which they say it was too indul@@ gent .
&quot; the national law enforcement authority said that she will rise in the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year . &quot;
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us runs risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years , if the pro@@ secut@@ ors are successful . &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer to find a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ äss@@ äss@@ ler from F@@ ors and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and the continued schools . &quot;
&quot; in future , three of the students go to the grammar school , four to the real school . &quot;
Schul@@ tz Angel@@ ica Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the civil house Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen on Tuesday evening .
&quot; as a symbol of school dis@@ mis@@ sal , the 29 students of the four classes under the leadership of Sophia Schu@@ macher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ des a young eagle who grows in the chicken , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the m@@ ote Sch@@ ar carried a musical with the title &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the Chi@@ n@@ erhof . &quot;
&quot; Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to bro@@ ods from his chicken . &quot;
instead of a hen @-@ kis@@ sing came a little eagle .
&quot; but the hope of making him a chicken , and the eagle wed down on a high mountain of his wings , and escaped . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinder bore to the w@@ ager . &quot;
the Eagle stands for the integration : she said Schul@@ ker Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te .
&quot; the young is different from the other young @-@ animals ( chi@@ cks ) , but belonging to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
she wished every four @-@ year @-@ gra@@ der that he feels in his new school .
&quot; it followed acceptance on the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who again and again jump at under@@ wear , and the parent &apos;s representatives . &quot;
the chi@@ ken@@ ess is now over , the teacher @-@ teacher Sophia Schu@@ macher . &quot;
&quot; she let her students take classes after two years of lessons , because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the neighborhoods . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students had a song of summer time and holiday season . &quot;
she broke great joy with the children .
for the new school year already eight of the first pre @-@ äss@@ äss@@ ler has already registered .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were de@@ tained for illegal camps in Greece , divided the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television , with . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of the 1st August , in Si@@ th@@ onia , the police have arrested a group of illegal killed people , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
on the same day they were released while there is currently an investigation .
the Foreign Ministry reported b@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians were later released .
&quot; the Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated the control of the free Camp@@ s and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , which is not intended for this purpose . &quot;
controls will be continued during the entire season .
the ministry was saying that the court is able to disp@@ ose of a sentence .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those who need to know now
how exactly is the software update taking place ?
must diesel @-@ drivers participate in action ?
the most important questions and answers in brief .
&quot; the Diesel summit offered BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group software updates for a total of around 5.@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
they are intended to improve the exhaust @-@ behavior of cars of the emissions classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are exempt from this .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from the ACE car Club Europe are assessments :
is the new action compulsory ?
no that are tra@@ ded software updates are voluntary .
&quot; the mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles , the che@@ ating software , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
the retro@@ fit has arranged the force office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced a strong implementation in the coming months , but not yet an exact date . &quot;
Daimler has communicated to write any person concerned .
&quot; if there is anyway an inspection , I will be done in their frame . &quot;
how long does the re@@ armament apply altogether ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
this rule depends on the engagement of the manufacturers as well as political pressure .
&quot; for we have seen , voluntary act on the subject of environment so far not . &quot;
how long shall the update last ?
retro@@ fitting itself might take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be it to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers make driving no car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE can wait for the wait .
&quot; probably , foreign manufacturers would like to follow , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
is now a massive prize of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
&quot; but , in the regions , where driving har@@ es are dro@@ w . &quot;
in rural areas there is so far no value losses for older diesel .
&quot; to mark the ACE , with a sale yet . &quot;
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center @-@ Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the glam@@ orous events in Washington .
&quot; the first prize @-@ giving of President Tr@@ ump promises to be politically . &quot;
one of the winners does not want to come - out of protest .
&quot; ll Cool J ( 49 ) is one of the sought @-@ after awards from the prestigious Kennedy Center . &quot;
&quot; in this year the singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) , as well as the chore@@ ograp@@ her Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV @-@ producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) . &quot;
the awards will be delivered at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , us President Donald Tr@@ ump will organize a reception and participate together with his wife Mel@@ ania at the awar@@ ding . &quot;
the awar@@ ding @-@ winning TV series Le@@ ar is already announced to with@@ hold the participation in the gala .
&quot; the &quot; New York Times &quot; said : &quot; &quot; this Presidency has decided to neglect the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them the means - and that was deb@@ ited me . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump in order to clear their point of view . &quot;
the Kennedy @-@ Center named after the former president John F. Kennedy @-@ Center is the largest cultural direction in the US capital .
&quot; among the earlier awards , Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we are making the city liv@@ able
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , continues in R@@ ent in the coming year . &quot;
the passage is already written - suitable applicants are rare .
for 31 years is W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work is still great fun as he taught in the press talk .
&quot; he reports of varied , but also challenging tasks that are waiting for his successor . &quot;
at the same time she wondered that so far no application does not provide the requirement profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the end time .
so - taking into account the regular dis@@ inf@@ estation - still enough time for a review .
&quot; as Has@@ l@@ ach also acts for the administrative community as a sub @-@ law authority , the applicant has to indicate appropriate degrees . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if the citizens could no longer fill it out , the citizens would have to drive for advice up to Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; however , the closeness between the city and its itself is important , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good company atmosphere , as well as a good mood between the authorities and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some major projects have accumulated , which looks back to the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city liv@@ able , &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building office and its employees . &quot;
but also in the future varied projects are on the agenda : the design of the former Hu@@ cl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and of the low @-@ parking lot around are imp@@ aired .
the Kin@@ zi@@ g@@ bridge between B@@ oll@@ en@@ bach and Stein@@ ach is renewed and the stadium is still on the subject .
&quot; the latter alone will strike around 1.5 million euros to be@@ ech , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker appreci@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; designed for a city @-@ master room , there is great scope . &quot;
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own building yard and gar@@ dener could be responded to much flexibility .
&quot; you can move much , &quot; W@@ acker , and the design of the green plants are often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; since the old city stands as an ensemble among monuments protection , be it important to have an eye on what is pure , &quot; when new buildings are approved , stresses the cre@@ tion Stadt@@ bau@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister bears high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is Bau@@ herr , &quot; &quot; at the end , everything is running here over my table . &quot;
with care and coordination he can count on many years of employees : Markus Neu@@ maier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing since ten years with Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ construction ) for 15 years .
&quot; also that his successor is long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay in place . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good company atmosphere , but also for the further development of the city . &quot;
&quot; who wants to be@@ g Roland W@@ acker , should have a completed studies after the city of Has@@ l@@ ach , as a diplom@@ at or bach@@ elor &apos;s degree in architecture , and have good expertise in the fields of construction and construction planning law . &quot;
&quot; the municipal office are high @-@ depth and deep @-@ building , construction planning , cru@@ el@@ ic@@ ity , management of municipal property , urban operating farms , with building yard and municipal law , including monument protection . &quot;
bicycle on lines cast on the south@@ ward track
&quot; according to police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ator had thrown the blue bike from the railway station in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines . &quot;
these were so heavily damaged that the her@@ edi@@ fying freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetrators and look for the night hours after them .
near the scene were witnesses of a ros@@ ar@@ oter Rol@@ ler@@ - and a bike driver has been observed .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ d meeting , &quot; said O@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to APA &quot;
the wron@@ g@@ do@@ ers would have brought themselves into great danger and also threaten the train traffic .
&quot; in addition to the damage at the Lo@@ k and the plant , as well as the delays and costs for the passenger transport , even the rest of the railway lines could also be sent to the perpetrators . &quot;
&quot; to go out of a &quot; significant &quot; sum , the speaker said . &quot;
&quot; the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south lane could be fought without disabled . &quot;
&quot; barely ten person@@ ages were Friday morning , two of them look for correspondence . &quot;
&quot; frei@@ gh@@ ings did not fall off , but they were delayed . &quot;
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced approximately 200 meters high @-@ lines .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; meat , dairy products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( inflammation of the disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare .
&quot; but a new study claimed precisely the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition , affecting around 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom 300@@ ,000 , causing stomach vap@@ ors and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while the person usually get advised to avoid meat and dairy products , researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contribute to develop immune cells that promote tolerant intestinal . &quot;
&quot; the leading researchers , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells in the gut pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food , do not penetrate into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells , which are able to resolve inflammation , are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissues . &quot;
&quot; when the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result from inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
in experiments was noted that a type of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell occurs on mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium into their initi@@ ates .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the components of proteins - to em@@ ulate the appearance of cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one at Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich diet tolerant , less inflammatory bo@@ wel , if the same system also wir@@ es on people . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ doc@@ torate in Dr. Luisa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan investig@@ ates a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study exercises such cells had , but another group of the same tribe , which was not separated . &quot;
&quot; they suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bial patho@@ gens had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi , which usually live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the mice of the mice , DNA sequ@@ en@@ cated and there were six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells , but without them lacking in mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were raised in a steri@@ le environment so that they were missing a intestinal micro@@ bial and did not develop these kinds of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; to understand how the bacteria out to the immune system , the researchers were growing down to the immune system , and then carried out small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells , which were isolated from the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the tolerant cells .
&quot; when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ met@@ allic ism that is known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 l@@ actic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food case of mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ ous values decreased , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ side products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i developed the cells in men as they were in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote , as these cells are inflamm@@ ations on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ values can lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
&quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; genius &quot; &quot;
&quot; at Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , &quot; &quot; believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid @-@ field player on Wednesday evening his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million Po@@ unds of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game , before the UEF@@ A super Cup starts on Tuesday , and impres@@ sing in the Hal@@ f &apos;s role as people like Paul Po@@ g@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira . &quot;
&quot; however , MAT@@ IC had been excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asian tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which was to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , that he had to improve in front of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him earlier than later ready .

&quot; three of four to get , thank you for the club , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happier if they get four out of four , but they have given great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US pilot manufacturer has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle in the US state Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
the shape of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers .
the whole thing was an endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already done such advertising .
&quot; thus , the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted into the sky . &quot;
&quot; new depression for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; just as the wind was about : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was an SPD boss , the S &amp; D vice @-@ president was always facing some concern to Berlin with a certain concern . &quot;
&quot; only no stor@@ ks from the party central , merely no opposition from the federal government - so was the most important desire of the election fighters . &quot;
&quot; from Martin Schulz , the party has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from the Willy Brandt @-@ House observe the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals . &quot;
&quot; what Mr Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not even be described in the approach . &quot;
there were depths .
and in one after the other .
the covenant CD@@ U sees after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and green .
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising fac@@ tional struggle of a Green Members has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a serious crisis .
&quot; five months before the Sunday elections , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green Party executive director Michael Kellner has called on the ab@@ omin@@ able Nieder@@ säch@@ sische Greens @-@ member El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to return their mandate .
the surplus to the CD@@ U is a clear denial of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ west must immediately return its mandate &quot; , &quot; said the Federal Minister and Ele@@ ction of the Greens to the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this may not be true at all , &quot; si@@ ghed an SPD electoral campaign , when on Friday afternoon the new hip message reaches the Party headquarters . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD @-@ President of Lower Saxony , stands under the Over@@ coming of the Green Members El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to CD@@ U without own government majority . &quot;
it is the provisional highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD country associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the unexpected defeat in the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , cal@@ med the comrades at the time . &quot;
&quot; after the agricultural elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and Nor@@ dr@@ h@@ ein @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia , everything will be different . &quot;
this then became clear - and it all was much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the Tau@@ ride , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite Haute the party again . &quot;
lab@@ orious the comrades met in the weeks afterwards .
&quot; then , when they had caught up new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him came the next deep @-@ down .
&quot; Mayor O@@ la@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD chief , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned . &quot;
and because he made so pretty much wrong in crisis communication about what you can do wrong .
since then Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival .
so now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; because of the VW exhaust and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Nieder@@ säch@@ sische Prime Minister has been in criticism for a longer time . &quot;
mi@@ xes were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or maybe this is why , Wei@@ l tried to get stronger in the last weeks ever stronger , in the Bund . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the former Yugosla@@ v of Hannover , his power in Berlin , remained un@@ hidden in the surroundings of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they allowed him to grant him as they spoke out by Wei@@ l a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could enter .
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l is meeting in the party internal co@@ er@@ ous Greens , basically no fault . &quot;
and Schulz certainly not at all .
&quot; one time , comrades try to keep their own ranks . &quot;
&quot; their wrath is focused on the Greens , and here above all to the da@@ wned parliament@@ ar@@ ist t@@ v@@ ests . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ arable and democratic , as wife T@@ v@@ ests puts her own careers over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , chief of the Party &apos;s left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Ms. T@@ ong@@ ated is not elected by her person as direct kan@@ gar@@ ine , but on the state list of the German @-@ Sax@@ on Greens , the Euro @-@ Sax@@ on member continued . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that they have returned their mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , leader of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compl@@ ained an &quot; non @-@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the elec@@ torate four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Wei@@ l to the Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Nieder@@ säch@@ sische SPD as a leading edge @-@ education in the federal election , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now , the personal career prohi@@ bit the future CD@@ U members in the election result , &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann said . &quot;
he asked to clear the background .
&quot; I want to know if there have been more or more to pass the commitments of the CD@@ U Lower Saxony . &quot;
support for Ort@@ k@@ ies III
anyone who wants to get started in the years can soon get support from the country .
&quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of St@@ eg Stadt@@ development on Wednesday in delicate . &quot;
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler gave a look back to what happened so far .
since 1991 there are in delicate re@@ development areas .
&quot; at that time , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the State of Baden @-@ Württemberg has not taken over two thirds of the funding . &quot;
the grant from 2005 to 2016 was at least 60 percent in the refurb@@ ishment area II from 2005 to 2016 .
&quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to also develop the interior design , and not just opening new building areas . &quot;
on 4 April we received the information from the Karlsruhe Board of Govern@@ ors that there will be a san@@ itation area III .
&quot; the total amount of 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which rose 500 000 Euros from the country , the rest from the community . &quot;
so how is a san@@ itation ?
&quot; you will continue to examine such fl@@ yo@@ del , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; however , it also play a role whether in the planned field all are concerned , too . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the regional borders could also be moved again . &quot;
&quot; the jet@@ ty appeared on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; cellar presented the contents of the federal government program &quot; Soci@@ ale Stadt , &quot; where the refurb@@ ishment would then be performed . &quot;
&quot; core of the program is the re@@ vit@@ alisation of inner cities , improving the residential and work conditions and the preservation and expansion of the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be object @-@ related , that is , per plot , carried out . &quot;
the re@@ development area would finally be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the eligi@@ bility period for funding runs since 1 January 2017 through 30 April 2015 to 30 April 20@@ 26 .
&quot; even until September this year , however , the inventory would be carried out at once , within the framework of those who want to fill out a questionnaire on the refurb@@ ishment area . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the proposition should be carried out as possible as the pun@@ ctu@@ ation date , so that in the coming year it is possible to start with the renov@@ ations . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann said that each Commune has to perform the said pre @-@ investigations .
&quot; it is about to evaluate and decide the urban failure , when it is re@@ written and to what extent . &quot;
for the particular property there is also a san@@ itation review in the basic book .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again once again and get a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
Got@@ zel emphasized that an essential success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
&quot; therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires to be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled up until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; building and plot &quot; &quot; in which it is related to the construc@@ tional condition and the restoration views . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; Hou@@ se@@ - and Hou@@ d@@ bow &quot; , &quot; data can be made to size , distribution and inhabitants of a living room . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; operating margin &quot; &quot; can only be used when in building business spaces are operated . &quot;
&quot; however , in mind , Got@@ zel is pointed out that a filling questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new building measures are not con@@ du@@ ci@@ able . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler stressed that the distribution of funding according to the &quot; wind farm &quot; &quot; - who first comes , ad@@ mon@@ ies first . &quot;
you could not reserve a subsi@@ dy for later &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; Ort@@ k@@ ies II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
British inventor uses a micro@@ chip to come up with a hand movement in house and car
&quot; a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip so that he can open his door , enter his office and even can start his car with a hand@@ shake . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and for@@ ef@@ inger and now offers the service to businesses and individuals who wish to simplify their lives with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has joined together with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ aes@@ the@@ tist in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to make sure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standard . &quot;
the technology resembles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of North@@ am also wants to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything available for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now built both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the tax . &quot;
the promotional cost of the White House would cost tax@@ payers thousands
&quot; the decision of the White House , a nav@@ y helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights the American production last month , the tax@@ payers have been left to the TIM@@ E magazine to the TIM@@ E magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky v@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , the heart of the event was held on 17 July at the White House with American construction programmes . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Chief Executive Officer of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter created in Connecticut , in addition to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ man car from Wisconsin and a for@@ k@@ lift from Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; the Military Office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in an frag@@ mentary order or F@@ RA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter on the South La@@ wn landed , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit , which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I only wanted to be aware that you are aware of it because it is such an ordinary event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superi@@ ors , the deputy naval commander . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 p.m. at 7 p.m. in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 pm , and so long stayed until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening . &quot;
&quot; the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the restriction of service hours a second team would require a second crew . &quot;
&quot; the original flight area was during the event at the helicopter , while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; from the records provided , it was not clear whether the second flight was required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act promised federal states to use public ownership for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt the destination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; said the deputy commander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave a impetus for the reform of the health sector reform that was underway at the Senate , and he tried the efforts to susp@@ ects the government &apos;s regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft that is known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ OP is unusual .
&quot; Tr@@ ump led an investigation in February to investigate the presidential plane in front of his first campaign appearances in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and its Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential aircraft through its predec@@ essors . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said vice @-@ president of the White House , Lin@@ d@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often lead training trips around Washington and the South La@@ wn in order to put down the U.S. president in the White House with precise cen@@ tim@@ etres .
&quot; as a Tr@@ ump in early July at the G20 Summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led to the White House 58 practice courses . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event was en@@ umer@@ ated for the month &apos;s training requirement for the month , said an official . &quot;
helicopter units flew in addition to 11 hours a day for &quot; non @-@ Presidential commis@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the White House said that tax@@ payers have won the burden for any of the other re@@ qu@@ is@@ ations , presented at the event . &quot;
&quot; said a spokes@@ man from Si@@ kor@@ sky said , the company was not involved to put the helicopter on the South La@@ wn . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget names for the Presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ des of the Ministry of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D @-@ Er@@ equipment for the v@@ H @-@ 3D however is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight . &quot;
record of unit more than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Cor@@ ps Air Facility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argued that the actual cost of running the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ payers are based on estimates based on estimates of the equipment , is most mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual means . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the restructuring measures for DO@@ D do not contain the personnel expenses but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract . &quot;
&quot; at this time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an spi@@ der , the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present this week things that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the federal state Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have been working tirel@@ ess .
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to emphasize that . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter , when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ wall . &quot;
in the White House Tr@@ y said to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and jo@@ king with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

for class and stability at Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V above all the imports from the far north .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to bets at the Davis Cup .

&quot; it is as always hard for us .
&quot; you also need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give max@@ jan@@ in .
&quot; at the moment , it is currently not creating the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active French@@ man at the moment , when the tournament in the Czech Li@@ bere@@ c Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) will arrive at his first use in this season . &quot;

how America can harm the O@@ MV
&quot; really happy was Donald Tr@@ ump , when he put his signature in the law on the law to conf@@ use the sanctions against Russia . &quot;
&quot; in his hands to en@@ acted the law , the Congress held a few &quot; &quot; constitutional provisions &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the response from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed against the US . &quot;

&quot; since then , Invest@@ ors from the domestic O@@ MV , which are co @-@ financed with other European companies the construction of the Russian Ost@@ ro@@ ment North Stream 2 . &quot;
the dr@@ ones is enormous .
&quot; nevertheless , it was too early for an assessment of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump itself would have to give the sanctions an executive order to life . &quot;

&quot; with the third season , DE@@ A has directed its attention to the richest organization of the world drug trade : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kart@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful pins , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; only with more state records and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Damian Alc@@ az@@ ar ) is the leader of the cardboard , Miguel Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is its head , Pach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;

part back@@ wards : the city provides 46 kitchenette .
the city organised the K@@ ita @-@ lunch table once again .
with firm contact partners for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the urban nursery place the clock is turned back .
&quot; on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the urban children &apos;s centres ( Kit@@ as ) in its own country . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy director in the Department of Youth Aid , this is good news : &quot; we are all very pleased . &quot;
&quot; cooked in addition to house : a Cater@@ er takes over this task , and supplies fresh bo@@ iled . &quot;
&quot; the city operates 46 children &apos;s area in the area of 46 children &apos;s centres , in 44 the children during the lunch time received a warm meal . &quot;
&quot; last year , 2@@ 800 children were sitting at the tables , and the need for growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile eat not only children who are looked after 45 days of day , in the K@@ ita , explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children remain until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot;
&quot; 46 Parti@@ cles have from 1 September kitchen service : they refres@@ hed the for@@ ged food , they supplement the salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ er the meal individually , give the meal out , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are held firm in a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as the seventh @-@ scale facilities - decides on the timetable .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz satisfied . &quot;
&quot; so they are much stronger involved and it is easier to implement , educational concepts . &quot;
this is why it is about healthy nutrition and cooking .
the children should help to prepare the food .
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is very useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known power in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the pur@@ ging of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far the task of the chef - will in future be done by special cleaning personnel .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen , also the charm that it has placed themselves in the cost @-@ comparison between own body and foreigners to the city as the most economical one , welcomes it from the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 sub @-@ time forces are new . &quot;
&quot; but these hours drop approximately 750 people in the educational area not so strong in the weight , &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , the UN says &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative of all members of the Society , including women , play a role , said the leader of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ blocks , am@@ tier@@ i head of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women in the provinces of the United Nations said . three women run for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women can not be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in an statement . &quot;
elections can only be really representative and credible when women fully participate and be involved in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5th .
the Taliban has published threats against a vote @-@ trial which coinci@@ des with the transition from international hos@@ tilities to an advisory role .
&quot; this year , the elections for the first time will be peace@@ fully handed over by a democratically elected government . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ dn said , a strong role for women will continue to intensify the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an independent election committee reported that 1.2 million women registered by a total of registered 3,@@ 6 million voters .

GM@@ B concerns about investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
a trade union wants to look at managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ ite manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie over the long @-@ term commitment to production in their work in Glasgow .
GM@@ B Scotland said the company was silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the factory , which is next to other products of Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea bis@@ cuits . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives would be &quot; first experienced &quot; when their actions would change .
&quot; in a letter to the branch office of the company , GM@@ B Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s to express concern that funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be promoted . &quot;
&quot; GM@@ B @-@ senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we can &apos;t gain clarity about the needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , concerns our members deeply . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here , and the workforce strongly focus on the local community and the large living area of Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , the wage and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ xit , the rising life of life and the chronic manufacturing process , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needed a thri@@ ving production facility at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; said a spokes@@ person from Pla@@ dis said , &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ alle@@ iter at T@@ oll@@ cross has just received a letter from GM@@ B Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it as we estimate the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and GM@@ B representatives in T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that we are active as all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic environment , our business is continuously checked - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to be competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; over the past few years we have invested more than € 5 million in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we are fully aware of the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as production facility . should our operations change at the location , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
has the P@@ SG Barcelona warned three years ago in front of Ne@@ ym@@ ar ?
the page of La Liga likes its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain did not release Paris in its persecution of Ne@@ ym@@ ar after offering an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million , in order to ign@@ ite his free@@ ware clause , but did they warned Barcelona three years ago in front of the world war ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Po@@ g@@ ba returned to Manchester United States for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after completion , Ne@@ ym@@ ar becomes the most expensive player in the world and for the most affordable professional sports@@ men of the world . P@@ SG offers wages of over 500,000 GB@@ P per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry about the way Ne@@ ym@@ ar has forced its way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans state indicates that the club has always been his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago by the P@@ SG @-@ President of this prospect ?
&quot; when Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each club , who wanted to sign one of the best players from P@@ SG . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to let one of our players sign in , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish society in the beginning of this summer interest in the P@@ SG @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti . &quot;
&quot; P@@ SG made clear that it would not allow the international from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by lost one of its price offers for Ne@@ ym@@ ar . &quot;
sco@@ oter and damaged
&quot; during the night of Friday on Saturday there is a well @-@ known perpetr@@ ator one in the royal fields of street in front of the estate number 30 eliminated sco@@ oter , and thus directed at the cl@@ adding of the vehicle through more than 200 euros . &quot;
&quot; the Police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , telephone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for information . &quot;
to an accident at the B 2@@ 15 between Stol@@ ar@@ au and Le@@ ese seeks to witness the police .
&quot; because he went down to a car on his track , the driver had to so@@ ften the driver of a VW Tour@@ an and tou@@ red the guides . &quot;
on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um was on the road to Le@@ ese with his VW against 19.@@ 55 .
&quot; in the area of the hamlet of Stol@@ ar@@ au a car was contrary to him , so that he had to turn to the right . &quot;
tou@@ ted the Tour@@ an @-@ driver the leit@@ plann@@ ers .
on the car was made to harm .
&quot; the driver of the opposite passenger cars , a Mercedes Benz , had passed a truck and continued its drive without care of the traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; it may be good according to the accident , that the Mer@@ c@@ ed@@ es@@ man had not noticed the accident at all . &quot;
the police are now witness of the pre@@ f@@ essor as well as the driver of the interest experienced in Tel . 05@@ 7@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 with the Commissioner in Stol@@ ar@@ au in connection .
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen report ent@@ ail pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen report on the abuse of the Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
that means author and historian Michael H@@ es@@ emann .
the final report on the failure in the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen provides further discussions with the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen .
&quot; Christian Weis@@ ti@@ cian , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are Church &quot; , &quot; explained after publication from the former Regen@@ sburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year brother of em@@ eri@@ ed Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church very much , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express her deep regret about their own om@@ issions or her then false estimate of processes . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; critici@@ zed that in the coverage of violence at the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen with &quot; two different measure &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in regards to the attacks in Regensburg no one doubt that it would have to be &quot; &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful acts &quot; &quot; which must be punished and prevented in the future ; but the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; said the author of Lu@@ c@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historians and a member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of call the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of the everyday experience and preparing public opinion that is normal for normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in the interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; we are happy to go to the church , and that is a spot@@ ted fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in addition , she pointed out that in her youth she had been a completely normal educational means &quot; &quot; to be with friends , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for past decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with reports on the abuse of abuse , the Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often emerged . &quot;
&quot; completely wrong , says author and historian Michael H@@ es@@ emann , who with R@@ atz@@ inger written the reminder band &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says H@@ es@@ man , &quot; for all that had nothing to do with him , &quot; he values the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the diocese of Regensburg with En@@ ligh@@ tenment attorney Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen were killed between 1945 and early 1990s &quot; &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases were used physical and psych@@ ic violence . &quot;
especially at high emotion@@ ality the punishment for the students could also be disastrous .
&quot; nevertheless , contrary to numerous other voc@@ ations , many victims are estim@@ ating the general humanity of R. , and therefore in many cases despite violence even positive memories with it . &quot;
&quot; in an interview , H@@ es@@ man explains why the final report on the abuse scandal made by the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was on his opinion . &quot;
Mr. H@@ es@@ emann , the 440 @-@ Pages report on the &quot; &quot; incidents of violence &quot; &quot; passed on the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen &quot; gives a conflic@@ ting picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister George R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for one , many students stand out his &quot; &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tionist who was handy for the oil , if there was no top performance musi@@ cally . &quot;
how do you perceive as his bias in this final report ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : if you do the trouble and reading all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one must ask yourself more , why the name George R@@ atz@@ inger was at all found in it . &quot;
he has just been dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of we@@ ather@@ ing or co @-@ knowing during the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
also the acts of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool occurred outside of his efficiency .
&quot; it is possible to pre@@ dict him , too late , or not taken seriously enough of it seriously . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ing school , on which he worked , was felt by practically all respondents than - &quot; &quot; Rede@@ mption &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; Heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so also the vast majority of his pupils Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also portra@@ yed an excellent witness , &quot; &quot; sincerely , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; understanding , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
&quot; only a minority compl@@ ained about its perfec@@ ti@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which also led to W@@ ut@@ aus@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; he bo@@ wed not only with chairs and the key@@ chain ho@@ oked on the ground , but also ear@@ g@@ assed boys and too fre@@ ak boys in the hair or ears , he himself has already been a few years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and apologi@@ zed for them . &quot;
&quot; to his honorary salvation has to be said , however , that such education methods in the questionable era , the 1960s and seven@@ ties , were widely used , with parents as in teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think of each one of us who was born in 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I have also experienced that in a secular school , a state grammar school . &quot;
&quot; compared to what it is actually going on in this report , namely the irre@@ plac@@ eable sexual abuse and the violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , are certainly dre@@ ad@@ versaries . &quot;
&quot; one wonders if it is not asked about his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media had just fallen into him . &quot;
&quot; at Bav@@ arian Pope , yes , many who have never understood him , are still eager . &quot;
but the truth is : the release of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is in every sense !
&quot; in connection with the report , a lot was reported on the subject of abuse at the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s final report also put any ent@@ age or co @-@ ordin@@ ance with regard to sexual abuse on the load ?
Michael H@@ es@@ man : quite clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual attacks claims to have become familiar to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; said a def@@ ender for the others , &quot; &quot; There was all very embarrassing . &quot;
the real problem with the education of sexual abuse was and is that most of the victims remain silent .
&quot; if they do not even trusted parents and si@@ blings , then certainly not a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators . &quot;
what is the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen students R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse of abuse ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : a frag@@ mentary student interpreted it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I don &apos;t see any case in which he did ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) timely findings could have been and the perpetrators could have been stopped .
&quot; I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that rested ... Bu@@ bes an urgent or more clear or more , than in relation to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s , confidence instruc@@ tors , etc . &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ thin@@ kable . &quot;
&quot; thus , the report comes to the very clear outcome : &quot; &quot; the students involved in advance and / or their environment in advance , could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; concerning sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free of charge . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he cannot be accused of having prevented him or have brought it to the ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to connect his good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes as unfortunately it was unfortunately in some cases . &quot;
in the media was much of &quot; violence &quot; to read in the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister George R@@ atz@@ inger was thrown away in the report .
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : this is the big problem that in reporting everything mixed and mixed became a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; however , this is precisely the abuse of the report . &quot;
&quot; namely , there will be clean separate : between the pre @-@ school and the g@@ ymnasium of the domain , between sexual abuse and violence as well as , let &apos;s say , other allegations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report from the period since 1945 , therefore also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a choir leader . &quot;
&quot; the whole terrible testing pedago@@ gy , the cases where l@@ ad of sa@@ di@@ sts teachers were ho@@ oked and in@@ toler@@ ated and covered , all at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to exist . &quot;
&quot; but with whom Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister had nothing to do with them , because he got the boys first to face when they were already on the domain name . &quot;
&quot; on that was , as the most witnesses emphasize , the subject of &quot; &quot; Pre @-@ School &quot; &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
one was only happy to escape to her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; states .
what was different on the Dom@@ sp@@ line school ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : there were discipline , but there was no sa@@ di@@ st violence . &quot;
&quot; this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims are estim@@ ating the general humanity of R. , and therefore in many cases despite violence even positive memories with it . &quot;
thus remains at most still the accus@@ ation away .
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report was able to define only two periods where it was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he had just begun to establish himself and was in charge of the events on a school , where he was not working and responsible for the witness , and then again in 1993 . &quot;
George R@@ atz@@ inger consistently pursued the ears in front of the states ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ man : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ bu@@ g@@ ymnasium , who even reproduced the report . &quot;
&quot; in this he pointed out that , &quot; that in the pres@@ ch@@ ool I will continue to be practiced in the pres@@ ch@@ ool . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even in view of the danger of negative media representatives , he recommended urgent intru@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; this was of course at a time when legal clarity consisted , as audi@@ tors in Bavaria has long been banned . &quot;
&quot; before , it happened in a legal fr@@ inge area , like each one of us still knows . &quot;
that was hard to estimate how those affected might be exaggerated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the permitted border has been exceeded .
&quot; but one cannot say , he had always looked away . &quot;
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the inspec@@ tors in schools were officially abolished in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said yes , it is unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards to the then time . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; &quot; pit@@ falls of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; , &quot; thus the danger to evaluate past today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
the princess is already right .
&quot; of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ omin@@ able at all times , and also not for what was broken in the pres@@ ch@@ ool of resistance and violence to innocent children &apos;s sh@@ ri@@ mp , which goes far beyond that time . &quot;
this is all quite horrible and I am glad that it is finally working .
&quot; but at the same time , I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , for all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; its means to discipl@@ ining and punishment , so ear@@ t@@ edness and to pull in hair and ears , were widely used in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; as physical punishment then it has been banned , it has also kept strictly in it . &quot;
&quot; which picture of his Regen@@ sburger time has been restored Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because in the talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
came the topic exam@@ iner in addition to the language ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ k@@ ts XV@@ I. tells out of his perspective , and the dom@@ ic@@ zen played only a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I had no means at all that he led there a stric@@ ter reg@@ iment . &quot;
&quot; but that has to be said once again : without this perfection , it would probably hardly have been possible , from the until then rather nationally @-@ known Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen would have been an institution of world tran@@ g , true cultural message of Europe and its musical tradition , which went to tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1991 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and can@@ dies alone , one does not even make a great singer and stand before every success , right in which area , however , discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ lap . &quot;
what kind of human beings have you experienced in the talks about their book ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ man : through the work on the book and in addition , I really met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger and over again as a wonderful , hum@@ orous , ground@@ ing , deep believers and heart of good people from which you can &apos;t imagine it could be done just a fly . &quot;
&quot; I get regularly with how many former dom@@ ic@@ ings are still alive today , 23 years after his embar@@ ation , regularly contact him , to visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family . &quot;
&quot; those who have not for@@ given him to date , that he once was strictly among them , are therefore clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen are grateful to him today that he enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music .
&quot; and that he always was a good , father@@ less teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be , but still a lovely respectable person , to which they still look up today and which they almost worship . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clearly : everything you e@@ jects him are education methods that were then on the order of the day . &quot;
we can be glad that we have long overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; that is the nasty intention behind it , that is all too apparent . &quot;
&quot; for the report that has just been published , kidn@@ apped him . &quot;
&quot; now the attack was founded , a 93 @-@ year old man who has acquired great merits , and without the outside Bay@@ erns and maybe Germany no one would know the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen to finally leave in peace . &quot;
