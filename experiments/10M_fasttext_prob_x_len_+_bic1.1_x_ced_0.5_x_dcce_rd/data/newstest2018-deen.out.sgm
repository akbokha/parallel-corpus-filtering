<seg id="1">"Munich 1856: four maps, which will change your view of the city"</seg>
<seg id="2">A Irren-Anstalt where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">"a greetings, where now is excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel."</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the peasant reason for farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's nervous when landing cards are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">"that knows everybody who had to imagine, because the auto-Navi took place a green meadow instead of a circumnavigation way."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of Geoportas Bavaria of the State Government, are anything but current - but therefore very enlightening."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">"then, it is clear how cities and municipalities in the spread-area of Munich Merkur have changed since the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the digital Bayern-Atlas is a Flickwerk, which one does not recognise as such."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the great reference card, for towns and villages were more detailed cards, so-called urine datasheets."</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian surveying administration between 1810 and 1864 and jump to the first understanding of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your principal: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French Heeresführer occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Koalitionwar with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording of Bayerns, on behalf of course to military purposes."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if French troops went to the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801: they were the present neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph was driving the project ahead, founded the" topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bayerische Vermeasurable Bureau."</seg>
<seg id="19">The certificate of urine for Munich dates back to 1856 and is to be found like all others on the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison morning / Today is the state of state capital the most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subsendling that appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was formed 21 years after the map, thus 1877, as a Munich city district."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, the shelter in the middle of the city is located in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendlings concentrate around 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße, which was first named 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian peasants against Austria 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: in addition, a small-shaped map appears with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-written flowerpieces from the so-called" "Ureup" "from which the basic tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots show there today no farmers more - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green space is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, since 1810 Schauplatz, was in the 19th century in fact a meadow - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the field of urine, one reads in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen not only the road names" "on Gasteig" "or from the ascent" "On the air" "but also in large letters" "Irren Anstalt". ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstrasse lock you can once find people with madness."</seg>
<seg id="33">There was 1858 / 59 found the Münchner circle-irrenberg "On the Auer Lünen."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard from Gudden was directed at the institution - the psychiatrists who brought to King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended for example the chains of the so-called Irren.</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he is forbidden to apply to the personnel to apply violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen, who has employed for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients had been ranked first, later on 500 places were enlarged."</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the cycles in hair of 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-East, is one of Germany's largest psychiatric Germany."</seg>
<seg id="40">Now the area of the former Auer Anstalt are now meeting young people in Munich's Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and shifted it to a youth-home with an apprenticeship.</seg>
<seg id="42">"west is the football ground of the TSV München East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015 we set up the children's house" "Casa Don Bosco" "- in architecturally based on the origin of the Irrenator, who had been destroyed during World War II at bomb attack."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was listed around 1856 as" "main square", "the Buingerstraße was called" Kaufinger Gasse. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought to the Second World War even in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies were in the middle of December 1944 many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A great stayed until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English institute, small business buildings and a greetings from the Middle Ages was once at the Marienhof, where these days work and take place on 5 April 2017."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the air picture of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights group published travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the promotion of coloured has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri because of the discriminatory policy and the racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel advisory for the federal state of Missouri, which is to come into force up to 28 August 2017, calls for afro-American travelers, visitors and Missouri, as a number of fragmentary, raving incidents in recent times throughout the state and here are noted," says it in the opinion of the group. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recent law of Missouri, which makes it harder to win discrimination, as well as the prosecution bodies of the state, the disproportionate to minorities, prompted the group to release the travel warning, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have breaches of citizens' rights, men happen."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin colour, they are assembled or killed," said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such an incidence that we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group quoted incidents like racial decay against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died in fragile circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more fuel during the journey and taken by the police of Missouri, without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recent post-owned report of the Office of the Governor General of Missouri, in which it is shown that black drivers in the state will be more common in the state 75 per cent more frequently than white."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," said chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">People must be willing to bring cheating money or to know the relatives that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri signed in 2015 100 of hate crime according to the latest figures from hate-break reporting program of the FBI that put the state in relation to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri Law that would make it harder to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil liberties Union (ACLU) have issued travel arrangements for Texas and Arizona, after the states of immigration legislation, the local law enforcement authorities did not commit to persecute people because of immigration violations, which are contributing to the ACLU to further escalators."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel attentions are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but in recent times stakeholders have used the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Setting-down project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fisherman's Weidevils project is a success project and continues to continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Bundestag Peter White and Kordula Kovac have given a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the right-grabenhof of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fisherbacher CDU village met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann gave first insights into his business, in which it covers 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and also many young animals supplied and housed in five apartments."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "black milk" "is for him the alternative marketer for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaeste comes only regionality.</seg>
<seg id="74">"because he is also called BLHV-Chairman of Fisheros, he described the mist project as" "fundamental". ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can act on such a steep surfaces not profitable.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green space-surface for a lot of work, much needed to be processed with the engine sense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here to fight with the conditions and with the topography," "Schwendemann stressed."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003 he took over the eleventh operation and generated this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he is not a biobusiness."</seg>
<seg id="79">For Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "the Commune has recognized the importance of the consecrator project and is happy about the leaders promotion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, farmers must be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">"it is possible, that the forestation of the surface could be drawn up for quite a while."</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have, are the people working in agriculture and do thoughts about how to continue their operation," said the mayor. "</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism because of the funding</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the disclosure area is therefore 40 hectares, which are not allowed until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"from the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of the leader was promoted, a quarter contributed to the Municipality of Fisbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers left 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of Weidefence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you do a really good job, without farmers and land women."</seg>
<seg id="90">"also for Peter White was fixed:" "here the best food is produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Agricultural Policy (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state support of Weidefence.</seg>
<seg id="92">The destination is the disclosure of the Black Sea.</seg>
<seg id="93">The condition is the presence of one of the LPR-drawn conveyor cracks.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the strong area may not be tricky (Hanglection over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the forestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the fisherman's wheat-down project, 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build nearly 16 kilometers of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares, the lower costs are more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump will take the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime shift is to push when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the careful overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, knew certainly what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heat dispute with Jim Acosta by CNN on the proposals of the President to the drastic limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to be fair, Miller attacked not the statue themselves."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of Boatlandowners and Liberty-Imiters would have made him gelyncht if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he attacked their significance, and in particular the meaning that you were attributed to, when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after completion of the monument, has been added."</seg>
<seg id="105">"when Miller Acosta complained as Miller Acosta:" I do not want to enter into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem which you refer to is later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller lies properly properly, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about contemporary resonance to the suspensive words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" "your tired, your poor, / your suppressed masses who desire to breathe free, / the miserable trash of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"there was never a time in which the" "saving waste" "was better to see on our monitors."</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not committed to literary critic - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict with the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who settled to place their words after their death on the base - knew very well that they have accomplished a high-political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of Exilants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just like Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change this long before. "</seg>
<seg id="118">"the big scream of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for coming from Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty should not invite, but rather an early neo-conservative thing that bring the American flame into the converted world:" Lady Liberty is proceeding. "</seg>
<seg id="119">She is supposed to carry the Facket of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not supposed to enlighten the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and at all a question of the point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus consisted of them to see them as they came from the exhaustible, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the decks of ships was seen."</seg>
<seg id="124">"it is in the truest sense about seeing the world from the perspective of people, seek refuge and improve a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome you have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever wish to recognise.</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch should not enlighten the way but the hatred, who is their only source of power, ignite."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championships 2017: Neil Black loops Scottish members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle reminds themselves of a time when only two villi belonged to the team of the UK.</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance director of the Leichtathletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member states in the World Cup tournament will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">"a record of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" in Scotland "" something special "" and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it. "</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find it", "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type at the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is it's absolutely brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals of medals, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - which can be started against Sir Mo Farah at the 5,000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team for teamrider."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is rather modest."</seg>
<seg id="141">"her captain speech was incredible," "says Black."</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling that emilidh was totally natural, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth of silver medallists who will compete in their fifth world Championships at the 400-m hurdles, says that it is" "incredible" "that 16 bucks in the British team are."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes from the world championship was seven that have been reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">"on this path, Muir runs on this path and last year, five British and two European records set up last year."</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runners."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another scarf that was seen after a great season, which included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembered her first World Championships as the only other Schotte was in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the Mannesian capitals says that they are" enormously proud "" to the fact that many of their countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases also with the medals and the Finals. "</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing to be part of the team captain, is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so it was a great honour, but to know that my team-mates voted for me and chosen to make it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the treasures that belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to rise to podigs."</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech as a captain concerns?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">"it is therefore really important to put on this home support and benefit from it, that we are back at the Olympiastadion."</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go out there and compete, and there will be just such a great atmosphere out there."</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking of criticisms about Facebook: don't take you to a public office if you cannot tolerate the insertion of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something from bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans we loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers proposed it because of all, from home politics to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he slipped at the criticism, certainly."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not have his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for in 1783 Washington said:" "the freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we will be led as sheep to slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Howgans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on the official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil liberties are ensored him therefore at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the Stab of the Governor sent the lawsuit as a freevol, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with" Na, "and?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republique Governor in a overwhelmingly democratic state that is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">It has the two-highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillfully to use Facebook as the primary agent to connect with their voters and to debate his haired head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blockage of persons appearing on the side of the governor - which is a public forum that is officially designated as officially and by employees working with public tax currency - unnecessary, and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post defended Hogoanin Amelia Chasse the actions of the governor, and argued that the blockage of comments is nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too easy to use the image of flamming or spamming people, which vibrate the whip on line."</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments are respectful, thoughtfully and not profound."</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor crucified the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic Faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hwater filled, but she asked about hate crime."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented on the fact that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate, and other current news," wrote them in the commentary box of the message "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea when a number of people became a position on the same topic, then they are misunderstood by some rather than a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected people."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the staff of the Governors marked as" "concentrated Spam attack", "others would probably call" "mindset". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to watch a message by simply blocked a critic or a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in previous time when you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical notes, to burn or burn demonstrators, and to silence them."</seg>
<seg id="191">But that is exactly what is happening in digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticize that he has criticised Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is complained by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell in Virgina.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County last the first Amendment, according to U.S. district James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she nominated a voter by her Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU due to its use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so heavy.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of an affordable Portos had a similar effect on the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplies between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous briefers suggested for his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people, the pseudonyme like" "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belizarius", "wrote all the letters of newspapers that Washington's decisions made."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions, which criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain, overled his ministry, according to historical documents collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not have her silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses are the basis of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means to accept that.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan refinty hopes for home comfort at Renaissance Club</seg>

<seg id="1124">"financial Fair Play rules, which were launched in 2011 by the UEFA must mean that PSG had to point out some time, that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without great losses."</seg>

<seg id="1127">"PSG can certainly make money easy, so Neymar testified and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the Team through the energy rich ruling family of Qatar."</seg>

<seg id="1141">"while a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG, if the value of the sponsorship should exceed the standard marker, the UEFA would not apply this as a legitimate income."</seg>

<seg id="1317">The big life live: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment to a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced from a large house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a testament to the new design that Joanne has not packed their bags and sold.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I searched for something that was comparable to my price."</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I loved it in love and made a quote on this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first viewing, the 1,000 square feet was completely overhauled large apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room estate with a snowy layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne reservoir and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"this was my request," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, they commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed from Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, which was 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home which was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms in each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creative to solve the handover.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel plant is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were overthrown each other, without having to push us."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about building a simple platform, but to set the steel so that it had the right height above or at the bottom."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This alignment made it possible for Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with much extra drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine looks a classic copper window of retrouvius down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold-furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to make it longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The kitchen feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance it offers space for all the stocks and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">"due to the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went in," explains Erfan from the steel reinforced, furnified MDF-door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is very important, so it is when you push the door very easily, very easily."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain extra 16 sqm, an additional bedroom and improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day, you will sell the basics - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan. "</seg>

<seg id="1410">"that happened at the end of February, when someone had a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy rod of Katie Walsh to be the source behind a bunch of leaks in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was permanently banished from Twitter or that he has offered no specific evidence, or that he voiced false accusations in the past and revoke them."</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly Riodoce usually meet in order to review their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime; corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">It has been told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists will discuss what feels safer, they should take their children to the office, which were the target of an attack with shells, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"safety experts have written three words to a table at the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"please ask the reporters, names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions, and abdominal."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are Drug Administration, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are being suspicious of standing on the salary list of the government or the cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no rest of the violence, and while in the whole country the corpses are frequent, more and more journalists are at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took place in December 2012. 589 stand for attacks and threats under Federal Protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven countries."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter, her editors and their inspiration from Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest flaw is to live in Mexico and to be journalist, Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1820">"its lack is felt deep, although its presence is present everywhere - a great picture of valdez, which showed his midfinger with the word" Justice. "two reporters in the thirteen years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry T-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although in 2010 a Sone-Bundessecutor's Office was built to process the cases of journalists, according to the committee to protect journalists only two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of killings that are linked with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa although they are unbroken and although the terrain is now even more traitors."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting on the discussion of security has little benefits, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very silly to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know the Why, we distrust all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15th, Valdez left the Bureau of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed to drive just a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and was shot 12 times presumably because of the name of the newspaper - the" Twelve river "." "</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to wander freely in Culiacan freely.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the theme Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans arrest in the past year and delivery in the United States in January, Sinkaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, since rivaling factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it does not make that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people will be shot at the street or that the cemetery is full of expired, two-story mouse oleen for drug registers, which are bigger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget for a minute that there is a state of" peace, "if only a cartel control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February the publication of a interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaling cartels in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have been annoyed by the sons, suspected gangmembers bought every copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was not to force valdez, after the confiscation of another newspaper that had released the same story to leave the country on its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez has been a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing will be seen as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues were emulate that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he was active as a senior reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined forces with five colleagues to the foundation of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa, it was impossible to operate journalism without having to encounter the robatic problem," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1847">"over time, the newspaper earned a reputation because of the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising took place."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporter loved it, hard apt investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for their coverage in Latin America. "</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in pursuing the mexican drug history, wherever they lead."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trading in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">They have to take over the task which falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what did you do with so many dead... why did you not say what was going on?</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team missed Valdez, the spawning bird, who was like a harbour worker, the friend who knew generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">You trust his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always bear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayas, the bar opposite the office, go and always sit at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"well, ask: was his love for the routine of his destruction?"</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death has also forced them to question their own assumptions on how they work best, and they can stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they do not like it if you are dealing with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their home-home and landing cars" to move drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-keeping."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, keep away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the trouble is, the editors of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that" smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing with Javier has happened. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer in Sinkaloas, Veracruz, guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the staff of Riodoce met for security training, suddenly no cellphones were allowed. days before has been announced that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"out there were two policemen protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the State Government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-story building of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporter asked whether these officers belong to the 50 per cent of the police officers, who described the governor themselves as a trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week Riodoce has blown on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former known boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an Exposé to the State expenditures that focused on the hometown of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the Prosecutor."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was advisable to write what everybody knows in the city: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter took from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy leader who ruled the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (Pri), which ruled almost the whole century all political levels."</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several Pri governors have been accused of corruption due to high-quality cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this eatery, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman went a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months before the readers had seen the column of Valdez as the best informed source about the abduction.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"we had previously wondered what is happening," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO" because of its slim body statute. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication are broken with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez has been dedicated to storage space for signs and stickers, who are protesting against the murders of journalists, because employees have become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporters Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning to a demonstration for a further journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days, after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is of his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists all over the country journalists become silently stronger by rewritten in organised protests "SOS Press" on salaries and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day, the director Bojorquez is in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"during a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to raise journalists and bring it into it, because they have said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has since then asked that she is divided again by the government, because it is concerned that their anger has been violated."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico by organised crime, participated in government officials and an equal society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-journalism, "he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the command of politicians and security forces working with organized crime under a blanket."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"in the past year, the media-Wächtergroup" Aruo 19 "was assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you face, because they want you to keep the mouth disproportionate," "said Ramirez."</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously the murders have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the Northern border of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"your body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by the Zetas-Kartell," Here I am because of my reports. "</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer candidacy and earphones appear next to their separated head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">"some branches have chosen to close, like the newspaper El Norte in the Northern border state Chihuahua according to the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March."</seg>
<seg id="1903">"others continue, as El Manana von Nuevo Laredo, following the assassination of its director in 2004."</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly lifted the drug box with an editorial board on the front page with the title" What do you want from us? "</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have escaped from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as apparently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who stay left and continue working, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once he wanted to be, gives to that the drug trade scaling him scared."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and therefore I became reporter," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat in front of the office and drank beer, when all of their phones began."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A number of sweries with bandon-reefs and security forces near the bathortes Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war escalated further, as promised by a series of Kartell messages in the region. "</seg>
<seg id="1915">"from the on-board stone, they have published the news on the website of Riodoce about mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1916">The title page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens heats in the vicinity - a further shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">"Bojorquez cast a view of the policemen, the guards held to see if they were in readiness."</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid at all, they showed it not."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose centerfinger was visible for quite sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed its traces."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you also remember to close," said Bojorquez, "if the same day, where Javier was murdered, the practicant asked me to send them to the road."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used camouflage in order to soak its enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">At first sight it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying. "</seg>
<seg id="1924">"now researchers have found that the first findings of the unbelievable rhinoceros of a Canadian mountaineers have been so well received, that experts have described it as" Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs. ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">"it was so well received, that they could even find that its love of reddish was brown - and they said they could have had something from a" "troubled past." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the magazine" Current Biology "recorded it as" the bespoised dinosaurs, which was ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs in the world. "</seg>

<seg id="1928">"its incredibly well preserved state has researchers, which describe it as" truly remarkable ","</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant eater is the best preserved fossil fuel of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk when he was born on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that was missing from the surrounding rocks, and decided to see more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">That was discovered by him Fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years of covering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) heavy soil."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all of this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you just blinking the eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept", "said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is visible."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it is considered to be one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs specimens - the Mona Lisa is the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this plant eater, although it is covered with an armor and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by meat eating dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strong armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage in order to hide from predators, and used a shielding technology that is known as contrasts that are also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have been allowed to mix better in its surroundings and to soften its enemies, say experts, which suggests that it was threatened by major dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaurs was made for the first time in May and is now visible in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Borealopelta markchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours with it to expose it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"the amazing preservation of specimen was made possible, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the shape of scales and armaments on his body."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-counter, a widespread defensive method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the tip of the creature is darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter-proliferation is common, the results are surprisingly, as the size of Borealopelta is by far the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it points to the fact that the dinosaurs was hunted from sufficient pressure by meat-end dinosaurs, that evolution favoring the confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use counter-effects - think of deer, zebras or girdots - are much smaller and vulnerable as a prey, which signaled that this Nodosaurs was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, strong armored dinosaurs, how dangerous the dinosaurs carnivores have been to have been", "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skins shows that the skin of the dinosaurs rotbrown was.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal on information about his life, including his preserved performer to figure out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, pushed into a river and pushed into the sea, where he sank down on the back to the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time Alberta was as warm as in South-flame today, and rivers and oceans probably are much more widespread than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurs is really remarkable because it is completely covered with conditional skin, but also kept in three dimensions and retains the original form of the beast", "Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early chalk period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just have a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that he is at bedtime."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the Cretaceous time was a time, as enormous theropoden, carnivorous dinosaurs, who were standing on two legs."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, millions years after Borealopelta lived, the armored dinosaurs was hunted by some of his furious ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanvnosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons hewn monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"scientists, whose latest findings in the journal Current Biology appear, believe that Borealopelta has fallen into the sea after the death in the sea and in mud mumifies."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was born on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the bespoised dinosaurs in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely surrounded by the muzzle to the sleeve."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch-long tops made by his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the armored plant eater was swarmed by the Western Canada, up to a flooded river it flooded into the open sea."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater ascent of the dinosaurs kept his armor in an exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">"the petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved, that the skin remains still bumpy tank plates along the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as a profit in the lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I see it, the more confuse it will."</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">"on 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her heart."</seg>
<seg id="2021">"just one day after having arrived in New York City, the apartment was sitting in St. Louis, on the bed of an Airbnb apartment, which they rented and scroll through Facebook on their phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled upon a post by someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year child, and it is still on the road," says it there. "</seg>
<seg id="2024">"bewilly since no one else had posted on their feed, she finished Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly saved on her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year old, who was killed by a white policemen in Ferguson, Mo., killed, live."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of the Browness body that was stretched on the street and stay there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"this is only wild," Ferrell thought about himself. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She put her cell phone to return later in the evening to Tweet over people on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and people who cried out, and by a man who said to be a shield with the inscription:" Ferguson police have just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">They watched a live-feed in which a policeman was standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, desecurities another policeman his rifle and cried:" I will kill you... animals all kill you. "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"that is not usual," Ferrell remembered her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the nature of murder that we have used to us and which we can be called.</seg>
<seg id="2036">In this moment I felt chastily frost.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">You booked a flight back and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 23 o'clock, she fetched her 6-year-old daughter from the house of her father, and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets? "," in the cinemas from the 11. "</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which are of the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as a Ferrel with her daughter who took a caudal gown and a suitable crown, after Ferguson drove the two a conversation that they had many times before this morning" "about the black experience and the black condition."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I have taught yourself when black people have to fight for that, what they believe in?" they remembered what she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2044">We are going to Ferguson now because the police have killed over 18-year-old boys and that was not right.</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take it," said Ferrell later. "</seg>
<seg id="2046">That which is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">They have to know it and see it and be reared.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed not only activism and organisation, but also know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even though I have the luck to give her an experience, in which she personally does not experience a blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I feel, I would turn her a bad service to keep them away."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first stop when they arrived at Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a campground as the activists waiting for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business owner, who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and half to pass them on protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began to embrace a new type of activism for pigrell shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed after the 9th of August, she said and notices that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met Folayan in the evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document," what happened. "</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came into the meaning:" "do you document or try to find a story that you can exploit?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites, in a community that benefited from their pain and strength."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as follows recently in an interview:" "we heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson, have not centred their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the former Co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field, who is known for his activism around Todestrafts."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment was bringing the project closer, together with six other indigenous people followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years after Browns Erfurt."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking to us. we speak," "said Davis."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, how these people will be represented, because so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to concentrate on Ferrells' experience - to show that the movement is not about a Messiah leader, but about a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the best participant in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells life, as she loves and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that at this work and in the dehumanization of black people a certain vulnerability must give.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells repeated history the role of the black gay women in the wider Black-lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, which have shaped the film" "BlacklivesMatter" "in social media since the killing of the black teens" "BlacklivesMatter" "in social media."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in executive positions have borne the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to remark that" the movement is really held by black women and many black women. "</seg>
<seg id="2076">"it is however, however, that" this is not a affirmativer type of action, "in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film due to their identity as the heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who testified this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no coincidence, although it was at the forefront, because with a life on these crosses as a black, gay woman is so much at stake."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel your energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long ago disappeared, but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on the currency for 2 ½ years due to the blockage of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "a mess."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, she cloned off to a chant and she feels obliged to remember that she was three years ago in Ferguson on the streets three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We have to love and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "sizes": TV readers discuss about bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people even though it is not yet built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">"but the idea of a shopping centre on the southern part of the pedestrian precinct, divides the population in supporters and opponents since the first presentation 2009."</seg>
<seg id="2091">"cold, the subject is hardly possible."</seg>
<seg id="2092">Also on our Facebook-page "referendum and Bitburg" the topic is discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">"say one to the bit gallery:" "that would be a dream" "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" "does not need a man" "(Siggi Betzen) or quite simply:" "size bet!" "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the advocates is building that a gallery attract more customers to the city, of which the remaining shops benefit, fear that then the pedestrian precedes."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"added: the gallery is planned exactly on the property, on which the peasant hall stands, in which 13 direct market their products can offer."</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the beginning of construction work will be the conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="2097">"the gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and indeed, to the Beda-Platz with possibility of sitting outside."</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Room: "we've been buying almost weekly in the peasant hall for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the farm are always happy to enjoy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher was discovered for us too.</seg>
<seg id="2101">"we would like to hope that during and above all, after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer."</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"Gerd Densing:" "if direct marketed in a market hall in the gallery, comes to the amount of rent."</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, the new project is likely to be low."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why purchasing Palace in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothing, shoes, drugor or supermarkets: I find that superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You see how many cargo stores here are empty - some have been for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but here there is not even a decent weekly market, it is all the more important that at least preserved the market hall."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the commodity is fresh, is mostly offered directly from the producer and is mostly reasonably priced."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, cargo stores are located in a shopping center only by larger companies, because the dormant rents are often not viable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, special shops are almost no longer and what is left of it, will probably still disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a mall with a Markthalle does not fit together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where is the farmers market hall during construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the old EDEKA would be the solution - also on the duration, if the bit gallery will actually come."</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it already create the ghost bit gallery before, to sell all the shops of Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "this is simply not going to work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which stands empty, no one needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real peasant market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a peasant hall, yes, thanks to the wahnsinful many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg is no place anymore."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the peasant hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown that are almost imperceptible - that hang on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupstream and hair segments which were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth where the former secret service analyst sent a 35-year prison sentence after she publicly made as secret annexed diplomatic announcements on the website WikiLeaks publicly.</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming resemblance (A suitable similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was unified in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a transwife and groundbreaking disco whose condemnation of Barack Obama was converted, when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been extracted by the algorithms analysis of DNA that could be extracted from Manning and out of the 30 portraits - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinants of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but already since her puberty spoken openly about the identification as a woman, was sentenced in 2013 due to 20 accusations including six breaches of the mirror law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"through the prison, her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only a single photo - a granular, black-white selfie, in which Manning is obviously uncomfortable on a driver's seat and a platformer Persian has been associated with which it was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of its 2012 project "Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist portraits of strangers from forenical artefacts such as cigarette muzzle and chewing gum by creating the DNA from waste to create a picture of how these people might look."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when they received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press show of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated Muse were exchanged at unequal briefing that were exchanged for several years in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic" supporter "," which foresee a future in which the president would transform the Chelation verdict and it would be able to see the exhibition personally. "</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama is actually only a few days after the book was released, men's liberation after seven brutal years would demand in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome type of happenings."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also now at the opening of the exhibition a little lowly and triarkes, since Donald Trump will lead a war against informants dating back to government camps and against transgress troops to find new, tweet splits, which he actually should fix it further."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen from a particular reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in one on the wall of the gallery written down-written artistic statement, Manning with her oversized description below (the" "i" "in its surname is equipped with a heart) an end of the" automatic defragmentation whose basic sex, race, sexuality and culture have been. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence is written - a thousandfeet of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped, by involving the 200 characters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), as amazingly similar, at least in biological respects, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring, is that our genome is not taking care of who we are and how open genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories, also to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so they are 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is one page from the above Comic-Novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning as she appears with a release-cloister in the hand from the disciplinain of the United States as King-Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they put your speech, they have won," says it. "</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came right from a letter which she wrote to me," "said the artist, who greeted out of Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get geese, when I speak about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was foreseen in the comic book - but if they should do it, it will be welcomed in the center of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulacement, which collapsed as hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also focused on how everything was written in the exhibition until the size (5" 2, Manning Stature), in which their genetic Haplogins have been written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, such as the movement, which is also behind their liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his recent past the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a slip hole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-1980 and 1980-s.</seg>
<seg id="2292">"but Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from its cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents."</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who is dead for 300 years," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2294">What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England 'spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another, emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes, based on an archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only reacted on the thumb-pressure on the side of a letter, written by a double-car in the 1700-0s, who worked for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb-print!</seg>
<seg id="2299">"and letters always smell to smoke, for at that time they lit a fire because of the light."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"for someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he himself would be."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"Oh, I love archives!"</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so struck with old papers that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England ("To be honest: I found my welcome pit a little over") it all too nice to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle to watch the archives and study the many treasures and curiosities of the castle as about the moned hyena heads at the walls and the bottles having spent centuries in the ditch.</seg>
<seg id="2304">"he emigrated through the grounds and ruins of the old castle, and spoke to Landscape, gardeners, and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book."</seg>
<seg id="2305">"then, at night he drank" whiskey, and began to write. "</seg>
<seg id="2306">"the intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust received full access only in 2006 when the last Eram, Elizabeth Hussey died."</seg>
<seg id="2307">"when Rhodes met a decade later, the employees started to take care of the archive, which he described as" hundreds of years, in which aristocrats said, "Oh, throw it on the attic."</seg>
<seg id="2308">"diaries, letters from the time of English appearance, maps, those who possessed," You might think that landconflicts would be boring, "" says Rhodes, "" but there was a birch to have fought the two families. "</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let everything go down its course! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse on the wider base in the English story, including 'The Labourer' who leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant movement of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a recording of a rebellion which rose to 1380 in the castle, in this book entitled 'Knife of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes. "</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the farmer's farm began in this area and I thought, an uprising was a good start."</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps the two are connected? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">"other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - as' The Priest ', who told the history of the Jesuit patrons, hidden the family of Darrell seven years during the British Reformation."</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler' in which the smuggler of Arthur Darrell is represented in the 18th century (a discovery that was done only after years later than his coffin was excavated).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney: "the gentlemen seemed to be ok to always make debts and spend money for things they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"other generations of Darrell-men solve their debt crises, while rich old women healed, I imagine it as a heap of well-looking guys before, with a talent to advertise brass."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"after the end of his use in the castle, Rhodes is looking for another unique screaming experience."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"he has brought a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a Comic novel about Esmelmäki behind him, the terrain of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed from nature."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But Scotney has a special place for him.</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it may not be crazy in 2017, a new report comes about the technological developments in the field of sex robot."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, indeed."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex-robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">"recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robotics in the next five to ten years."</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, emeritiled professor for Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must start to take their Ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye colour of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingers."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make themselves funny, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr. Sharkey on the release of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpubs have evolved from their inflatable partners with a silicone skin which feels warm and with conscious human reactions to be achieved by the artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also adjust his robot according to his convictions" "and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the type of nipples to the type or colour of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it is still disturbing, since many robots have the" "personalities" "that would allow a stepford woman to be progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpubs have developed to robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot allows for example to adapt its users to the characteristics of their robots, which they are pleasing, such as relapse."</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex-robot with pre-programmed figures such as "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of relapsing and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality. "</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible," warmed the site of True companion. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so they like what you like, and they don't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">It also has its moods over the course of the day - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"it can be tired of being fixed on conversation, or it can be" in the mood "!" "</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects in this climb of sex-robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the lower female properties, the attacks on rape, when one gets a step on Frigid (called here: reluctant) Farrah,"</seg>
<seg id="2407">"on his website, True Lay Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibration, why can men then not have Roxxxy?" is it on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex-robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex-toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their generation and their growing refinement indicate a little darker and deeper understanding in our culture, to retreat from the ideal gender equality to a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional addition."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course keep no sex robot, and while the FRR noticed their growing popularity, they still remain on the edge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what permeates from the boundary zones, can be very instructive in relation to the spirit of the times in which we live, very instructive."</seg>
<seg id="2413">Many people are not strange or insulating until they give them the free market for this.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is yet certain overlapping that these highly developed sex robot occurs in a period in which the rights of women are threatened in the world, in which there is a president in the White House who has dressed women sexually."</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most awful aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the Magd ') are not the graphical images that affect the distorted body and the extinct eyes but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with Pornostar-proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want it to be human feeling that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to its" personalities, "robots do not represent real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">You cannot separate from their companion or simply walk away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background history, nothing, which refers to independence or anything related to the imagination of total submission."</seg>

<seg id="2579">"meat, dairy products and chocolate could help IBD (inflammation of the disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claimed precisely the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition, affecting around 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom 300,000, causing stomach vapors and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while the person usually get advised to avoid meat and dairy products, researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contribute to develop immune cells that promote tolerant intestinal."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the gut patrol to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food, do not penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells, which are able to resolve inflammation, are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"when the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result from inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments was noted that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs on mice that carry a certain bacterium into their initiates.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the components of proteins - to emulate the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one at Tryptophan rich diet tolerant, less inflammatory bowel, if the same system also wires on people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the post-doctorate in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigates a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study exercises such cells had, but another group of the same tribe, which was not separated."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"they suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbial pathogens had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which usually live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the mice of the mice, DNA sequencated and there were six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells, but without them lacking in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they were missing a intestinal microbial and did not develop these kinds of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria out to the immune system, the researchers were growing down to the immune system, and then carried out small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan-metallic ism that is known as an idol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food case of mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophanous values decreased, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-side products from L. reuteri developed the cells in men as they were in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said:" "the development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote, as these cells are inflammations on the inner surface of the intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2603">"potentially, high tryptophanvalues can lead to an extension of this population."</seg>

<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky vH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, the heart of the event was held on 17 July at the White House with American construction programmes."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Chief Executive Officer of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"the helicopter created in Connecticut, in addition to a yacht from Maine, a fireman car from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the Military Office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in an fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter on the South Lawn landed, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit, which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I only wanted to be aware that you are aware of it because it is such an ordinary event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event of his superiors, the deputy naval commander. "</seg>
<seg id="2721">"the message showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 p.m. at 7 p.m. in the morning at the South Lawn for the event at 3 pm, and so long stayed until the lawn was vacated between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on this evening."</seg>

<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commander. "</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you are locked," said the deputy commander. "</seg>
<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But official events also have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the president gave a impetus for the reform of the health sector reform that was underway at the Senate, and he tried the efforts to suspects the government's regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"the use of the aircraft that is known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon."</seg>

<seg id="2885">"the driver of the opposite passenger cars, a Mercedes Benz, had passed a truck and continued its drive without care of the traffic accident."</seg>
<seg id="2886">"it may be good according to the accident, that the Mercedesman had not noticed the accident at all."</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen report entail pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse of the Pope Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">That means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the failure in the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions with the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weistician, spokesman of the reform movement" We are Church "," explained after publication from the former Regensburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year brother of emeried Pope Benedict XVI, an apology. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church very much, if Müller and Ratzinger would express her deep regret about their own omissions or her then false estimate of processes."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican newspaper" "Osservatore Romano" "criticized that in the coverage of violence at the Domspatzen with" two different measure "." "</seg>
<seg id="2895">"in regards to the attacks in Regensburg no one doubt that it would have to be" "shameful and shameful acts" "which must be punished and prevented in the future; but the" degree of media manipulation, "said the author of Lucetta Scaraffia, historians and a member of the national Italian Bioethics committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of call the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of the everyday experience and preparing public opinion that is normal for normal," writes Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" we are happy to go to the church, and that is a spotted frescoes. "</seg>
<seg id="2898">"in addition, she pointed out that in her youth she had been a completely normal educational means" "to be with friends, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it is unfair to apply today's standards for past decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with reports on the abuse of abuse, the Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger often emerged."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely wrong, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who with Ratzinger written the reminder band" My brother of Pope "" (translated into 12 languages). "</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesman, "for all that had nothing to do with him," he values the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report submitted by the diocese of Regensburg with Enlightenment attorney Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were killed between 1945 and early 1990s" "victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it says to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" in summary, that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases were used physical and psychic violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially at high emotionality the punishment for the students could also be disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, contrary to numerous other vocations, many victims are estimating the general humanity of R., and therefore in many cases despite violence even positive memories with it."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in an interview, Hesman explains why the final report on the abuse scandal made by the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger was on his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-Pages report on the "" incidents of violence "" passed on the Regensburger Domspatzen "gives a conflicting picture of Domkapellmeister George Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for one, many students stand out his" "humanity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist who was handy for the oil, if there was no top performance musically."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you perceive as his bias in this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you do the trouble and reading all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one must ask yourself more, why the name George Ratzinger was at all found in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just been dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of weathering or co-knowing during the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also the acts of violence at the preschool occurred outside of his efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"it is possible to predict him, too late, or not taken seriously enough of it seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzenging school, on which he worked, was felt by practically all respondents than -" "Redemption", "" "Heaven" "and" "better world". ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"so also the vast majority of his pupils Georg Ratzinger also portrayed an excellent witness," "sincerely," "competent," "competent," "competent," "competent," "competent," "competent," "and" "understanding," "and" "always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complained about its perfectiism and its high emotionality, which also led to Wutausages."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"he bowed not only with chairs and the keychain hooked on the ground, but also eargassed boys and too freak boys in the hair or ears, he himself has already been a few years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for them."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"to his honorary salvation has to be said, however, that such education methods in the questionable era, the 1960s and seventies, were widely used, with parents as in teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think of each one of us who was born in 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I have also experienced that in a secular school, a state grammar school."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what it is actually going on in this report, namely the irreplaceable sexual abuse and the violence at the preschool, are certainly dreadversaries."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"one wonders if it is not asked about his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media had just fallen into him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"at Bavarian Pope, yes, many who have never understood him, are still eager."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the release of Georg Ratzinger is in every sense!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in connection with the report, a lot was reported on the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger's final report also put any entage or co-ordinance with regard to sexual abuse on the load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesman: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual attacks claims to have become familiar to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "said a defender for the others," "There was all very embarrassing."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the education of sexual abuse was and is that most of the victims remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they do not even trusted parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">What is the Domspatzen students Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a fragmentary student interpreted it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I don't see any case in which he did (Georg Ratzinger) timely findings could have been and the perpetrators could have been stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for really absurd to assume that rested... Bubes an urgent or more clear or more, than in relation to their parents, internats, confidence instructors, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"thus, the report comes to the very clear outcome:" "the students involved in advance and / or their environment in advance, could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"concerning sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in this way, he cannot be accused of having prevented him or have brought it to the ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to connect his good name with these conflicting crimes as unfortunately it was unfortunately in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media was much of "violence" to read in the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister George Ratzinger was thrown away in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in reporting everything mixed and mixed became a huge melange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"however, this is precisely the abuse of the report."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, there will be clean separate: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the domain, between sexual abuse and violence as well as, let's say, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report from the period since 1945, therefore also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choir leader."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole terrible testing pedagogy, the cases where lad of sadists teachers were hooked and intolerated and covered, all at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous states have to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with whom Domkapellmeister had nothing to do with them, because he got the boys first to face when they were already on the domain name."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on that was, as the most witnesses emphasize, the subject of" "Pre-School" "tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape to her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the Domspline school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there were discipline, but there was no sadist violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that" many victims are estimating the general humanity of R., and therefore in many cases despite violence even positive memories with it. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">Thus remains at most still the accusation away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods where it was reported by the states at the preschool."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he had just begun to establish himself and was in charge of the events on a school, where he was not working and responsible for the witness, and then again in 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">George Ratzinger consistently pursued the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesman: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Domspatzbugymnasium, who even reproduced the report."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he pointed out that," that in the preschool I will continue to be practiced in the preschool. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">"" "even in view of the danger of negative media representatives, he recommended urgent intrusion."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was of course at a time when legal clarity consisted, as auditors in Bavaria has long been banned."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before, it happened in a legal fringe area, like each one of us still knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">That was hard to estimate how those affected might be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permitted border has been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but one cannot say, he had always looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the inspectors in schools were officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said yes, it is unfair to apply today's educational standards to the then time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the" "pitfalls of Anachronism", "thus the danger to evaluate past today's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and also not for what was broken in the preschool of resistance and violence to innocent children's shrimp, which goes far beyond that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all quite horrible and I am glad that it is finally working.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, for all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"its means to disciplining and punishment, so eartedness and to pull in hair and ears, were widely used in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"as physical punishment then it has been banned, it has also kept strictly in it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"which picture of his Regensburger time has been restored Georg Ratzinger, because in the talks with you for the book" My brother of Pope ""? "</seg>
<seg id="2982">Came the topic examiner in addition to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedikts XVI. tells out of his perspective, and the domiczen played only a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I had no means at all that he led there a stricter regiment."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but that has to be said once again: without this perfection, it would probably hardly have been possible, from the until then rather nationally-known Regensburger Domspatzen would have been an institution of world trang, true cultural message of Europe and its musical tradition, which went to tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1991) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and candies alone, one does not even make a great singer and stand before every success, right in which area, however, discipline, passion and self-overlap."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of human beings have you experienced in the talks about their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesman: through the work on the book and in addition, I really met Georg Ratzinger and over again as a wonderful, humorous, grounding, deep believers and heart of good people from which you can't imagine it could be done just a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I get regularly with how many former domicings are still alive today, 23 years after his embaration, regularly contact him, to visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who have not forgiven him to date, that he once was strictly among them, are therefore clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domspatzen are grateful to him today that he enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he always was a good, fatherless teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be, but still a lovely respectable person, to which they still look up today and which they almost worship."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clearly: everything you ejects him are education methods that were then on the order of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominently and has an even prominent brother to make the medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"that is the nasty intention behind it, that is all too apparent."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report that has just been published, kidnapped him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the attack was founded, a 93-year old man who has acquired great merits, and without the outside Bayerns and maybe Germany no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen to finally leave in peace."</seg>
