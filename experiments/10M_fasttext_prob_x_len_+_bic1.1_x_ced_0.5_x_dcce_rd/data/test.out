Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on : I will always put in drawers
Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on does not always have to be perfect or successful .
this has made clear the Hollywood star in an interview now un@@ ambiguous .
&quot; I will always put in drawers or recorded from the outside label , who often have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
&quot; I myself do not have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; honestly speaking , these things are more likely to me . &quot;
Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on ( 47 ) can only laugh that she is known as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opolitan . &quot;
&quot; most ad@@ ress spends her time at home , pre@@ m TV with lo@@ cker@@ em D@@ utt and Mexican food , it is in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; for the white gl@@ ut , they bring the question of the children &apos;s desire : &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or children to be totally &quot; , &quot; the Hollywood star . &quot;
in her new film &quot; mother &apos;s Day - love is not a breeze &quot; is An@@ ist@@ on as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs with us from 25 August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sport@@ pyram@@ ide
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger searched for a little variation with a few colleagues on the beach . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sport@@ pyram@@ ide &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a couple of minutes the horses reminded of their evening , they said in the fast g@@ allo@@ p in the home to the for@@ age . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at that temp@@ o , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and thus the riding career ended up again .
on Saturday the best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament wins - back near horses .
&quot; he sent himself with his family over the facility of the AL@@ RV , on a horse , he hum@@ bled himself not even for photo purposes . &quot;
this was the first time in Aachen and also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports team handed over the man from An@@ hausen within the framework of a small Gala on the Golden Sport@@ pyram@@ ide .
in awards it lacks the sympathetic athle@@ te .
Bundes@@ verfassungs@@ kreu@@ z , silver @-@ Tour Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions Tour @-@ Player of the Year ... &quot;
even the British Queen took him already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; long is the 18th winner of the Sport@@ pyram@@ ide . &quot;
&quot; at Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this award means a lot , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because it is not only given for sporty successes but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger promotes the offspring . &quot;
and so he also gave the prize money for 25.000 Euro .
&quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ year Master@@ s@@ si@@ eger was added to the &quot; Hall of Fame of the German Sports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; among the nom@@ inees were Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Sch@@ mit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ fts , Alexander P@@ ush and Ar@@ nd Sch@@ mit@@ t , the Ru@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ ene@@ ke , the J@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ ene@@ ke , the cher@@ ub Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the hand@@ some Erhard . &quot;
many of these sports@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustr@@ ative company emigr@@ ated to the Spring@@ stadi@@ on , where the Lav@@ az@@ za price was running . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held a distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ &apos;s and Tr@@ umps economic policies compared : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the Trade Agreement of T@@ TP - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; un@@ one are the two US presidential elections , however , in tax and energy policy , as well as in a basic demand . &quot;
&quot; differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a basic , more philosophical difference . &quot;
that is the role of the State .
&quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubt rather small , warning about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot;
Clinton wants to mo@@ urn the economy and regulate the economy he says .
&quot; himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , claims Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he will firmly re@@ boot regul@@ ators , and makes it strong for a wide @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses . &quot;
&quot; Clinton said against it : the state has certain tasks to fulfill , he has disadvantaged chances and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the taxes for the rich would increase , says it . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the need to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton will say almost to the same . &quot;
the democratic assessment at all announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ war@@ y @-@ wing of Re@@ public@@ ans .
&quot; in Tr@@ ump , there could be a partial internal discussion . &quot;
the differences in energy and climate policies are evident .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive coal mining in the US again .
oil funding should also be possible in so far protected areas to announce the Paris climate protection agreement .
&quot; in contrast , Clinton wants to strengthen and call for renewable energies with their investment program : &quot; a country will create the Clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; but not only in infrastructure - also at international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ de trade agreement , both want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both the US does not want to isolate the US by international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs . &quot;
the should then be paid better then for instance Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollar is a hunger .
it wants to increase it on 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tr@@ ump will do in this question is not quite clear : once he says , The minimum wage must be up , then he says he should not be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics keep him before , that the budget deficit would only be greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton is standing at least from the rich , that they pay more taxes and their critics say , more taxes are not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; any woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is part of women who flee alone , almost for everyday life . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen sit four women .
&quot; each one has a baby , which is at most a year old . &quot;
one has laid her small son into the arm .
he was curious with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother is sitting on the top top .
until she noted that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ sed the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; it is the business leader of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social aid offerings in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the subject of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are p@@ oul@@ dering .
&quot; they live in the Munich North , in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for all @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made up the facility together with Pro family and Munich &apos;s commission@@ er . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot;
&quot; 60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children . &quot;
men do not exist - also not as visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ation to say : every woman being here , has made her flight experience with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee for wars because they are pro@@ secuted politically because they threaten torture or death , or because their families send them as a hope of hope to Europe &quot; , &quot; she tells . &quot;
&quot; in women are ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; many ste@@ al themselves secretly , because they do not see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland they have made experience of sexual violence , forced marriages , honorary mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
it drives them away .
on the run goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ gs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is no r@@ arity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe that the end as soon as they anchor in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; even here , common women in refugees would often be regarded as inferior and worse . &quot;
&quot; this leads to that about 90 percent of women living in Munich &apos;s property , traumati@@ zed in Munich . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so familiar that they have nothing to say .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; since they often don &apos;t want to cure , there are more accommodations only for them , demands B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven districts are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question , whether they are using a similar project like in Munich in its jurisdiction , answer some with no . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Palat@@ inate and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there are such a thing in the governments of the governments . &quot;
&quot; also in Schw@@ aben , alone women are not accommodated alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher of the Government . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are some common shel@@ ters or own houses for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommodated separately by men . &quot;
&quot; in a study published by the Committee , it is said : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot;
&quot; if privacy or women and women are accommodated together , it may take to - constant - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; especially the washing rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , standing in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel mis@@ understanding of this protection , you can read the d@@ unge@@ ons coming to the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since it has been around that there are us , we have a long queue , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
it could easily be a second house .
assistance systems : demands for new working conditions
the deputy of the assistance ists have called for their union to approve new work@@ flow measures in their dispute over a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council from early September to approve more work measures .
&quot; the J@@ DC said that there would be Ministers meeting , to respond to the concerns of the contract . &quot;
assistance and medical students have voted in July about the rejection of a contract which was agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who was released on Twitter on Thursday night , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government pers@@ isted calm &quot; to problems , what led the treaty was denied . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Executive Board adapted the proposed new contract completely to reject , and official new negotiations for all those who are concerned . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government the J@@ DC Executive Board approved a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council , in order to escal@@ ate a running program of escal@@ ating work measures , which starts early September . &quot;
&quot; disputes led to the fact that Ass@@ istenz@@ ists this year were sixteen , the first total incidents in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the BM@@ A Ass@@ ists , Dr. Johann Mal@@ a@@ wana came after the election to reject the agreed agreement , which had been recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A Members during the sessions , which were still held before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 Ass@@ istenz@@ ists and medical students , with that the agreement should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jer@@ emy Hun@@ t said that the contract for physicians would be introduced in England . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and to pro@@ claim an official end of the eight months long @-@ lasting war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gold hall of the St. Petersburg Palace , at the reception of the St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot rep@@ el the intru@@ sion that Ankara wants most . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile worked at the smile , and he barely healed warmth , even for its back @-@ in @-@ time conditions . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdogan , on the other hand , repeated by his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report full of five times . &quot;
I could not count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot;
the next day described a newspaper that Erdogan would have heard so much as if never had something worse .
I seemed to give my enthusiasm rather the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin @-@ radi@@ ant , sustainable cooling showed that the Russian President of Russia had forgotten nothing . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his quotes : the sealing of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was w@@ ut@@ ated .
Putin shared and accused Ankara to please Russia in his back .
&quot; the race was even bigger , since it was committed by a supposed friend . &quot;
penetration again will be difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; months long , the public controlled media led a fierce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; at one time , it seemed like the Turks to blame for everything . &quot;
&quot; most serious about the accus@@ ations of senior officials , that Erdogan &apos;s own family from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria would have benefited from the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has denied this v@@ eh@@ ement .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was allowed , that it was time to look ahead . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology from the President Erdogan that he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
for Ankara the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious .
Erdogan primarily requires all the friends he can get after he was at a failed coup almost his counterpart .
repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have made Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that are usually carried out several million Russian tourists each year to the Turkish coast .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia travel operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed .
it will count on a late seasonal ons@@ lau@@ ght on the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; this week anticip@@ ates the television reasonably priced fruits and vegetables , as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imported goods are allowed again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti discussed it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West as it was in response to the tried of power @-@ taking than weak response .
&quot; to this end , the ongoing group@@ ll of the EU accession negotiations and Putin has - the pi@@ vot@@ al to move out of the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; the Russian leader in Ankara won a bonus in Ankara that after the attempted coup , I demanded support for the elected government bodies . &quot;
&quot; this is well @-@ known for Moscow , a matter of course , which itself has a profound fear of reg@@ im@@ e@@ change . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this gl@@ oss palace made it possible for Russia and Turkey , one as it was a analy@@ st once described , &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that are rejected and poorly treated by the West and are now emerging . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the largest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support antagon@@ istic sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be indic@@ ative that after nearly three hours of initial discussions both Presidents said at the press conference , they did not even understand the subject . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey en@@ visi@@ bly reli@@ ed on a question about their differences , while Putin decided to stress this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denomin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after a few months of open hos@@ tilities - and considering the potential for a perfect dis@@ aster , when the NATO member of Turkey enters the Russian battle @-@ jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State had at least one another . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for clients outside Scotland no longer available
&quot; according to the Bank &apos;s Executive Board , the R@@ BS brand shall be reduced more to a back office . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ros@@ s Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with that the R@@ BS brand were connected to the global ambitions of the bank .
the Bank has since dist@@ ancing itself since they had almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; in this period , &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; have been used to protect other end consumers . &quot;
&quot; she supported international sport with millions of pounds , from six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by up to Wimbledon winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now she has chosen to put more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references will change the de@@ centralized head@@ quarter and the stock exchange for Nat@@ West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are others , smaller brands for the private customer @-@ customer business , which will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was interviewed during a visit tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B is being employed at our Invest@@ ors &quot; brand , as well as the brand , among which our employees will be employed as we are now more to a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS was made to the global brand . &quot;
&quot; I say now that we have no global goals , but to pursue local goals . &quot;
&quot; each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities , and our employees will work among these brands with the customers . &quot;
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer continue his six Nations sponsor@@ ing and that it will increase the perception of different brands in his sports sponsorship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of the Marche , as we are focusing on making this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal before three years , if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , there will be many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can restore these brands , so I think the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reached its 3.@@ 000@@ th win in New@@ market in Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spr@@ inkl@@ ed Champagne after a Double in New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ ,000 prize . &quot;
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ ,000 British win in New@@ market on Friday . &quot;
&quot; he sat on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone . &quot;
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reached the milestone in the low@@ land race .
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ chards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , Pat Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ star winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won before it on G@@ ha@@ y@@ yar , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
&quot; I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market , because I have landed here 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; there is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ aler Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the je@@ bel as he won the victory in Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in obstacles - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a recru@@ iting career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the ninth Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 careers &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of the modern age and it is not a surprise that he has reached this milestone just a few in front of him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect , which differs from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma fans for years already for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie in front of several weeks at Ep@@ som , that he had already fet@@ ched 6.000 gains if he was not just a weekend and big tur@@ ni@@ jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has done nearly 30 years of winning in Britain which is great .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a bri@@ tish race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical flying discs
&quot; from flying finishes to flying discs , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of British low@@ land for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve @-@ wr@@ acking .
&quot; a whole series of large tournaments , including its famous &quot; smooth si@@ pping &quot; &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug . &quot;
&quot; three years ago he had difficulty returning , when he returned from his six month of six months , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to de@@ fy its branches and return to his record . &quot;
and he is not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with cont@@ ests up to his at least 50@@ .@@ ten years of age .
Russia Putin fired staff Prime Minister Sergei Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin dis@@ missed his position Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of the closest conspir@@ ators of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old has been appointed as a Special Representative for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , it is that Putin without stating reasons &quot; dis@@ mis@@ sal Ivan@@ ov@@ s arranged by his duties as Chairman of the Russian presidential system . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was deputy president since 2012 , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in 1972 at the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he made his mark at the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , it means ( in Russian ) that he later was a protocol manager and director of the government personnel . &quot;
&quot; he said about his appointment he said to Putin , &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
I think that it is the most important task of the government to support your work as a state guide on the legislative powers and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday concluded that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and called V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
how the smiling faces ?
this step has taken Moscow mysterious .
&quot; Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest associate Vladimir Putin &apos;s and works like he for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; chief , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men stated that the staff chief res@@ igned on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , here are only few of them convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so here is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
this is what nobody knows .
&quot; but the official statement - that a man who was once approached by the potential president , who once would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - came across great scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his comments on Putin , who are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It &apos;s true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation to tell me this very complicated item - you could almost say - Jewish post for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential system for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and like Putin former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , which was appointed K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people who trusted most . &quot;
once was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia as a third term of Putin &apos;s accession to the Constitution .
&quot; but this post was taken by another , near allies put@@ ins , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became prime minister before coming back to President three and a half years later .
min@@ ts Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he proposed producers
Gib@@ son participated last month at a physical confrontation on the set of the series in Los Angeles .
ABC Studios and CB@@ S Television Studios that produce the series expressed in a common opinion of his notice .
&quot; Gib@@ son who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ olog@@ ised on Thursday before the announcement of his notice . &quot;
at the set it came to artistic differences and dis@@ agreement of dis@@ agreement .
&quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot;
&quot; details of how the character Gib@@ son from the series , which follows a team of F@@ BI agents , will be released , according to the opinion of ABC studios and CB@@ S Television Studios are expected to be published at a later date . &quot;

&quot; I love criminal min@@ ds and I put my whole heart@@ beat in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in one on Friday . &quot;
&quot; I had hoped until the end , but this will no longer be possible . &quot;
&quot; I would simply like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and above all the best fans you could wish for a show . &quot;
the proposed presence of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled on 28 September .
ri@@ dd@@ les around Pis@@ ces which landed in garden in Ban@@ ff
a citizen of Ban@@ ff called for the identification of the fish help in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that it could act at the 75 fish around Sand@@ a@@ ale that were sp@@ ill over by a fountain .
&quot; Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fishes . &quot;
Queens@@ der Cros@@ sing : bridge now associated with Fi@@ fe
&quot; the £ 1,@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 &quot;
engineers have connected the North @-@ deck of the Queens@@ la Cros@@ sings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four extensions of the &quot; cover plans &quot; , &quot; which can end up to each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 s@@ lan@@ ted rop@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the £ 1,@@ 35 billion project shall be completed by May 2017 . &quot;
&quot; Keit@@ h Brown , the building site today visited a visit today and was one of the first who went from the country to the bridge . &quot;
he said : &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Queens@@ la Cros@@ sings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering of art from a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel , which alone was used for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the link between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the brid@@ ge@@ ck is a delicate activity that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; a total of nearly 79 % of the total tan at their place and the last section of the decoder gets today in Ros@@ y@@ th a beg@@ g@@ gle for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted up on the bridge to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in each brid@@ ging project . &quot;
this fantastic project presents the clas@@ p and deep @-@ depth construction .
&quot; after installing the last lane section , and its connection with the north in the North of Nord@@ tur@@ f , we had to so@@ ak the existing gap on the north or land side . &quot;
this was achieved by the end of the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 mil@@ lim@@ etres in the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity .
&quot; solid , since the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 meters long , approximately 6,000 tons of weight and a rise of approximately 3 % had to be drawn up . &quot;
&quot; he@@ wn , as the toler@@ ances that the team works , were tiny - on each side they carried only some mil@@ lim@@ etres . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men still have luck to be alive
&quot; three men have &quot; happiness to be alive &quot; , &quot; after they were thrown off from her fishing boat in front of fro@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station suggested Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T Alarm after a crew watching the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim in safety while their boat moved from their own strength .
&quot; we saw how the boat around turned around and turned the worst away , &quot; said the head of the li@@ f@@ ebo@@ at station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds had already blowing the boat except their reach until we left into water &quot; , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and on a bo@@ on without life@@ times was found . &quot;
they all came aboard the coastal re@@ tt@@ le boat and were brought back to the li@@ f@@ ebo@@ at station .
&quot; Mr. Jones said , &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water have luck un@@ har@@ med and be alive . &quot;
&quot; although the boot engine had a sti@@ p@@ ation , however , this sol@@ ves itself when the bo@@ ots of the bo@@ ots are rid of the person who controls the boat . &quot;
someone has been watching these men today .
heavy viol@@ ates - man sti@@ ff on his ex @-@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
&quot; like the police yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to get his personal things . &quot;
instead the non @-@ alcoholic wron@@ gs cut the clothes of his ex @-@ friend .
&quot; when this came to the apartment , he twice on them . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and on the body .
the police could take the perpetrators .
&quot; during the 50 years old clothes of his ex @-@ friend destroyed , he called his mother . &quot;
this aler@@ ts as a result of his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm down their brother . &quot;
but it could not move it to leave the apartment .
&quot; therefore , they went out of the house with their companions . &quot;
on the road they met the ex @-@ mate of the man .
&quot; when the two women che@@ at the apartment again , the ub@@ st@@ est of the 50 @-@ year @-@ old is his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ friend . &quot;
who builds Braunschweig cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Green mine : investors should in future be taken much stronger in the future .
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the coming years ?
&quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; action concept &quot; &quot; to the next R@@ ats@@ meeting . &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
&quot; first and foremost , it is about the question : who should actually build the cheap apartments ? &quot;
a provision is missing so far .
&quot; SPD group leader Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Greens : &quot; &quot; who want to build on urban areas , will in future be able to exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be in stock . &quot;
&quot; however , the great dispute point in the Town Hall was , however , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; how is you going to cope with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors on such a scale at least 10 percent , but as per as 20 percent of the apartments are building as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban residential building program , which will cost million costs and is still being financed , should provide incentives for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the groups . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few as possible .
the left still wants to maintain hardness for investors .
&quot; regardless of this , as Brat@@ mann , a ti@@ ghtening of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; the action concept , will be implemented for additional tasks in the construction administration . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; the program is not entirely : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how is the loss of further around 1300 cheap apartments , whose funding will be running in the next few years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 alone , it will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; to prevent this , the plan@@ atory policy spokes@@ person in Nicole Palm , should now be bought out of the city now . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it would have to be thought of how apartments get back into the price @-@ binding . &quot;
this is possible in the West city .
&quot; in one fell s@@ woo@@ p , the problem will resolve . &quot;
&quot; since in the West , the end of the year is running out . &quot;
&quot; some 1800 apartments , one could get back to the price of price for cheap apartments . &quot;
&quot; only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social housing in the west city increases dras@@ tically , one removes itself from the goal of the so @-@ called mixture . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a concentration of social weak in just a few city districts will no longer be given . &quot;
the Greens count that there will be even movement in the discussion .
&quot; Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ ch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; for a wide majority , the CD@@ U must take into the boat . &quot;
&quot; although , I have concentrated on more construction sites for family homes . &quot;
but what does not mean that a compromise can not be found yet .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , which is worthwhile . &quot;
it &apos;s fascinating to see how the world changes .
&quot; that teenage children and child are not going to go out more outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time , at screens , has been t@@ opped by many in the last decade . &quot;
&quot; at Pok@@ emon Go , it is about getting people from the sofa and become more active . &quot;
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then to video games and finally on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and activities are not mutually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that was created on the characters who were created first for the video games in the 1990s ( later created a cartoon series , game maps and other spin @-@ off ) . &quot;
&quot; like many phenomena in the pop culture , the interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand began in early July . &quot;
the market launch in other countries was postponed by massive demand that over@@ threw the servers .
&quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go again had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players go out with their smartphone outside and looking for Pok@@ é@@ mons to be followed with a GPS as soon as they were found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a scre@@ enshot on the phone ) or &quot; captured &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game , when she was still younger , joined the W@@ ahn and sprang up for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , the game led to a considerable rise in steps that puts the &quot; average &quot; person every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ o@@ gram , an app for Apple Watch that followed 3@@ 5,000 users , shared the Washington Post recently with that within two days of launch of the game , the number of people followed by 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it just looks the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns to health , people want to bring about 30 minutes to take &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; every day to be active &quot; , &quot; because many public messages are boring and coming from people who look miserable . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be over@@ valued . &quot;
&quot; whoever drives on a regular sport , reduces its chances of being diagnosed with cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here . &quot;
&quot; but the wonder@@ full of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , that fun is fun . &quot;
&quot; thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun . &quot;
some people make hunting even new friend@@ ships .
&quot; as always , there are also mur@@ ders , who have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what should &quot; s ?
it has become a breakthrough .
&quot; even when Smartphone Apps like Fit@@ Bit could already follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to practice sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be repeated with time .
&quot; because of Pok@@ em@@ on success , however , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the assets in the real world and to be helping many people on the hunt , active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

and now finally Olympi@@ ad .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the multi@@ struggle title and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
your overall result of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly in front of the silver med@@ all@@ ists and &quot; Final Five &quot; team @-@ sk@@ amer@@ al in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze statue of Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; the Americ@@ an@@ ers Simone bil@@ it@@ ching on the pig @-@ bal@@ ken during the single multi @-@ campa@@ igning of women at the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth heter@@ osexual farm , which wins a multi @-@ campa@@ igning title and overall the fifth , while she has solidi@@ fy their reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
she broke into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end .
&quot; this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes , such as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sport to new heights : &quot;
&quot; it has dominated the last three years their sport species , 15 world med@@ medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympi@@ ad from 1984 Mary Lou Ret@@ ton from her said that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast , which I have ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it was expected to have a final test in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden @-@ dimension@@ ed expectations . &quot;
&quot; not return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the Americ@@ an@@ ers Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace you after they won gold and silver in the single multi @-@ campa@@ igning women at the Olympic Summer 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es fet@@ ched the first medal on Tuesday , while at the farewell meeting of the team of retirement , Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi served as a sign @-@ sign . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insisted , during their long way to the top , never the future is planned , this is not really true . &quot;
part of their soil conditions - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit at home on the road outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not accidental .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school@@ ing in the g@@ ymnasium , was trained in the bo@@ or@@ man , became the power . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , she has no longer lost a multi @-@ campa@@ igning competition , which will stop as long as it wants to stop . &quot;
&quot; even if Must@@ af@@ ina was easily guided through two screen@@ ings , the image over@@ thrown . &quot;
pig @-@ bal@@ ken and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es the World title holds - lau@@ ded .
she got up again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the pig and sat down with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embr@@ aced them gently when they anticipated their end @-@ expression - a pure form of form@@ ality - and tears poured on Bil@@ ha@@ gl@@ oss red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision that once described in her collection book . &quot;
&quot; the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a ven@@ ge@@ ance for the last time four years ago , when she fought for third place , but the bronze medals in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke at Must@@ af@@ ina went . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ year @-@ year @-@ capitalism had called &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; , &quot; a lead . &quot;
&quot; after its ground exercise , she cast out to the audience of Kus@@ um , overwhelmed by a com@@ eback , which was sometimes doubt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as in terms of this , the rapid T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old last week has a whole new meaning : &quot;
police : 3 victims in mass mur@@ der@@ ers shot at the car in the car
&quot; according to police reports that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot in one of the deadly serious attacks since a decade in the first mass mur@@ der@@ fall of Phoenix , while they had moved themselves in the car and heard music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefan@@ ie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th , while the car was parked in a transfer , said the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator hum@@ bled eight shots from a mo@@ ist weapon , while being on the passenger side of the car , and fled afterwards with another vehicle , is to be read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police shared with that the triple murder did not have been the result of a predat@@ or anything , as the att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ ance of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the g@@ imm@@ ick drew the investigation into it , a closer look at whether they are connected with four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; in total , predominantly in h@@ isp@@ anic dormit@@ ories were killed in nine months in nine attacks , and two other wounded . &quot;
&quot; it is happening in a residential area in front of a house , shared Howard of K@@ H@@ PO , an affiliate of CB@@ S , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
investig@@ ators refused to raise the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ it@@ alized because of their injury and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot . &quot;
a witness of the police with that it was not uncommon for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which was turned on an empty Pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and from which it is assumed that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ utri@@ ents and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball @-@ frag@@ mente from the Motor@@ room .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 years old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to the singing , toys , and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but like the least of its aging , Ed@@ mund micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during her pregnancy did not know anything . &quot;
&quot; when he came home the first time , my first thought I did . &quot;
I am not creating this .
I did not let myself .
&quot; what is wrong at all -- of course , one has settled on it , &quot; she said . &quot;
your husband Vincent and her husband told that Ed@@ mund can never recognize them under circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they were propos@@ ing to institution@@ alize him .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; stated Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a wal@@ ker .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor kr@@ ab@@ bles to his third year of life and he still cannot speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
he can run with support and ride bikes .
he likes to play with his two brothers and singing .
Elizabeth shows the string that Ed@@ mund for &quot; Please tell me something special .
&quot; we bring his letter to him , &quot; &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to CB@@ S News . &quot;
but it is not a typical language - she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the ci@@ ca@@ vi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of being infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to recalls the emotional price of an im@@ certain future .
&quot; I asked , what will happen ? &quot;
what will happen ?
and she still does not know .
&quot; I haven &apos;t wondered for the prognosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect that someone can really say to me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hope@@ ful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects that have been caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; fierce rainf@@ alls , floods , gives rise to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Mississippi &quot;
fierce rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floods in Lou@@ isi@@ ana pur@@ ged the governor to rest on Friday the emergency . it is expected all the Saturday with more rainf@@ all .
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast Lou@@ isi@@ anas and the south of the ra@@ pp@@ is flooded their banks , and rested with large @-@ scale floods in extreme rain @-@ cases , reported the National Wetter@@ dienst . &quot;
governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John Bel Edwards shared with the public authorities standing in constant contact with the local authorities and is already on the road to the affected communities .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ person for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ ation of the governor , shared with the requests for high water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that alone the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a had requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a floo@@ d@@ war@@ n@@ system will be used over wide parts in the South Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service allowed to hide that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ amas , on Friday a Fl@@ ut@@ e@@ war@@ n@@ system was used while in the area Mobile still ra@@ ined . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite is close to Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , all probability will be reached over the weekend record . &quot;
the Me@@ ter@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could be flooded into the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rouge .
&quot; he also said that a up@@ stream flood in Ascension is a danger , as it will only flow slowly into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest stand on Friday at 0@@ 9.00 . &quot;
rescue ste@@ ams still t@@ apped people from the fl@@ ut@@ water in the district Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the south @-@ west of Mississippi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were on those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , rising up overnight . &quot;
&quot; he said that he would have warned another step@@ son , who lives nearby . &quot;
&quot; we are awakened and the water shines and abo@@ unded in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
&quot; his wife told Hans@@ ford , that she lived there in the 48 years , in which she lived there , has never seen such a strongh@@ old of the river . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members could have all the disabled , and he would be the only one who can swim . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that Not@@ hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck , and they had brought them to the next fire@@ guard in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommodated till Friday . &quot;
&quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood &quot; &quot; pushed &quot; &quot; rapidly , as there was still severe rainf@@ alls and that the authorities ev@@ acu@@ ate ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer near Liv@@ ing@@ stone made from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the ground has been significantly reduced by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities insisted that heavy rainf@@ alls and street flooded the rescue of inhabitants from their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a Par@@ ish and classes in five school districts .
the CB@@ S @-@ subsidiary WW@@ L reported that an enclosed in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches which were both in@@ und@@ ated .
&quot; the rulers of the municipality Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities would have saved 72 people and seven pets , which were stra@@ ined by the floods . &quot;
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond were set up emergency accommodations in order to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; once the water starts back , they will return to their houses again , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the city of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a , there were almost two d@@ utz@@ lig@@ ently on the basis of the flood , and sand@@ bags are provided for residents to ensure that they are able to keep water from their houses and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last big flood which we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the Municipal Institu@@ tions . &quot;
this seems to become a similar incident .
&quot; on the pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it still ra@@ ined on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to its information , a handful of houses were reported on Thursday as in@@ und@@ ated , but on Friday they were not reported until now . &quot;
&quot; Keit@@ h Town@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; washed by balls , &quot; survived s@@ lag in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police shares with that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year child will be shot . &quot;
the grandparents of the boy identified him for CB@@ S Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grandparents gave that Brown suffered several bul@@ lets , including in the lungs , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was with his transport to hospital in consciousness . &quot;
&quot; he has made a lot , his little body was caught by balls , divided his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transm@@ itter . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe this .
the state of the boy was regarded as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy of the boy shared the station with that he is expected to be read again .
he would have to start the first class in a local school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
also shot three men : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to CB@@ S Philadelphia in stable state .
&quot; the boy was shot at the front of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is located in a critical state , shot shot , reports the transm@@ itter . &quot;

it seems that this is clearly a continual battle .

&quot; why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that &apos;s what I imagine among the women &apos;s olymp@@ ic ship in the tur@@ bo and that for more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have been at every summer Olympic Summer since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly , this team has three tur@@ ner@@ ers , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which is inspiring for many young girls of other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this squ@@ ad , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Catho@@ lics , round , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this crew is finally reflected in the US .
it has solidi@@ fied the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was one of the female Tur@@ ner@@ ing a A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americ@@ anism .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprise for the last Olympic Games in Gab@@ by Douglas .
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as she was unexpected , but master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ as@@ tics routine . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Simone became the fourth , heter@@ osexual Americ@@ anism , which won at an individual multi @-@ campa@@ igning event for women gold . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we are witn@@ essing the top of this sport , but we do not see the turn@@ around in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie smote all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison , to create it in the Olympic Team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; last five , &quot; because the next Olympics are only four turtle in the team . besides , this is the last year with Marta Car@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks so that Tur@@ nen becomes a more expensive sport and tur@@ ner primarily in private turn@@ around , who will be maintained by parents responsible for training , furnishings , travel , travel and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their Tur@@ ner and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ around are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support business .
in these verses the Tur@@ ner receive a whole training and this is a long @-@ term commitment to the families .
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , Train@@ ers of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , Train@@ erin of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both have trained their athletes since they started with the turbine . &quot;
&quot; we need to get inspired to the con@@ gregations of countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie to make a high @-@ efficient and easier access to exercise . &quot;
I was founded my turn@@ around 20 years ago .
&quot; for my events we have free and affordable turbines in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban teenagers ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) , and national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September , we are expanding to Detroit ( my hometown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality turbines that make the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; exercising develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long advantages for health as well as for training and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to care for the turbine and that &apos;s great .
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the olymp@@ ic team gol@@ ds and thank you that many young girls with different backgrounds are motivated to become their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistance would like to organise further strikes after they rejected Jer@@ emy Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
&quot; the Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes made by adopting a reform@@ at@@ ated contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of 37@@ ,000 Ass@@ istenz@@ ists who voted in a choice they refused . &quot;
&quot; in July Hun@@ t plans reveals plans to introduce the contract , and said that N@@ HS had ordered itself in a &quot; &quot; no &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; and any further delay to employees and patients would be harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assistance ists should receive a new contract , the changes to night and weekly contributions , in order to improve the maintenance of un@@ paid movements . &quot;
&quot; DR Ellen Mc@@ Court , the Chairman of the BM@@ A Com@@ mitt@@ ents for Ass@@ istance spent last night in a communication with : &quot; Ass@@ istenz@@ ists have agreed to the proposed contract , particularly that it is given the current occupancy of workers and to ad@@ minister it to treat all doctors . &quot;
&quot; only eight weeks , who still remain , until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract need to be made progress and the time runs out . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; efforts by the BM@@ A to resolve the dispute through conversations with the government on resistance , are taking part and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot;
&quot; it came to pass that of a promise , Jer@@ emy Hun@@ t had made it last month about it that his door would ever off@@ beat . &quot;
Jer@@ emy Hun@@ t must act now to raise the penetration and appeal to the concerns of the assistance .
&quot; if he should not do so , it did not have the assistance of assistance that they are ready to conduct further work measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a bu@@ cket of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments in front of as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in order to meet doctors on strike . &quot;
the Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes made by adopting the Treaty of Treaty with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A would like to pay a better wave wages for the 5@@ 4.000 Ass@@ istance ists , who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Manager of the N@@ HS staff , asked the assistance to finish the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; working conditions do not achieve anything but little , but already strain teams and service providers and prepare the patients , nursing care and their families only worries , hard@@ ship and interruption . &quot;
&quot; over the past two months , we talked to the Com@@ missions of the assistance of assistance and the Ministry of Health as well as other ministries responded positively to the concerns about the tut@@ el@@ age and wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wings . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility at training , training holidays and gender equality in medicine - a sign of how serious it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug that can reduce the heart attack
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug after having been recommended by the authorities to ad@@ minister this more people for a longer period .
the cl@@ apping drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attack for people with a disease .
&quot; the drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or a further heart attack . &quot;
the regulatory authorities N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS has recommended for a long time intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regulatory authorities N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS has recommended for a long time intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; some 140@@ ,000 people suffer from a heart attack each year and a quarter of it suffer another heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attack and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty acid in the arter@@ ial walls .
&quot; when the ban breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots , that causes blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; if the blood cl@@ ots triggers , it can flow through the blood flow and conce@@ al flow of blood to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
individuals who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to another .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ zen@@ eca and is driven under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ auses . &quot;
&quot; the draft design by N@@ ICE , which has been published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE health @-@ evaluation center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary education , a quarter of all persons suffered a heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have substantial negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or combined with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing further heart attack and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
&quot; by a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to bro@@ aden the options available to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is restricted to a period of up to three years . the draft design recommends no treatment that goes beyond that period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ an was flour@@ ishing in Muslim regions
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on dis@@ mis@@ sal of a government report because of corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ alling has led that far @-@ wi@@ dened election was kno@@ w@@ ingly ignored in Muslim communities such as a crus@@ hing government report today .
&quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les acc@@ esses the police , Elec@@ toral and Rath@@ geber to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ nie and religion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and local government , which is now a antagon@@ isms , said that the intimi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would have been so bad that the police should be allowed to set off cr@@ abs outside of electoral rolls to be intimi@@ dated voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should lead a certificate in order to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; currently , a vot@@ er must merely call his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report proposes to raise not remot@@ ely ink upon the finger of a person , if they give their choice to prevent someone twice . &quot;
wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers should get more protection than Sir Eric .
he calls for the press should have more access to municipal officials and decisions of non @-@ official or working groups .
&quot; this not only serves the election was , but is also the communal government in front of the broader corruption and financial @-@ tru@@ ce culture that goes along with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets franchise than in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special court decided that the am@@ ti@@ ating Mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be enth@@ r@@ alled at the corrupt and illegal practices of his counterpart . &quot;
&quot; the court was that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal manner , &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with se@@ am and Islam@@ ophobia . &quot;
&quot; Rah@@ man should have led his campaign on the basis that it is the relative duty of Muslims , to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 voices were either doubt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation , where one person chooses one another . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud all over the country .
&quot; in particular , he was expressed particularly alar@@ ming for frau@@ dul@@ ent correspondence , where older members of the Muslim community had pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the fo@@ als of pointing out to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in its report it is said : &quot; &quot; as proof that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been practiced , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elder , in particular communities with Pakistan or ban@@ ish background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions such a behavior would have ignored such a behavior due to &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ nie and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists can be dealt with in order to re@@ ap &quot; &quot; election &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also demands tougher registration testing in order to prevent the electoral directory of im@@ migrant and social tru@@ ce purposes . &quot;
consider choices to ask voters ahead of choice according to your ID .
&quot; do not remove remot@@ ely Tin@@ te on the finger of a person as soon as she has released their voice to prevent someone twice . &quot;
systematic reasoning about the nationality of a person to make sure they are either authorized .
a three @-@ year @-@ old limit to applications for an automatic stamp .
prohibition that political activists will handle full stamp and cover of stamp .
&quot; the police give the authority to set off election stations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a legislative change which facilit@@ ates an indictment for intimi@@ dation according to the representation of the People Act 1983 ( popular representative law in 1983 ) .
photography offered in election stations .
requirement that only English can be used in electoral stations ( except Wales ) .
Inten@@ si@@ vation of the training to ensure that the employees generally enforce that voters alone go into the electoral cabin .
&quot; Sir Eric falls beyond the Metropolitan police and finds it &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case not show off . &quot;
&quot; the electoral court has explained Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for because of a li@@ gn@@ ite in corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; he said . &quot;
it was sufficiently well @-@ known because of a number of reasons required - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ controls &quot; of the Rath@@ geber .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court part in Tower Ham@@ lets of the last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country carries a proud heritage as the mother of the parliaments , but the worrying and covered propag@@ ation of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ doubled in and other famous twin @-@ go@@ ers of Olympi@@ as in Rio
fans of the Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio are out this week about the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot except edge and band who turned out to be an impressive double day in the Duke of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year Olympi@@ oni@@ kin is by no means the only one for gold war@@ ring gold which has its own famous double @-@ go@@ ers - at least not to give the social media faith .
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , which at the time on our monitors fli@@ ers , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a list of Olympi@@ ad who have more than just a certain similarity with hol@@ ly@@ ri@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o . &quot;
&quot; apart from K@@ ates double , many people on the net showed up many people on the Internet to be like a certain ar@@ cher of the Twin @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the U.S. team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a storm on Twitter after pictures , on which he sees the wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ secretly similar . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher was given the madness to the social media with and gave to that he has already been hearing from his childhood , that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself don &apos;t see any great similarity , except the facial hair , divided Bra@@ dy of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I found this as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the center : the sincere similarity between the British vast@@ inger Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its large , expres@@ sive eyes is intended to go through double @-@ day in for the Cub@@ an American singer &quot;
and in the swimming pool the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
one course higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor .
another persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and Ac@@ tor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett that has similar severe eyeb@@ rows and lips .
&quot; the Russian silver med@@ all@@ ill@@ ary floating in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun@@ ni@@ b@@ ted skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan has been rep@@ uted by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes &quot;
not the only thing : a Twitter user was very happy that others have enjoyed the similarities too .
theory put into the room : according to this user there is a reason for the similarity of the pair .
&quot; a Twitter @-@ U@@ ser@@ in declared their satisfaction , that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the US @-@ foot@@ star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter an incredibly similar facial form and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular comparisons of Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and their smile , which is almost identical to the President Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal in Tur@@ ing Gab@@ by Douglas , which has its own gorgeous , wide smile that resembles that from Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;

&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and a unhappy wording . B@@ yron does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning , Mac@@ Donald was used in the broadcast and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was not designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment for a moment to apologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s razor in the C@@ BC Olympi@@ ad , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have moved me to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers in and not on them as a person . &quot;

buyers in Pri@@ mark outra@@ ged on women who are in the middle of business under@@ wear under@@ wear
&quot; the buyers did not know where to see , as a woman pulled her clothes in the midst of a prim@@ mark to try under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , they numbered , as she saw in it , she moved out and laid them back into the shelf . &quot;
she moved on and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
&quot; the Pri@@ mark shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where women tried the under@@ pants before they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was at the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman had under@@ wear the under@@ wear , &quot; she moved back and left the store without buying anything . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw .
&quot; in the middle of the sales surface , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the exhaust , moved their own strings and pants and tried them . &quot;
she didn &apos;t even tried to find a more discreet place to do it - she simply stood there as o@@ sk@@ ar .
&quot; each star@@ ed when she moved out the under@@ pants , which you obviously cannot please , as they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same with three further under@@ pants before she finally decided that you did nothing , again and left . &quot;
they did not seem to distur@@ b that they observed someone - or about the person who would like to buy the under@@ pants they had tried .
&quot; MS Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; how contradictory to think that someone would take shelter with home that had a different person and which were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; MS Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; as I have participated , the staff tried to draw the garments on sale after it went - what &apos;s just as good . &quot;
&quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants , and find out that another woman had her and returned , and they were not washed . &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a in front of weapons
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make him more secure for you . &quot;
&quot; we spoke with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ der in New York to find out how to switch to armed predat@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; whether you are approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how you turn the sp@@ ind@@ le for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; if one crosses you from behind , then you should turn out to be the first , so that you can see your att@@ acker and embark on the line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
grab the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit it with your free el@@ bows .
&quot; then hit him with the knee into the lead and turn , while the aggres@@ sors before pains collap@@ ses , the weapon from his hands . hit it with the run into the face and move back , while they turn the weapon onto it . &quot;
&quot; at att@@ ackers , which approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the line , grab the weapon and rot@@ ate them , so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; shift the weight on the gun at the same time , and hit the chest to the chest , then turn the gun from its grip before they move back@@ wards and set the weapon to it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly what it does Miz@@ ra@@ chi preference .
&quot; however , remember that it is most secure when smoking is most secure - if you are not a Kra@@ V Mag@@ a Grand@@ master . &quot;
travel@@ er Ian Wright comple@@ tes his tongue for a travel guide to the dirty places of Europe
a British travel@@ er under@@ went his immune system and wor@@ ger@@ ef@@ lex of a serious examination - by putting some of the dirty and most important places in Europe .
&quot; the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k shr@@ ank his course on a Euro shooter , a rail@@ ing on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a flush kno@@ b of a migr@@ ating force , and a public telephone in Russia to proof the resili@@ ence of its immune system . &quot;
&quot; before leaving every object , he used a l@@ umin@@ ometer to prove himself and to show us what he is going to get involved . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was recorded under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results in day@@ light . &quot;
&quot; the thought , the ins@@ ing kno@@ b of a tractor toi@@ lette blade , which has already been used by thousands of others , but actually are in a kitchen sink more bad bacteria . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright with doctors and medical professionals spoke about the promotion of bo@@ wel bacteria and his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left what he saw , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Wright has been known to test the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ines , traveled by the world and ate peculiar things as well as wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public funds to train stations to flush up to sink , the task set up his immune system definitely under a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he told : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot;
in the film he was justified to his reputation in any case .
&quot; the only thing he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia . &quot;
its prob@@ ation line showed a l@@ umin@@ ous number of over 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter number is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian res@@ tro@@ om who refused to aver@@ t , after their lo@@ umin@@ ous count was over 4000 units , while freshly harvested hands was one of less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel guides &apos; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number at different places such as the bathroom &quot;
&quot; he says , &quot; &quot; This is coming to the worst what I have in a toilet , near . &quot;
there is nothing bad for it than that !
&quot; I will not try here , because it is ru@@ dd@@ ly here . &quot;
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company sha@@ ded Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which includes both dairy bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of bo@@ wel bacteria and the immune system . &quot;
&quot; Vali@@ os Senior Vice President for snacks , juices and New categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explain the advantages of probiot@@ ics .
&quot; we brought crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings by , which ended with it that we said &quot; L@@ ass us Ian &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking just about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily area , the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide the consumer more information in an interesting manner .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the director of the film , added : &quot; let me tell me that - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had told some of the things I have reli@@ ed on him , such as the ek@@ el@@ ty Russian toilet that is shown in the movie . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to it and others where this was quite difficult . &quot;
&quot; I am glad , that we have recorded some of these dirty goodies to film . &quot;
&quot; in one of Vali@@ o conducted survey conducted by 2015 by 84 percent of all surve@@ yed dairy bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine , and 58 percent said that they are at least occasionally products to use the sp@@ ind@@ le l@@ actic acid bacteria . &quot;
A@@ social family destroyed Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ing social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; a as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left their social @-@ apartment after a del@@ o@@ ction with a damage of £ 50,000 because they had terror@@ ises their neighbours . &quot;
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in S@@ alt@@ ash . Corn@@ wall .
&quot; after they were rolled out from their property , the property co@@ oper@@ atives found the property in an irre@@ par@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls made miserable holes on , wooden di@@ ties were ri@@ pped up , rub@@ b@@ ish was disper@@ sed in the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was put to the walls . &quot;
the family have been embr@@ aced and it is assumed that she is now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy who works for the house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing said that she was afraid that the apartment is no longer to be repaired .
she said : &quot; it was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
&quot; there are many things to consider , as this property will probably be considered as a beautiful part of Corn@@ wall . &quot;
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police told that the terror which had attached the family , street fights with bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ots , fri@@ ghtening of residents , drug abuse , drug abuse , and excessive scre@@ ams , streams and floods . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which will be demol@@ ished under circumstances , old trash was found . &quot;
&quot; there have been in the property , in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wood@@ di@@ elen . &quot;
neighbours said that they saw them fighting on the streets and regularly had to be called the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ gi@@ ed her and her partner this week rolled by the property after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to voluntary surrender .
Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors saying that her life was made to hell .
&quot; one said : &quot; &quot; they turned out about anyone . &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
&quot; the countless times , which we say the police here are incredible . &quot;
&quot; today , we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - that we are not used !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will become beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Adam Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would deny the family to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , where the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years long . &quot;
on the over@@ flowing side of the municipal house were rub@@ b@@ ish rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys .
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that it is the r@@ enter to accept all responsibility for their behavior and family , as a del@@ usion is always the last step to take into Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot;
this was a very difficult case since the behaviour was extremely difficult and their actions to be horrible for their neighbours .
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the church who are brave to us and have provided us with the information . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will resume some neighbors and gives the message that anti @-@ social behaviour is not toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;
&quot; fil@@ thy mattress , located in one of the bedrooms of the house after Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation on the ground . &quot;
workers of the household management will now have to be garbage mountains that surround the house
&quot; in 2014 the police conducted a raid on the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ nia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ e received a penalty after they had found guilty of the owner of a drug of class B in trade view .
&quot; she said that money for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don was , which came to life in 2013 at an automobile accident . &quot;
&quot; after they were without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many rooms of the house were programmed with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police also says that they will enter a ten@@ ant who do not abide by the house@@ order
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall shared with that the dolphins are a clear warning to the other tenants which do not comply with the house@@ order .
&quot; this goes to those who think they may be able to behave without self @-@ accus@@ ation , as well as those who were damaged by such a behavior . &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

&quot; in this way , the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam won the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and just Olympia . &quot;
brass went to Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zi@@ ani .
the two Chinese got it as expected in the end@@ game and made the title among each other .
this was clear that for the third time a Chinese would pick up the single title in the sign of the five rings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympia podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sets and in time @-@ outs , they had no co@@ aches in itself . &quot;
they had withdrawn on the tri@@ b@@ une and left their sho@@ ots in fair competition alone together .
&quot; the Mat@@ ches , up to here I have played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the finale I play for me , &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang tor@@ ily said . &quot;
after the parti@@ san gold and silver med@@ all@@ ists with the China @-@ Flag .
the match itself was unexpected .
Ma had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first sentence .
&quot; after that , he set the pace with the record and left Z@@ hang down there only a total of 13 points . &quot;
by the superiority of Ma did not develop the expected @-@ awaited match .

Donald Tr@@ ump bur@@ t ″ tremendous problems ″ in the campaign &apos;s campaign
&quot; the leadership of the U.S. Republi@@ can is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive worries , even in traditionally conservative federal states their majority . &quot;
&quot; at Donald Tr@@ ump , Donald Tr@@ ump gave weaknesses of his electoral campaign in the previous Republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg Utah . &quot;
&quot; a rare moment , in which the usually wholesale and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire has expressed something like concerns about how correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the own Republi@@ can camp from the race , the doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are now growing . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump from evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for support in important federal states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; blame were false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media appearances . &quot;
republi@@ can high bur@@ sts w@@ ack@@ les
Utah is normally a safe bank for re@@ public@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey of Sur@@ ve@@ y@@ USA from June , Tr@@ ump and his bankruptcy of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , &quot;
&quot; other institutions see Tr@@ ump in front , but not by the distance that are common to Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state . &quot;
&quot; at risk , Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered also in Arizona and Georgia . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with the Senate CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump rep@@ lied to the question as he wants to stop the rise of Clin@@ t : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; and whether back : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he is doing nothing else than to tell the truth .
&quot; if it is not rich for him in the end of the reasons of the political correctness , it is fine , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the party should be threatened to submit funds to support his election campaigns , he should not be able to present any better conversion values . &quot;
&quot; instead of accepting the candidates of re@@ public@@ ans for the Congress more strongly , under the arms . &quot;
Olympia : Dre@@ ams scam at D@@ oping @-@ Test
the IO@@ C wants to establish a disciplinary commission .
Ken@@ y@@ as Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ ten is threatened with the second D@@ oping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; after a beg@@ inner look at a D@@ oping control in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a coach to the home . &quot;
&quot; the International Olympic Committee shared with , immediately set up a disciplinary Commission to investigate the case . &quot;
&quot; a ken@@ i@@ an@@ ese function@@ ary had told that the former Spr@@ inter and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village , had a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ meter L@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i . &quot;
this was the team leader K@@ eni@@ as has been reported by the D@@ oping controllers .
&quot; the International Association of IA@@ AF has requested the IO@@ C for information about the case , in order to strict own investigations , shared a IA@@ AF spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make a rating &quot; , &quot; it was called a IA@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the D@@ oping control station and turned out to be F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ er , the trial was released and signed , &quot; said K@@ eni@@ as Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p SO@@ I . &quot;
&quot; he was in possession of ac@@ creditation of athletes , who stood on the list for training controls of the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency . &quot;
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was in Beijing World Cup @-@ Vi@@ ased about 800 meters .
four days before was the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics Deleg@@ ations Michael Rot@@ er have been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Olympics .
he should be informed against money payments for his country over the upcoming D@@ oping tests .
&quot; according to media reports , he was said to be arrested by Nairobi at his return to the Nairobi airport . &quot;
Kenya is already under a special observation when IO@@ C has been under a special observation at the IO@@ C .
&quot; in the announcement of the IO@@ C submitted by the IO@@ C more than 2000 D@@ oping target controls before the Rio Olympics , previously pointed out that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into sight . &quot;
&quot; the world &apos;s Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had put pressure on the African country in front of the summer , an anti @-@ D@@ oping law and a functioning control system . &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics .
&quot; in the episode , the W@@ ada Kenya took from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing fight against the rules of the W@@ ada . &quot;
Kenya is considered a great runner nation .
most of the medals of the country won the most medals in Beijing on the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
in a series of television reports the ARD were repeatedly raised that in Kenya D@@ oping means are easily accessible and there should be a considerable mentality of the athle@@ te .
&quot; IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und asked for a similar investigation into Kenya , as he had placed them in the Russian athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; thereby , it could be proven that in this sport @-@ type and systematically del@@ etes . &quot;
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics were then excluded from the summer of summer .
Salzburg &apos;s West Side Story &quot; with Cecilia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ Year , the Salzburg Festival plays the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with this a surprising Cecilia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; one musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of Classi@@ cal and filled with the role of Mary a teen@@ ager .
&quot; in orchestr@@ al , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra conducted Gust@@ avo Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ med . &quot;
we always say that she is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have some music in our blood !
in this staging Bart@@ oli plays a col@@ lo@@ at Maria .
she recalls with melanchol@@ y to her favorite with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances . &quot;
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
first of all because it is musi@@ cally special !
and then there would be Mari@@ an personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
&quot; so it is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; she resembles me very much , my Italian character I used as a redness , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the Opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour to work with her .
it is an indispensable man .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment back : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and passionate ! &quot;
gas@@ p is a necessity for him .
&quot; you see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip World Cup . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley , the &quot; West Side Story &quot; is up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; in this piece , it is about prejudices and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have walked the refugees , at that time the Puer@@ t@@ ori@@ ans have gone to New York and the New York City did not want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same themes , and they are just as meaningful as they are at that time . &quot;
59 years later the piece is still relevant .
&quot; London School of London , who joined the IS , was killed in Syria &quot;
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za S@@ UL@@ T@@ ANA , one of three British school cities , left in London to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that her family learned a few weeks from her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria . &quot;
&quot; it was thought that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ wark of the group in the country , reported I@@ TV news on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; S@@ UL@@ T@@ ANA was 17 years old and died shortly after her family after she had imagined , the war@@ ped country to leave and to return to England . &quot;
&quot; we can only hope that the only good therein lies - as reminder and warning to others , that these are the risks associated with , to go into a war area - people from being able to ever make this decision , &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , S@@ UL@@ T@@ ANA and two other school species from the east of London moved to a plane in the direction of Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ tan@@ as family was told that she mar@@ ries a ISIS comb@@ at@@ ants in Syria , and within a few months was a widow . &quot;

Turkey : Kurdish church counting on mass evasion
&quot; whoever does not fit and Erdogan sits , sits on packed caffeine , &quot; says the chief of the Gü@@ len @-@ Foundation Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in short notice , the Kurdish municipality of Germany is counting on the short @-@ term with tens of thousands of preser@@ ves from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term , it could even become &quot; &quot; some hundreds of thousands &quot; , &quot; the association &apos;s leader believes Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; because of the hard work of the Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdogan after the coup , the Kurdish municipality of Germany expect a mass strike to Germany . &quot;
&quot; at the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands of thousands and thousands of thousands who oppose the Erdogan &apos;s minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government already passed away Kurdish strongh@@ olds with imp@@ acting , be 500,000 Kurds in Turkey on the run . &quot;
after the dis@@ missed coup are still secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks .
many will begin to start in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that takes place refugees , produced in the own country of refugees , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the association was accused of targeted acts of Syrian Arab in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
in this way Erdogan wants to increase the emigr@@ ation to the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were wi@@ ped out or exp@@ elled in the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also CD@@ U member . &quot;
&quot; the association called for the Federal Government , positioned itself as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters . &quot;
also in Germany I find a &quot; wit@@ ch@@ asing &quot; against Erdogan &apos;s critics .
in recent months I won &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len Movement had also feared the flight of many Turks .
&quot; more Turks will look for asylum in Germany , especially for Kurds and opposition . &quot;
the Brand@@ marking as Gü@@ len @-@ followers destro@@ ys teachers and other academics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not fit and Erdogan sits , sits on packed bags , by the way also the Kem@@ alist and sa@@ kul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ Foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the papers reported by calling on figures from the Federal Ministry of Commerce , the Turks had already reported the largest group of asylum seekers in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; as a result of June 30 , this has been 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people and therefore almost 29 per cent of all accepted as asylum accepted ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , not those of war , poverty or fu@@ tility cannot be found . &quot;
&quot; asylum seekers according to the Basic Law are only politically , i.e. from the state side , individually Ver@@ followed . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; to go where it hur@@ ts
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the natives receive nothing from the summer campaign with - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from Nor@@ dr@@ h@@ ein @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia must not choose the country day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
the country @-@ day selection will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
for stupid as far as so far it does not go : summer holidays , heat and tag@@ tag@@ ging fighting - that is attached . &quot;
the natives that are to be convinced by the fighters are on vacation .
&quot; most of the tourists who are in the land , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so they are not allowed to choose the land day . &quot;
&quot; practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , the posters , bub@@ bles , bub@@ bles , fl@@ yers and end up voices are en@@ umer@@ ated , just lab@@ eling . &quot;
&quot; until 4 September 2016 , the electoral and last Feri@@ a day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to go over by the people in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , when one can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U Coalition , must be afraid of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , since 1998 the strongest party , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
exciting is how strong new@@ com@@ ing Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ ases .
&quot; S@@ ella , 66 years old and since 2008 Leader , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign , one sees from his major acc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the country , spread ro@@ ses and ch@@ atting a little with the people , as it also did his legendary @-@ silk predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , past@@ oral past@@ ors have received cold feet , and chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel &apos;s blame on the flowering of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; your refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; have accelerated the rise of right @-@ wing popul@@ ists , which will probably cost him the beautiful office . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with their prime candidate , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make the wrong time at the right place of election . &quot;
it has invited twice the chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to showcase ; Merkel Bundest@@ ag@@ sw@@ am is located in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s a pity also to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the nor@@ theastern CD@@ U is largely based on the usual voting distances on market grounds and mainly shopping m@@ alls with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; that , so co@@ ined , play only a &quot; minor role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the union also noted that in the country you must cut off the base , that it must be very difficult to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; you are about as the left , the SPD , the Green : in the times of the country barely any . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U Elec@@ tives Kok@@ ert is self @-@ exposed : &quot; they must go there where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party needs to be used . &quot;
&quot; because a lot has been on the game , cel@@ ering has now called its SPD to a particularly committed election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , Socialists and Democrats last last with 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and only just outside the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
in the election of 2011 the SPD had still made clear with 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
&quot; the Greens , small party with seven percent in the pol@@ ls , should create the leap into the country day . &quot;
they make a modern virtue of the holidays @-@ Not a modern virtue and reloc@@ ate their election campaign into the internet .
&quot; online @-@ election campaign , &quot; is called the State Chairman of Claudia Müller . &quot;
otherwise green electoral fighters on trace search for native stimul@@ i among the tourists .
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the leading can@@ did@@ acy , cur@@ v@@ t just with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ sburg lakes and finds it also beautiful . &quot;
their impression : &quot; Leg@@ nick@@ a in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabilitation : guests suffer from block@@ age
&quot; speed , with which the B 27 re@@ treats , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; for the persons responsible for construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 am and end up until 20 p.m. , there are all praise . &quot;
&quot; they have done everything fairly well , &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff of the Jet @-@ Gas station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no escape .
&quot; the construction site could be transferred to the South at the end of October , until the end of October it will be ready . &quot;
&quot; blessed will also be the dischar@@ ging of the works responsible for construction , e.g. when it comes to the establishment of containers . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site on Monday to the south , the block of the asphalt road in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was suspended and the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is also relaxed , the traffic situation is relaxed within the place . &quot;
the citizens can now proceed from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 again .
smo@@ other traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were partly significant complaints , &quot; &quot; says the Vice @-@ related management of the rehabilitation officer of Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of Bach@@ er@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , o@@ fold street and past@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many Sch@@ leich@@ wege sought and more likely to trust their Nav@@ i as the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to man@@ oeu@@ vre trucks in residential areas .
&quot; since the speed of speed is not respected , the community is strengthening the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable exceed@@ ance , &quot; says King , who made himself a place about the situation . &quot;
there have been two to three per minute un@@ lit@@ tered .
the fastest was on the road with 77 hours per hour at the pace @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site moved , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
&quot; for the business@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that is now open to customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg . &quot;
business@@ men do not like to look into the maps .
&quot; but that the B 27 @-@ refurb@@ ishment has led to sales to sales , each one that is asked to look at . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some are less affected . &quot;
&quot; those who have to do with the &quot; end customers &quot; means less , so for other companies , the refurb@@ ishment has no consequences . &quot;
&quot; also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; maximum drop &quot; , &quot; but also a fact that of course is missing . &quot;
the most strongly exploited are the Local along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds significant words . &quot;
this is exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the facilities have made it hard . &quot;
&quot; we were missing the customers from He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil . &quot;
we need to be happy with each Euro turnover .
&quot; in addition , the sales revenue can be reached on &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the streets of road have thrown its operation &quot; by two years . &quot;
half of his employees have to be released .
&quot; if I had a company with 4,000 employees and half of them had been dis@@ missed , politics would have responded differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt has on a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be a financial compensation , with the indication , the hosts benefited otherwise from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now they are also the disadvantages that carry out through the renovation . &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where so a gener@@ ously managed .
with all the pl@@ agues G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that its hospitality will continue .
&quot; after all , the family business has been settled since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars are now less common because of complicated traffic management , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you cannot drive down , it is also very different . &quot;
&quot; that his stem cli@@ ent@@ el returns to the end of the restoration work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises of BS@@ E and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 construction work on his cli@@ ent@@ ele for the greatest crisis which has experienced its restaurant in its long @-@ standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months of work , this is brutal . &quot;
&quot; constantly , in the name of the terrorist fight against laws . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks , Interior de Mai@@ zi@@ ère lays now a thick security package . &quot;
but what has a reason to do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ er say to all of that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; all his proposals are &quot; politically reasonable , &quot; says the Federal Minister at the presentation of his new safety package . &quot;
you don &apos;t want anyone .
&quot; others , further points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , I am participating . &quot;
&quot; but as an Interior Minister , he was located at the results and at a &quot; &quot; for@@ ged consensus &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach , during the recent attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach presented a little time before he presents his conclusions for the safety of the Republic . &quot;
but the more extensive are the more extensive .
&quot; a lot has already been announced , announced that a new security authority is to take care of the b@@ aking encrypted communication , is not new . &quot;
it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU directives to air passengers and weapons .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for safety authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second startup for suggestions that had not been made with the SPD : he wants sympath@@ ise for the terrorist groups under punishment and to crack jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; Dep@@ t of the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is still reasonable for reasonable and demanding nothing , which in the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ists do not have any chance . &quot;
a few new ideas presents de Mai@@ zi@@ ère as well .
they have partly in themselves : it plans for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for the imprisonment of people from deportation to deportation .
refugees who are targeted to the country have to check @-@ in before their smartphones and disclose social @-@ media account for a security check .
&quot; for exp@@ ired asylum seekers , he wants to make some worse still worse than so far - such that commit crimes or their papers are aware of their identity . &quot;
some of them is political and legal .
maneu@@ vers also acts un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally and leaves questions openly .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of cr@@ ush for example - the question arises : what does this have to do with security and terror ?
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror . &quot;
&quot; but it does not allow himself to speak , that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Wür@@ zburg were refugees . &quot;
&quot; in addition , many people face the high level of refugees to worry about security . &quot;
&quot; and things that deeply employed people , they did not let go out in election times even in election times . &quot;
the inner security is far advanced in the focus .
&quot; only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach .
uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are election fights . &quot;
the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly moving towards internal security in terms of internal security .
in the past few days between the two parties went high .
&quot; only a gar@@ dener dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior , in which the res@@ ellers also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a return from double citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also here of irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
&quot; from a return from the double pass , he kept nothing . &quot;
we have tried the discussion in Germany .
&quot; to do new , be not useful . &quot;
and with a Bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional concerns .
&quot; whether his own package is constitu@@ tive on all corners , and whether it is &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ zer partner , it is necessary to show itself . &quot;
there is a lot of things that could provide for war .
&quot; however , the SPD is currently trying to profile yourself in the issue of internal security . &quot;
&quot; Secretary of Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alizes carefully at once again and says : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security further . &quot;
still comes Volkswagen glimp@@ ses through .
&quot; despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the supply of suppliers rise around the world . &quot;
but not in all markets it runs around .
in the return tion there is a vor@@ tex to one term .
Volkswagen starts the ship@@ ments in the second half of the year .
&quot; in the previous year , Europe &apos;s largest car@@ makers can continue to advance a plus in the previous year , despite its many brands and some well @-@ moving markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July the core brand was weak@@ ened primarily in Western Europe , and therefore res@@ sed the total sales , as described in the D@@ ax company . &quot;
&quot; worldwide , the VW brand sold with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars to 1.8 percent less than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , to China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in the home market , the deliveries around almost an sixth of the country . &quot;
&quot; Prime Minister Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker numbers from July , especially on two selling days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there have been a department res@@ tra@@ int in some core markets by the &quot; changing economic framework . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup in Turkey , British vote also has been deb@@ ated by the EU to res@@ ignation the EU , explained a spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; in the U.S. , where the car@@ bure@@ tor was first escal@@ ated , there is also a minus to Bu@@ che . &quot;
large St@@ ones for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; all in all , the mainly affected area of the Lower Saxony through the diesel scandal : after the first seven months , there is merely an output minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles to Bu@@ che . &quot;
consolidated CEO Fred Kap@@ pler could continue to be a sales spl@@ us from January to July .
&quot; 1,3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen in this period , worldwide 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had tam@@ pered with a software subscription .
alone in Germany , VW is calling about 2.5 million cars to upgrade to the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of re@@ armament , VW , that the reconstruction of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after re@@ armament of the vehicles , there are no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ makers make the client after re@@ armament a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was meant by Friday in business trips . &quot;
reason are legal intri@@ c@@ acies .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported Volkswagen includes its German customers now a guarantee of rounded diesel models .
this confirmed the last Monday VW representative in the Federal Department of Justice .
the Federal Ministry was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has to comply with the requirements of my investigation Commission and the KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from this will not be accepted , &quot; stated Federal Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power after re@@ armament do not take place , and all type @-@ approved vehicle values remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; but not as it was meant by company travel . &quot;
&quot; the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; allows Volkswagen to see that customers come back for example a half year after re@@ armament into a workshop - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; also , in the customer interest , it is important to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the outra@@ geous state of uncertainty as it meant . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW uses the term &quot; guarantee . &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund on the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from sufficient austerity demands in the future as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; bank Director Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who can park 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily accounts . &quot;
&quot; the German association of German banks talks about a single case , and does not see a signal : &quot; &quot; normal austerity &quot; &quot; would not be afraid to pay for their as@@ parag@@ on pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; bearings banks cash on night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay its 0.@@ 4 percent criminal law . &quot;
&quot; this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private , and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 euros on gyp@@ sum or daily accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 Euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 cost 400 euros in the year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
it has been 40 million euros which could be withdrawn from one day to another and which he could not fail .
&quot; they are lying with me on the central bank account and cause a 0.@@ 4 percent cost , &quot; &quot; said the banker . &quot;
I cannot put a million euros for every one million Euro .
the cost he shall continue after the poll@@ uter @-@ pays principle .
&quot; the cash simply lie in the Tres@@ ors of the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; &quot; I have already experienced four over @-@ cases , I don &apos;t even sleep the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers have an understanding and mis@@ impact on other investment forms .
only few migr@@ ated to other banks .
&quot; the cooperative association of Bavaria said : &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes considerable costs at all banks . &quot;
&quot; to wear alone , &quot; &quot; commercially viable is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have their charges for bank account , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
&quot; with pen@@ alties for deposits , from three million euros , the Thur@@ in@@ gian People and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had made headlines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank stores in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , main business leaders of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay a nationwide compensation for deposits , the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks need to be much too strong . &quot;
&quot; a banker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , I give it &quot; a cliff that is equipped with a little lush property . &quot;
this can become a problem for a small bank if they are free money .
&quot; the cooperative based cooperative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ ers , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; in the region well known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live . &quot;
&quot; the cooperative association of Bavaria &quot; is currently not known for any further banks , which calculate an exchange rate for deposits of private customers , &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot;
&quot; Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich ( B@@ v@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , explained at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into negative towards private customers is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; the competition is hard , and it dro@@ us the migration of investors to the competition . &quot;
the customers in Germany will not be noticed in the width .
destination plates : who actually buys sound boards ?
lonely men middle ages love plates .
&quot; before you head to the comment@@ ator , to so@@ w him under the alias of non @-@ aging men with rough insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the promised re@@ genesis of sound plates do not want to be on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that wish to welcome the re@@ alism of physical objects , but on Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who have recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght after the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyers .
it is also not a hor@@ des caused by hob@@ bies - it has an emotional meaning : older records retain their feelings more likely ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoying it alone time to spend ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do you agree with the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on television , I would follow the camera while in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o drive , a modest grey starter , and wild@@ est , before I ste@@ al , my hands hold and something determining how : &quot; so , let us take a closer look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let us take a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even if the heart of so@@ hos is slowly rede@@ emed at its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sellers are located - still there are a handful of records . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman the camera to turn off for the next part , where I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops , trying to assess their age and minds through observation . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I came from S@@ ister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle ages ) to the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle ages , a woman , probably about the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
is he a collector I ask ?
&quot; I already appreciate &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records . &quot;
&quot; these record plates , shown above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I &apos;m not followed at home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : it is now able to buy plates that he could not afford , when they appeared , and again items that he sold , when he was young and ple@@ xed . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70 &apos;s who appeared , when I was 11 or 12 . things in which I was supposed to have something too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy plates , more intro@@ ver@@ ted and gladly spend time , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I drink not much . &quot;
this is my L@@ aster .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers meet , which he meets on the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; he has also noticed a new wave of people who have heard about the com@@ eback , people who have heard about the com@@ eback , and caused to be able to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; of the conversations that I have led , people usually get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , sell now their CDs to get their records back , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of a certain age of age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to recognize that record stores offers a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to the WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar sound @-@ atten@@ s , of objects , the bl@@ iss@@ ful ju@@ gen@@ itals . &quot;
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of sol@@ ation , &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot;
this is the case with me as collectors and I think it is so many people .
it &apos;s a simple way to get mentally .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; fl@@ utes a staff of a record @-@ pile .
&quot; a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of the people who bought a record last month , they have not yet been heard . &quot;
&quot; the survey took place also that 41 % have a record player , which they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a plate , don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably look very concerned while taking a stack at Bos@@ sa Nova Comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works in sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men middle @-@ age ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ val . &quot;
&quot; someone came only recently here and said , &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead record , so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a great percentage , but it is definitely happening . &quot;
&quot; more br@@ ittle , less musicians . &quot;
&quot; we have people , who say , &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older , who come slowly . &quot;
&quot; stop@@ over , which has dedicated the record @-@ plates almost a whole floor , has a colorful audience when I go . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourist , the photos do , teen@@ ager and women aged men . &quot;
&quot; even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above @-@ standing shops , Wild Be@@ ast New synthes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ ated pop instead of experimental jazz sa@@ iled from the loud@@ speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among the customers . &quot;
&quot; none of them can be curious , but wet psychological trau@@ mas are hard to be det@@ ectable if one stands next to someone 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for several minutes and considers the variation of the plates available for sale . &quot;
it is more likely to buy a shop @-@ w@@ af@@ ers as a major purchase .
&quot; it does not deserve much , so collecting plates is not a real option , says it . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives with a loved si@@ gh . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
&quot; my last stop is a shop , which is said that a new generation of record @-@ lovers have to be inspired : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; as I give the semb@@ lance to mu@@ te the jeans Hot@@ ies , I watched a group of young teen@@ ager before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a cros@@ ley record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left you can find a staircase , a wall full of panels of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody looks at it - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to put them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; considering that any attraction for these objects might mean more money for the industry , and some customers could send in the depths of so@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , the one that is most for luxury objects such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even though my research inquiries made that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they leave , at least in record business in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record @-@ owner who exist in reality , record business and in Online@@ . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the um@@ meln of the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while they ste@@ er the rigid view of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year false moder@@ ator , who rises over the shoulders of the middle aged men . &quot;

&quot; during a court proceedings this week argued the authorities in Cal@@ ais that the State should be authorised to sell 72 Pro@@ visional stores in which persons within the camp goods , sell , hair@@ dressing services , or tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the Pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places should be s@@ worn down , because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid and that s@@ lash a fire@@ wall and san@@ ity risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals are offered by the stat@@ eless association and other groups , not enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also led out that the provisional stores and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the assignment of people who operate the 72 Pro@@ visional stores , but sp@@ ake that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais are absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François Mol@@ la said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants play a much bigger role than those who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of quiet meeting will provide for refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the decline was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos;s Café des camp , the collaborative and French @-@ classes as well as advice on asylum purposes for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
more than 170@@ .000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; café .
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian it was , that the closure &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
&quot; the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Migr@@ ants were cher@@ ished on Friday that the number of people rose on over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of new arrivals over the course of the summer . &quot;
despite Olympia disappointment : Martin remains fran@@ fer@@ ous
&quot; in spite of his disappointing show in the olymp@@ ic time , Rad@@ prof@@ i Tony Martin does not want to under@@ mine Tony Martin . &quot;
&quot; I keep on the World Cup at a glance , remain confident and fights , &quot; wrote the 31 year old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot;
a statement for his miserable twel@@ fth place at the Zu@@ ck@@ erh@@ ut he does not have .
&quot; to me it is sincere , it is difficult to comment the time of yesterday , &quot; said Martin . &quot;
he must analyse and analyse the reasons for the deb@@ acle .
Martin actually wanted to fight for the title in Qatar in October in Qatar .
I &apos;ll see everything exactly what we changed in the last time .
&quot; this also includes my position , &quot; wrote the three @-@ ali@@ zer time world champion which had lost on Wednesday at 5@@ 4.5 km more than three minutes at the Olympi@@ ad Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany Ras@@ er is required to adjust to the next generation of speed measurement : in different federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new leaf@@ lets are tested , which are to be particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic acting En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example by accident points , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway building or to sandy bridges with temporary c@@ ots , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary leaf@@ let for keeping the speed limit . &quot;
a lasting mobile building can however be too dangerous or costly .
&quot; the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery holds five days , the case data is encrypted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser @-@ measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded via several tracks at the same time . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limit as well as the way to time , chassis and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
in high @-@ prop@@ elled condition you can move the trailer according to manufacturer with each car with a tag @-@ cl@@ utch .
&quot; that he is not simply cl@@ oned , it is lowered by the measuring operation , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also sli@@ pped out @-@ out out@@ breaks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should be protected against v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer for data from Vit@@ ronic has been tested in various federal countries since 2015 and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also flas@@ hes with the new technique : rejuven@@ ate France 100 pieces of Georgian , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
Britain wins silver in the 7 @-@ year Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class gold wins
&quot; the impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came in the finals on Thursday evening to a rup@@ ting stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were beaten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the i@@ col stage here in Rio . &quot;
&quot; fi@@ ji divided a master class in handling , side @-@ stepping , post @-@ ups and ro@@ her strength to win gold - their first Olympi@@ ad medal of any color . &quot;
&quot; defeat was failed by the not too bad tro@@ phy of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could certainly be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they proposed New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals on the same day could fall back to them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but whatever , Fi@@ ji would have taken a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in the form of a 15 @-@ man team . &quot;
it could be a sol@@ ace for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a br@@ ite tomorrow a gold medal is to hang on his neck : fi@@ j@@ is Chef Ben Ryan , the former chef for England from Wimbledon . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind them .
&quot; eight years ago , she lost every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens . &quot;
here they lost only one .
&quot; this sli@@ der will do , but the progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and left the attacks GB@@ s from fun .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitch@@ ell and Co. in , as if one would walk in driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with even four minutes playing time , Jerry Tu@@ wai has another attack from the right corner , which he turned . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely left the ball .
&quot; a prepar@@ atory res@@ ignation of Mitch@@ ell , stopped the mountain of man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third gate to achieve , but it has only stopped fi@@ ji . &quot;
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right corner a touch@@ down and there stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ p@@ p@@ ff and there was still about a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pressed by further weak b@@ umps of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion took a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
&quot; it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while UK still wi@@ red . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB led fundamental changes to half @-@ time by and closed the fi@@ ji@@ anic gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was running long in favor of the Süd@@ se@@ ein@@ sul@@ aner , whose fans sang , flags and danced on the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame set the i @-@ icing on a further attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; the P@@ fi@@ ff , the fi@@ j@@ is embr@@ aced and the GB ki@@ cked crus@@ hing in the lawn . &quot;
&quot; formerly on the day , Fi@@ ji Japan had conquered in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and the UK forced South Africa in a scarce half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ k in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored one gate among the post in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant L@@ ackl@@ ing of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ Benz team , secured the profit - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the trainer
there will be no em@@ ot@@ in@@ aler@@ ted gold than in these games and that wants to be called .
&quot; from the first rowing envelope to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve , who go down in history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even though it was only those who were sitting at the end of the boat , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams , was omni@@ present as she rested on the second Olympi@@ ad in two without tax woman in a row , the first women in the history of the British sport that were on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their dominance was absolutely , after all their 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ damaged use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ ins , who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ges , which is not the way of the triumph of it ge@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in the rowing , a batt@@ ali@@ on are contributing to the incre@@ mental advances which make the difference and there was nobody any more f@@ eit than the trainer who would not survive the day before 30 months ago , when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he was risky . &quot;
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and they did it .
&quot; if you do not do it , he spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a quite bad situation .
it changed a little bit of the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio were lucky that he could be treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , could start what the break was to a minimum if that under such circumstances is the correct term . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better again soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; rowing in itself is a challenge , but that makes it a bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the im@@ medi@@ ability of the victory , their first thought of Williams , who spent a ner@@ ven@@ ing morning thus spent something more than usual and tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , who was as captain in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . that &apos;s maybe something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it is repeated , how much I mean , how much I and Helen and Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be no one , therefore a massive thanks to him . he is the best trainer in the world . &quot;
I could not have wished for a better person or desire a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark have started up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot in reserve . &quot;
we were very imprisoned at the moment .
&quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , remain in the process . &quot;
it really is important to not get involved .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not able to do anything Tol@@ les .
&quot; we wanted no fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we also did . &quot;
the pair will take a time for one year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver has to appear next week at a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
this would have put a lot of pressure .
&quot; in London , it took around six months to understand that I am an Olympic @-@ artist . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; it feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
31 years for clarity for clarity
&quot; the manager of the Aqu@@ arian association &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ group , &quot; R@@ up@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , goes into retirement . &quot;
the association is regarded as &quot; Bav@@ arian exemplary . &quot;
a small fr@@ ame@@ ful drinking water @-@ associated association as a model for the large water producers .
&quot; thus , some time ago in the original design , it was meant to be a part of the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk . &quot;
little later the water forum asked the government of under@@ fran@@ ken the purposes of convenience .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ ed @-@ group &quot; Bav@@ arian @-@ wide as exemplary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , who was in charge of 31 years in the purposes of purpose , was 28 years old as managing director . &quot;
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association with headquarters in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , supports approximately 150@@ ,000 cu@@ bic metres of water and provides 32 places and past@@ ors with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; the municipalities &apos; communities are lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ der , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ah . &quot;
for further towns and villages there are water supply agreements .
&quot; the current president , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Civil in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler 1985 was appointed as a water bank and has been appointed Managing Director of the purpose . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and extended by the water conduc@@ tion and maintenance operations , household planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; outstanding events called them the start @-@ up and initiation of the new fountains ( 1994 ) , plot acquisitions in the area of the new well ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the re@@ purchase of the high @-@ container ( 2004 ) , the re@@ purchase of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the development of water pipes . &quot;
there is no stand@@ still and you have always recorded changes because water lives and drinking water the most important food .
&quot; in her lu@@ d@@ ati@@ o she praised Gö@@ le faithful , reliable and accurate service over 31 years . &quot;
he has used himself with a lot of heart &apos;s blood for his water purpose and he acted to the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
&quot; a few weeks ago , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ ing group to the nit@@ rate group before the water forum of the district underground . &quot;
&quot; for this , he received a great recognition and praise . &quot;
Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler s@@ on the one praised Aqu@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons Greeks who have worked together with him 28 years .
he is the best Aqu@@ wart and he was a loyal kno@@ b .
together we were an unbeatable team .
as highlights from his point of view he posted the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the restructuring of the purpose .
&quot; however , the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the pi@@ er@@ bruch at the high container from Kirch@@ lou@@ der to a 3rd of January . &quot;
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages are supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; also the supply of new brunn , one once can only maintain , because one filled the high container from P@@ ett@@ stadt . &quot;
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ der who joins the successor of Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler .
&quot; the sop@@ rano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko goes open with the au@@ ti@@ stic of her son Ti@@ ago - and moves to other affected parents : &quot; you have to have the courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; the medicine has made great progress , &quot; said 44 @-@ year of the Italian newspaper &quot; Corri@@ ere della Ser@@ a . &quot; &quot;
&quot; having been recognized as the disease in her son , she believed , she had to die . &quot;
&quot; the twenty @-@ year old Ti@@ ago was however well forward and get privately in New York , where there is the best therap@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; to give an example : if I ask him something about what two years ago , when I sang at the Mail@@ änder Scala , he recalls on nothing , &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot;
but he is the happ@@ i@@ est person on earth .
Ti@@ ago comes from Net@@ reb@@ elling connection with the b@@ b@@ b@@ it@@ one Er@@ win Schrot@@ t .

relationship in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ur@@ de - man sho@@ ots on the mate
a 35 @-@ year old man has shot at a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ur@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ur@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner and fatal .
&quot; the man has called himself with us and stated to have shot his companions , &quot; said a pol@@ ze@@ is@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , after him I would be publicly punished . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters large , muscular , brown , brown and has a lat@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the police has released a photo of him . &quot;
it is a few years old .
meanwhile the man is wearing a lat@@ ches .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still bear the weapon in itself so the police .
&quot; who sees Sven S. , is supposed to call the 110 . &quot;
the police speaks of an &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the sacrifice was year 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator 1981 . &quot;
&quot; at first , the responsible police in Lü@@ beck , wanted to make no information on the Ta@@ ther@@ gang or the relationship between offen@@ ders and victims ; but they confirmed that a man had been killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a killing . &quot;
&quot; read@@ more we do not say , &quot; said a pol@@ ze@@ is@@ ance in Lü@@ beck . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses therefore was a special command @-@ command ( SE@@ K ) on the scene .
steel - light @-@ view for the German steel industry
the crum@@ ple and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in million@@ aire .
&quot; financial bur@@ dens resulting from the industry from the cost of oil , are of the table . &quot;
&quot; it remains in the liberation of the Renewable Energi@@ es forming in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Fri@@ ag@@ ape ) . &quot;
I &apos;m really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years .
&quot; the European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask the steel producer , the gases from the ho@@ op to generate electricity for their own consumption . &quot;
the steel industry im@@ min@@ ates the additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year according to the German industry .
&quot; Gabriel said the W@@ AZ , there is now a basic cleaning agreement with the European Commission after talks with competition commission@@ er Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only if the generators are replaced in the steel works , case an EEG @-@ filing of 20 percent . &quot;
but even these will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the European Commission to de@@ hydr@@ ation production .
&quot; thus , the status quo of the previous regulation will largely be fixed . &quot;
special significance have the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel is the future &apos; , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others need to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even in the reform of the emission standards , climate and employment targets are considering &quot; , &quot; IG Metall leader Jörg Hof@@ mann stated in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry has been suffering under over@@ capacity and a substantial prize . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , the situation continues to exac@@ erb@@ ate itself as the world &apos;s largest growing country , in the face of the weak@@ ling domestic demand of mass steel on the world market . &quot;
European manufacturers throw Chinese steel con@@ gru@@ ff price dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring the situation has relaxed .
&quot; on the one hand , import duties on import @-@ st@@ ole effect , for the other hand the economic prospects of China have accumulated in China . &quot;
unclear is how sustainable the re@@ conditioning is needed .
the German industry pri@@ mus Thys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p remained careful on Thursday .
&quot; finally , the prices had more stag@@ nat@@ ing . &quot;
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further costs .
Thys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p I did not least want to exclude some dis@@ closures of individual factories .
&quot; in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel producer remain careful in spite of rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; they produced more than 3.4 million tonnes between six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s figure , such as the economic Association of Steel on Friday . &quot;
after a short increase in May the old crowd went back to each other for the second month .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production is two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association expects an improved order intake in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : singing does &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; S@@ ingen has accompanied UR@@ SE@@ L Ki@@ pp for her whole life : when young girls she was in the school of school , at the mag@@ ister@@ ium study she held the F@@ ach music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir . &quot;
&quot; singing me - emotional and physically , &quot; &quot; describes them . &quot;
&quot; after a sample , it feels balanced , cheerful and overall living , she says . &quot;
&quot; while doing so , she is doing something good for her health and spirit . &quot;
&quot; for singing is just out of several perspectives a great hobby for seniors , Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior league . &quot;
&quot; most seniors sing in chor@@ us and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular meetings , seniors can establish social contacts and cultivate them . &quot;
&quot; because frequently , social and familiar structures arise at the age of age , a choir then is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience also has UR@@ SE@@ L Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and organize themselves , to be able to rely on the other and learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of being . &quot;
&quot; singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
because they exercise a deep and controlled breathing .
&quot; whoever demands his lungs regularly , is not so fast in everyday life from the bust . &quot;
&quot; even though it is about getting the sound of the voice in the age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz of the Federal Labour community of seniors organizations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations the joint singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure , explains it . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often observed that singing or listening of songs with older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often linked to positive feelings of their teen@@ ager . &quot;
through li@@ ed@@ ly@@ te and especially tunes sh@@ attered himself denied people in a long back events .
&quot; in singing , the head also demands a special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
to focus on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
&quot; just older people who live alone , practice so , do not only concentrate on yourself . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through the singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem grows by the singing in the choir .
&quot; to show themselves , If I be long for something , I will get better and watch@@ ful about me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; if anyone wants to try out a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he thinks little talent to have , reveals L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 sin@@ ful people , who sounds there when a sound is beside it ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the suitable offer , seniors have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; sings someone from the familiar circle in a home ench@@ y@@ wheel , you can just connect . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views of cho@@ irs in the area .
who wants to sing in a church choir can turn directly to church or church .
many elderly cho@@ irs can also be found via the Internet .
&quot; who does not have access to the internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask for help with the inter@@ ne@@ tre@@ che . &quot;
&quot; who desire to sing , should join in a choir , betra@@ ying H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
sing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to any age .
cats react sensitive as cr@@ ater on scre@@ ams of the young animals
bi@@ ologists have examined in Hanover the effect of the herd of cat@@ tery on adult animals .
&quot; to her surprise the Mi@@ cks did not let the males go cold , however , they kept in contrast to the females always the same . &quot;
female cats can recognize the arousal level of kittens at the foot of the little ones .
&quot; they are responding to ten percent faster on foli@@ age of kittens , who are in great need , such as scientists from the veterinary University and Medical School Hanover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
&quot; males are also responding to the herds of kittens , but always the same . &quot;
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mixture of less and strongly aroused vir@@ ons for the males either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Con@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; it is first authorized in the study , which was published on this Friday in the mag@@ azin &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kittens have already been distinguished with the urgency of their assistance . &quot;
&quot; observed in total , nine adult K@@ ater and 8 females from the animal @-@ keeping of the MH@@ H . &quot;
you were pre @-@ played for a herd of babies which were taken from the litter box for three minutes and were separated from mother and si@@ blings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of stronger glu@@ ed kittens , which were additionally taken high . &quot;
the researchers consider their results despite the low sample of the test .
&quot; all females , even those who have not yet had their own offspring , re@@ acted to the cry , &quot; said Con@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they turned quicker to the loud@@ speakers if this rep@@ ut@@ ches played the very aroused cas@@ u@@ bi@@ b .
this ability may be be@@ amed or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have responded at all , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already examined many times when people studied the reactions of women and men to baby @-@ no@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; some studies showed that women re@@ acted sensitive to infants , whether they were in mothers or not , reported the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina She@@ um@@ ann . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski is attacking the &quot; gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ sed is in Turkey a football legend .
in Turkey the arrest warrant has been issued against the sti@@ cky foot@@ star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ ses .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , Turkey will once again take place an important football game . &quot;
in front of the Du@@ el of Arch@@ bishop Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line clear : &quot; business as &quot; is announced .
&quot; already in the suspension of the state of emergency after an uprising in July , the government , the everyday life of normal brush should not be affected . &quot;
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup .
it is not always done before the soccer player .
against the former St@@ ark@@ i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ sed the pro@@ secutor &apos;s office put an arrest warrant .
&quot; according to this , the South America has now been living in America , a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
South @-@ kis@@ sing is to be followers of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdogan for the coup .
&quot; true , first of all , this is true for 90 days until October , in fact , in fact , the most Turks living in the lives of most Turks but not as good as any impact . &quot;
the ni@@ ghtly &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; at public places throughout the country Erdogan declared on Wednesday for an end .
the sport is - as the whole country - split into followers and opponents of Erdogan .
especially fans of the club @-@ club are traditionally not counted among the friends of the President .
&quot; but the Gro@@ s of the Turks , however , in the face of dramatic experiences in the story , is the strict rejection of military coup . &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart is strikes for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or sightseeing .
at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala &quot; it will be particularly back to Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski .
&quot; his sports value was demonstrated by the Köl@@ ner in the exp@@ ired season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ year ended its first season as a top@@ sc@@ orer of his association . &quot;
in the end game against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 @-@ seals .
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NAT@@ IK &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy .
&quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; the disappointing season for the record Master found an irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the pre @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League with the &quot; &quot; lion &quot; &quot; also in the Europe league early . &quot;
in the South of Li@@ g it only ran@@ ged to rank six .
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; this we have managed and this is the most important , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master Col@@ kt@@ as the game was better .
&quot; above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who de@@ cip@@ hered the foundation for the 14th title with 26 seasonal figures . &quot;
that is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year old .
&quot; in the course of the AC Florence on the contract , the Gom@@ ez had only been announced after the coup d after the coup , because of the political situation in the country after its EM @-@ on holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must only say , &quot; cited the journal &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; club@@ chief Fi@@ cre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; to do this , the storms would have to be prepared to rel@@ inqu@@ ish around a third of his to 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; his salary in Florence cannot be paid . &quot;
&quot; despite dop@@ ing , these athletes still have medals opportunities at Olympia in Rio &quot;
the 34 @-@ year J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was locked twice due to dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ ano@@ wa must not start in Rio .
others over@@ led athle@@ tics sin@@ ner can only laugh - they are fighting in Rio around medals .
the topic D@@ oping determined according to the headlines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; the Russian ser@@ ene in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ o@@ wa , who compl@@ ained about the games after a D@@ oping lock , was dropped off at their start ( 100 meters chest ) gn@@ y off and booked out . &quot;
it offered a sk@@ ur@@ le scenery : with a set smile she was still proud in the hall and prov@@ oked with her appearance .
&quot; stated that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a j@@ ub@@ el@@ storm . &quot;
&quot; but there are many more athletes , who go to the start despite D@@ oping past at the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was imprisoned twice ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since his spell the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion continues even faster than before , he is more than 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the greatest challenge of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m Staff@@ el / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympi@@ ad and seven @-@ fold World in had to sit down in 2010 a six month period after taking the intake of pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , you have had strong dental pain , defended the 29 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : 2011 was the Olympics of the 2012 World Championship in 2013 and European Championships in 2010 to 2016 had a positive effect on the bot@@ anic stimul@@ ant of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine .
Per@@ kovic entered the wis@@ ely intake and was locked six months .
the four broad@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gol@@ d@@ fav@@ ors .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ horseback ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Olympi@@ as and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was tested positively and 21 months have been locked . &quot;
a means of penis enlargement would have been responsible to em@@ bark@@ ed Mer@@ horseback .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the most fastest man in the world .
&quot; I@@ wan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ throw , Belarus ) : probably barely any athletes were subsequently realised so many medals . &quot;
&quot; thus , Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after with him Testoster@@ one dop@@ ing . &quot;
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to leave Olympia @-@ silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ Dop@@ ings and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
&quot; this also recognized Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ aille of the Olympic Games in 2008 , he returned because of a part of the International Sport@@ Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; with 80@@ ,@@ 04 m he is ranked number two of the worlds list . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world &apos;s world chan@@ cell@@ or and Gold@@ fav@@ ored was tested only in May , but must still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 year old world @-@ World , references to the intake of a forbidden dietary supplements have been found , the Sper@@ re of the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency W@@ ada fell and ran already on 13 July . &quot;
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian incar@@ nate - Sever@@ al t@@ ote
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stand with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the State Department , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; they have suffered f@@ aded and had been treated in the hospital , but have already left them again . &quot;
your visit@@ ation dates will be scheduled for early September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holidays island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ on as well as Austrian citizens are not yet unclear . &quot;
&quot; the State Department stand in close contact with local authorities , so whis@@ per . &quot;
&quot; at about 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in were first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a ch@@ opped area of two bombs . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , an Tha@@ il@@ changing has been killed and about 20 people have been wounded , including the Austrian , three German , three rainf@@ all and three Italians . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning then two explo@@ sives went up high , and according to the authorities , another man was killed . &quot;
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket has been reported in the morning a bomb blast .
near the Det@@ on@@ ation near the popular bathing beach Pat@@ ong was injured after police information a taxi driver has been injured .
&quot; at Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the southeast coast of the country , another bomb that k@@ ills an urban landscape . &quot;
the spr@@ inkl@@ er has gone to the air according to the authorities in a cau@@ li@@ flower in front of the Re@@ four of the coastal police .
&quot; finally , detection still demanded in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the southwest coast , as well as in Ch@@ om@@ on on the southeast coast several injured . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called . &quot;
&quot; the bomb attack carry the same manuscript , &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai Krit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday early in front of journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a coordinated attack .
it is too early to express yourself at possible motives - probably it is about the deeds of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to see a sample in the attacks by the attacks which is typical for the bombing of mus@@ li@@ ous separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; in contrast , the Thai police declared the attacks not in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said one speaker in Bangkok . &quot;
it is rather obvious that the bombs of oppos@@ ers of the ruling military jun@@ ta have been laid .
&quot; in recent days , the authorities would have given secrecy about upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however , they did not have been informed of the exact time and places . &quot;
&quot; be unclear , which group behind the attacks . &quot;
&quot; the police proved their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important governmental buildings as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and leisure time . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are always smaller bomb attacks , but they are mostly not opposed to tourists . &quot;
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace designed by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ id Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; after the course of this year , the Austrian Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to do the Austrian Foreign Ministry in his homepage , the instructions of Thai security authorities in a consequence . &quot;
&quot; high safety risk ( safety level 3 ) paid for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a , as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ hear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; following conflicts between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no necessary travel to these provinces . &quot;
increased safety risks ( safety level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday spent a few days after a controversial referendum held by the military jun@@ ta .
this space will also influence the military influence over the coming years .
&quot; Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ Ch@@ a said the bombs should have been an attempt to sti@@ p@@ aces chaos , while the country is moving towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody distur@@ ban@@ ces , considers itself self @-@ profit to have led the kingdom again to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military did not succeed in getting the rebels in the extreme south of the country for years in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
just a year ago in Bangkok they were killed in a popular Hin@@ du @-@ Sch@@ purely 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack of the younger history of the country .
the &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; is placed in the vision of the Federal Constitutional Court for constitutional protection . &quot;
&quot; after several local authorities , the Constitutional Court made the group under supervision . &quot;
&quot; we see at the &apos; identity movement &apos; clue to efforts against the free democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Administr@@ ative Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , the migrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist fashion . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we watch the movement now . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; and the &quot; loss of its own identity by over@@ flow . &quot;
&quot; constitutional elected in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - observe the &quot; identity &quot; already . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , his authority have been closely coordinated with the offices . &quot;
&quot; groups such as the &quot; identity movement &quot; try to pick their target group , where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional chief . &quot;
&quot; generally speaking , extremis@@ ts to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
&quot; the ties of the Islam@@ ists , as well as right @-@ wing extremism . &quot;
this is not liable for the one &apos;s own cause .
propaganda should address people emotion@@ ally .
young people are in a special manner .
this is dangerous .
&quot; most recently , there had been reports of contacts of the &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D @-@ politicians . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , he did not have any knowledge . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible interactions of this type are only relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it comes to whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - through certain persons , which are extrem@@ ist , which is extrem@@ ist to change its target and thus becomes extrem@@ ist . &quot;
so deciding whether such people have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view of the marked increase of legitimate criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodations Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
but in recent years we noticed that there can be ri@@ ght@@ r@@ or@@ istic structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
&quot; it may well be that further ri@@ ster@@ r@@ or@@ istic group@@ ings or small groups form , the attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee camps or attack from other far @-@ right @-@ wing motives . &quot;
but a German @-@ wide or pan @-@ wide control of leg@@ ster@@ r@@ ism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; moreover , Ma@@ ate told us that many attacks went to the account of people who were not lab@@ elled in the right scene . &quot;
this is the worrying .
&quot; many of the suspected suspected of asylum seekers were not previously known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or followers of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many people have committed crimes that had previously failed with right @-@ wing extremis@@ ts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or have chosen for example CD@@ U , SPD or left , who then radic@@ alised themselves through far @-@ wing extremism . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is used for Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
the Olympi@@ ads or world records determine the headlines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the brave appearance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center sw@@ am of the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slow , that he was temporarily no longer seen in the TV pictures . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was chosen .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently used to viral Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a set@@ back of 48 seconds and took the 5@@ 9th place of 59 starters . &quot;
but it was rather his not just sporty figure who attracted the attention of international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still participates in the Olympic Games ?
Ethiop@@ ians received a special start from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ presented countries more known .
&quot; since in orthop@@ e@@ dic@@ s run most athle@@ te , Hab@@ te wanted to make something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the great race .
quickly the first nickname made the lap .
some media marked him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of the W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; in reference to a &quot; &quot; abundance &quot; &quot; the English Bou@@ lev@@ ard@@ sheet &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; about him funny . &quot;
&quot; his time , he recently struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter c@@ isti@@ l , who played no role . &quot;
compare with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney , the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ vel@@ ban@@ i for medi@@ al attention . &quot;
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ atorial Guinea when he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 meters of Fre@@ isti@@ l alone .
fr@@ ene@@ tically was fired M@@ ous@@ vel@@ ban@@ i at that time .
at that time 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned eight months before the Olympics and had never done such a long distance before the competition .

&quot; should it be nothing with the election of the U.S. president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative video . &quot;
he then drive into the holiday .
&quot; does Donald Tr@@ ump will lose the US presidential elections in November , it would be relatively no matter , &quot; ultimately it will either catch up , or I have a very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the candidate of Re@@ public@@ ans in a telephone interview with the U.S. TV broad@@ band CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it is not rich for him in the end of the reasons of the political correctness , it is fine , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he described the US President Barack Obama and the nomin@@ ee of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , as founder of the terrorist militia ( IS ) . &quot;

the interest of other firms in the vessel is obviously great .
the Post is planning to sell their electric vehicle sco@@ oter to sell .
&quot; in short , the Group wants to launch the trade with the transpor@@ ter . &quot;
the post wishes to offer its electrical transportation from the coming year on the free market .
&quot; we want to enter into the sale to third parties , &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot;

G@@ FR@@ P @-@ leadership occurs after dis@@ closing business figures
the consumer @-@ research company Gf@@ K exchanged his head Matthias Hart@@ mann .
&quot; suddenly , the feedback came suddenly - but not quite surprising . &quot;
&quot; the difficult situation of the Gf@@ K company Gf@@ K considers that the chair of Directors Matthias Hart@@ mann is all the more uncertain , the longer the successes will remain unaffected . &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the head of Nuremberg market research @-@ owned company Gf@@ K : after again disappointing business figures and the withdrawal of business management is the global number five in the industry before a new beginning .
G@@ FR@@ P @-@ executive director wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
&quot; the chairman of the Gf@@ K supervisory council Arno Mahl@@ ert , with effect on September 12 from the supervisory body . &quot;
&quot; as of September 1 , the leadership of the Executive Board take advantage of the previous Executive Board by Gerhard Haus@@ sch@@ inger , shared the company . &quot;

&quot; if in future the market research company will be le@@ ased , it is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; in An@@ le@@ ger@@ circles , it was meant to be on Friday , in the shareholders be the disappointment about the continuing success of the restructuring ahead of years ago . &quot;
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K summit since 2011 .
&quot; but the fruits of the restructuring , however , are not yet visible after 5 years . &quot;
&quot; given the last bad Gf@@ K business , every shareholders will eventually become un@@ steady . &quot;
&quot; if that would be the case at BMW , this would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; said it . &quot;
the company did not stop its losses in the previous quarter of 2016 in the second quarter of 2016 .
&quot; with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales rose by 6.@@ 1 percent less than the previous year &apos;s level . &quot;
&quot; for the first half of the year , sales generated with 7@@ 2@@ 4.2 million euros by 3.4 per cent . &quot;
&quot; the profit in the second quarter , above all , has been deb@@ ited by the company in view of its difficult economic situation . &quot;
&quot; the consumer &apos;s business experience is necessary for the company &apos;s value inspections of 139 million Euros , under the St@@ rich a loss of 14@@ 8.@@ 2 million . &quot;
in the second quarter of 2015 the Gf@@ K managed to gain a workforce of 19.@@ 7 million in the second quarter of 2015 .

&quot; due to the legal basis , the market is oblig@@ ated to use a legal basis to run the systems free of charge . &quot;
&quot; from 1 October 2016 the citizen , as well as the commercial and industrial establishments from cat@@ ches , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ asse , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg must take deeper into the w@@ allet . &quot;
the ag@@ it@@ ating increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Chairman Manager Herbert Schmidt called on the body , a re @-@ calculation of fees for waste water treatment was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , it should be the same as super@@ - or under@@ covers from the previous calendar period . &quot;
&quot; in all three se@@ wage installations , Schmidt founded it with all three se@@ wage systems for relatively small facilities with a very low wast@@ e@@ water @-@ incident , which lie between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; thus , due to the low distribution principles , for example , expenses for a necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would have a serious impact . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the se@@ wage is slightly declined in all three units . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the last three @-@ time period in all three plants are not least due to their age of restoration and repair applications in a considerable extent . &quot;
&quot; the facility in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ fare , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ ots almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that in the se@@ wage system Az@@ endorf the mechanical aer@@ ation system had to be replaced due to damage .
&quot; in the pump , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led for almost 20 years and in the pond @-@ ran@@ ger l@@ ording to nearly 20 years of operation of the first Kl@@ är@@ ch , had to be extended after nearly 20 years of operation of the first Kl@@ är@@ ch , and an additional ventilation option to be built in order to keep the water @-@ legal requirements in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; these extraordinary expenses came into consideration the advanced training and maintenance costs , which are in accordance with the new calendar period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which in the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 is still significantly below the current level . &quot;
&quot; stone houses made clear that with the low wast@@ e@@ water , the expendi@@ tures for the operation and maintenance . &quot;
&quot; moreover , complementary Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs at the se@@ wage systems has remained spar@@ ed over the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for these plants will continue to be prec@@ arious based on stone houses , especially since one could not extend the supply area of the se@@ wage system of Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal to these installations , because it is a deficit . &quot;
Bulgaria fully booked for the first time in 8 months .
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year as a positive 0.2 % .
the annual rapid de@@ flation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after the CP@@ I -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.@@ 0 % . &quot;
inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was 0.@@ 2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was 0.@@ 2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , the following groups of consumer goods has been observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; Transport and Culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0,@@ 3 % ) ; &quot;
&quot; the prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; Mo@@ bili@@ ar , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.@@ 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the prices remained as in advance at alcoholic drinks and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education remains unchanged . &quot;
sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; -@@ effect as Asian caricature critic@@ ises
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter anim@@ e is inspired but some observers say that it is uns@@ ensi@@ tivity towards breeds .
&quot; with its filter tool , it allows sn@@ ap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that is already an absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be paintings from a Roy Licht@@ enstein paintings . &quot;
&quot; the filters are in@@ dur@@ ated , stand@@ by @-@ rot@@ ate tools that generate more than 30 million improved selection per day . &quot;
all failures will come to the public .
sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have been drawn up in the past criticism in which they were accused that the app would cause Black@@ face or white skin as beauty ideal .
&quot; when this week made a filter a filter that gave them sli@@ pper@@ y , false teeth and un@@ d@@ uns@@ hed che@@ eks , there were some critics a rac@@ ist caricature of A@@ sians - &quot; yel@@ lo@@ wing . &quot; &quot;
they asked whether these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has with diversity .
&quot; the news and the outra@@ ge were widely used on Wednesday , with reports from The ver@@ ge and motherboard , one day after sn@@ ap@@ chat , that it would have de@@ activated the feature . &quot;
the company had an excuse : the filter was meant as a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as caricature of A@@ sians .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders who experienced rac@@ is@@ sm , rec@@ alled the filter for viol@@ ating c@@ is@@ che@@ es . &quot;
others refused to the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote a Korean @-@ American art student , whose tro@@ we@@ et was widely used over the photos that the filter &quot; hur@@ ting and e@@ ased was said unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the antagon@@ isms of a very conflic@@ ting Asian cartoon and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yellow , but that the yel@@ lo@@ wing was pulled into the down@@ ward extreme . &quot;
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crossed this cultural Stol@@ per@@ dra@@ in .
&quot; the American culture seems to be involved in an endless dialogue and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all keep in hand . &quot;
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats a great audience of young people - who in the race are di@@ vers@@ ed as their elderly counterparts - could be more of it going out to be sen@@ sibility .
&quot; when one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats fil@@ tern is created a picture that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s a lot harder to remain un@@ noticed when it was previously the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ year K@@ atie Zh@@ u in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Zh@@ u , who works as product manager and engineering in medium , their Sn@@ ap@@ chat account , and called for others to do the same . &quot;
in a set of medium and in a telephone interview she told that they believe that r@@ ô@@ @-@ related controversi@@ es will reflect a lack of diversity with the adju@@ sters practices in Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Zh@@ u critici@@ zed the most part white , only male leadership and ended up with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colour in their workforce so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the chin@@ ich American Zh@@ u , &quot; or they have people with other skin colour who work there , but not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable , in order to say something about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint , the Sn@@ ap@@ chat was largely un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish any numbers on the diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , there were Sn@@ ap@@ chat on Thursday to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees , but according to a speaker , the company has recently focused a personnel responsible , which focused on under@@ presented population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Zh@@ u said her to let her Sn@@ ap@@ chat Account will be closed and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. &quot;
military @-@ negotiated ISIS intelligence information , provides committee on Congress &quot;
&quot; military members of the United States Central Command changed political information to draw an optimistic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , than the actual states on the spot would have allowed the investigation committee of Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of armed forces , intelligence agencies and the Wehr@@ bud@@ get@@ ary , reported by large dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence agencies who reported how pro@@ vision@@ aries changed their assessments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; news@@ letters , which has been characterized by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders , represented regularly a more positive image of American efforts against terrorism than the actual states on site and have been more positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; cited a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what is done at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering when poor analyses of our political leaders are presented , &quot; presented Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can@@ ic member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the leadership errors in Cent@@ Com are far enough until the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed ongoing problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts at the education of the Iraqi armed forces .
&quot; although there is no direct references to that government tips given under Obama instructions , it shows how analysts saw the pressure from their preliminary laws , an optimal picture of the threat of the Islamic state , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements above the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts presented . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com provider announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s can already be started in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ su@@ l , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , it is so clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can congress members from K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the tops of Central Command changed the after@@ math reports to play the risk of ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
re@@ public@@ ans called the Task Force in Life after they played that analysts are worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings during the investigations .
&quot; in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the General Secretary of Defense Department . &quot;
democratic members of the Newsletter on Thursday released their own findings that coinci@@ des with some of the conclusions of Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the preparation of subsequent inter@@ mitt@@ ances at IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the highest degree of democr@@ at Adam B. ship , in an opinion of opinion . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of paper @-@ related reports , &quot; repar@@ ations the moral under analysts and &quot; gave a little space for devi@@ ating opinions . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said , no references to an intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ Com analy@@ st on a &quot; certain political opinion &quot; have found . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported by investigations by the General Assembly of the Pentagon , which were recorded according to complaints from Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot;
&quot; L@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a spokes@@ man of the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defense would not have any reports of Congress , while the investigation of the General Staff was still under way . &quot;
&quot; but he also said that &quot; &quot; experts at times have quite diver@@ ging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Defense Department gave a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defence . &quot;
&quot; the investigations on the question of a successful aviation campaign led by an American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion , which is made by a growing number of members of the Defense Department ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question to what extent President Obama can rely on the Central Command of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism regarding the secret information of the Islamic State remind of constraints of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a writer on how many analysts met with the recommendations of many analysts just a small occupation of occupation in Iraq , and a little time on it turned to thought about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker to mention government agencies that would not have any significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these temporary refin@@ eries were put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; this knowledge was however not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legis@@ lature by members of the legislative situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US winning fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women ; a show@@ down with the UK stands before
&quot; one day after they shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 winner over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americ@@ an@@ ers won with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually represent an unforgettable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I do not belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
&quot; however , that knows them : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the olymp@@ ic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , which remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which the two will gain in their group from six teams at first and second place . &quot;
the first place placed the strong wood @-@ country a little longer off the way that the other group will lead .
&quot; as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex through their success story , four years after she landed at the last London Games in the last few of 12 places . &quot;
B@@ AM was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a Ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ r@@ ack@@ et in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the National Bank of the USA , the most recent in the history of the team . &quot;
&quot; she missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , as she could not qualify for the kay@@ ak . &quot;
then the year 2012 came in which she and her team went all wrong .
&quot; in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham was born , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of the National Team and thus began to turn things to better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have to work in London that we now have .
we have all able to s@@ nat@@ ch the rod completely .
on Thursday morning B@@ am opened the Tor@@ ri@@ ms in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the close range .
&quot; India was going to play in the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed himself surprisingly tough and held the board of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took their hands in their hands . &quot;
&quot; it brought a Spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the center and took the ball into the gate to get the American female a 2 @-@ 0 leadership . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last district .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first round of the tournament for the go@@ al@@ keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
exactly like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on Saturday the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of trampoline . &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro feel free and in@@ escap@@ ably , a rapid season between competition and pursuit . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if the olymp@@ ic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning spot , which is removed from the bracel@@ et to the swi@@ mmer to the tri@@ athle@@ te . &quot;
&quot; you can not turn the TV , read a paper or listen to the conversation of your neighbors in the queue in Coff@@ es@@ hop , without hearing with Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ ather@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is still Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time in the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s warm with di@@ m@@ ples , could have been quite among these known names could have been sent to Prime Time , build through sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising , if he would be a swi@@ mmer , tur@@ ner or even fe@@ eder . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights in the olymp@@ ic trampoline for gold . &quot;
the olymp@@ ic flame does not illuminated any event straight away .
&quot; further from the center , partially in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized : air@@ brush , ar@@ chery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the chest swimming and may it rule for a long time .
&quot; but if I should modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me direct the attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline has already been a olymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it had been in Sydney , the last 16 years it was so spar@@ ed that many that I interviewed did not know that it is a Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes to the competition , there has never been a medal in the trampoline and had made an athle@@ te until 2012 , who made it until the final . &quot;
the Chinese and Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Can@@ adi@@ ans to share the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ on from Canada this year will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the trampoline has a certain out@@ sider tip , partly because it sounds more suitable for a clo@@ wn@@ ess school than that sounds for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a single enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the car@@ to@@ on@@ able tre@@ mor of his never to end clouds - but also the Grazie of the turn@@ around and num@@ bing , the two sports that it essentially unites . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling moves ( turning , he@@ ater and sal@@ tos ) before they land at the feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official Olympics for execution , difficulty level and &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , are competing against each other in Rio . &quot;
the common Olympic vector is straight straight .
&quot; med@@ all@@ ying hopes to go further in their quest for gold , faster , upwards and above , sometimes up to the destination , sometimes back and back , upwards and down to the playground . &quot;
&quot; they chase not only the Zi@@ ell@@ in@@ ie or the output wall , but in the television transmission , another height : the world or the Olympi@@ apark . &quot;
&quot; the pur@@ pos@@ eful pursuit is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to even stir up an audience to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I want to look at the watch of these games as something er@@ ti@@ ring .
the trampoline offers a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the vector of the trampoline is top .
a backward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she pr@@ un@@ ed , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ lessness like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes upward , then down@@ wards , then effortlessly back up . &quot;
&quot; here there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise , there is no h@@ ectic attack on the goal , no ri@@ bs to the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; the qualification and end @-@ round of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in Streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; most of the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will beam up the narro@@ wer as part of a afternoon bloc on both days from 14@@ .00 .
&quot; in the middle of Olympia Man@@ ia , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in general turmoil . &quot;
if the consciousness of consciousness can only be achieved through the anxiety and the objective of male athletes - as the male American Tur@@ ner following the Wall Street Journal recently proposed - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits his after air the new fan base .
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstrators are calling for political changes in Ethiopia and are based on violent resistance by the government .
witnesses say that sixty prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with police officers .
is Ethiopia straight forward to break up ?
&quot; over the last ten years , it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in recent months , protests against the government turned the country and extended into more and more areas . &quot;
last week thousands of people rus@@ hed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s answer to human rights organisations was in@@ mer@@ ciful .
witnesses told that poli@@ c@@ emen were shot in an un@@ armed prot@@ esters .
&quot; cre@@ eping videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how safety people were hit with sticks while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Security Agency for Human Rights now demands a thorough investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it becomes even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ian region to fight terror over the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if at all , get as much western aid . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new pend@@ ulum in the capital of Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have consistently pursued the oppression of the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , whereby dis@@ sident was effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many have been sent into exile , or sent into prison , killed or driven into the deser@@ ts of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you sup@@ press people and these no other options have to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lec@@ turer in central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot;
the entire youth are prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
&quot; there are numerous ail@@ ments , which covers everything from the ground @-@ use until the saus@@ age in relation to power of the ruling coalition . &quot;
&quot; following a widely critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies led the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the tensions continue along the border to Eritrea ; a battle for this cont@@ ent@@ an@@ ed , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts were just like the Oro@@ mo @-@ liberation front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of O@@ ga@@ den in recent years more or less imposed on the turbul@@ ence and could be ar@@ ming themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness after years of falling apart from the surface now explo@@ de .
the first appears harmless : smart phones .
&quot; only in recent years , a lot of Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media as bil@@ berry Smartphones became more and more common and the Internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government bonds access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , mainly in protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies which conce@@ al where they are staying . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians insisted that they were gathered together so prot@@ esters .
&quot; the second factor is that there are more solidarity between Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons prosp@@ eri@@ ed the Am@@ har@@ as , which come from Aegean , predominantly Christian high@@ lands , during the politics and the economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but even this changes straight .
&quot; we are here to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of the Am@@ hara and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which constitute about 6 percent of the population and that are dominant in the military , in the secret services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the unrest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former Reb@@ els leader , was until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 , 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as tactical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
analysts say that it was particularly disgu@@ ised to perceive early signs of dis@@ content and to use special requests to edit opponents and make them unhealthy .
&quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian new Prime Minister , Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ achi Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively un@@ careful reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came out of the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiop@@ ian , Mr Hai@@ tian mari@@ achi come from the south . &quot;
analy@@ st say that he does not enjoy the trust of the Tig@@ ray controlled security services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia was experienced such a turmoil in 2005 , after thousands of elections were prot@@ ested , which apparently was stolen by the government , according to Analy@@ tical Government and subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the following ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even though it was less than in the last months and those days of unrest went over quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new pend@@ ulum , as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
&quot; but obviously , this has not prevented the intention of internal dis@@ appearances of the Ethiop@@ ian government . &quot;
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month , prot@@ esting in Gon@@ dar , an official city , of Tig@@ ray @-@ run shops and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray will ever more exercise in social media . &quot;
analy@@ st say that the protests against the US and other Western allies are in a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ ym flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if it was recently signed that it has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West wants to fully support democracy , he does not want his allies collap@@ ses in a already volati@@ le area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin atro@@ city . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his asser@@ tion Obama was founded &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to dissi@@ p@@ ate the last controversy that surrounds his campaign by giving his repeatedly repeated asser@@ tion President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State .
this clari@@ fications gave new questions to the communic@@ ability of the presidential system of Re@@ public@@ ans whether he is able to communicate clearly and to communicate with the American public .
&quot; it also brings his collaborators , who try to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , in the actual position , explaining statements which he could not meant at all . &quot;
&quot; after he had made the activation of a voting event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump in relation to the claim on Thursday returned and consisted in interviews that he really was not intended to indicate the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday said Mr. Tr@@ ump , he is just sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was contrary to the previous day when Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely seriously . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hugh He@@ wit@@ t , Mr. Tr@@ y wanted to weaken the statement a little to weaken it , that Mr. Obama wants to destroy it , wanted to know the Republi@@ can presidential election . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism pus@@ hes down to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tried to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling circum@@ ference on the economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked to the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this subject .
&quot; on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ ton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he continued strong criticism as he said , the Russians ought to crack Mrs. Clin@@ t &apos;s emails , but later he said , &quot; Of course I meant the sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to shift the linguistic borders in politics and then to ruin .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of its methods to test how certain messages from his fans will be taken as they arrive , and then if necessary &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; according to what the reaction fails . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication experts who watched the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also believe , he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of determined to def@@ use the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has taken an even less sound , as its re@@ plen@@ itude continued to go back . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was released on Friday , showed a guided tour with great lead in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ on @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; during Mr. Tr@@ ump in general , he tries to apologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative expressions , he frequently accused his critics frequently to dist@@ ort his statements or humour . &quot;
&quot; but while he is reinforced in the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps Scher@@ ze have brought forth his loyal co @-@ collaborators into the unknown situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may also be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ umps of famous Prin@@ c@@ essors , gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he was asked about the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ umps statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that Obama ISIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it h@@ amm@@ ers , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he pulled troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most Mainstre@@ am Re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton , as Foreign Minister , it allowed ISIS to spread out the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control . &quot;
&quot; ahead of the election events in Pennsylvania , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and cast them out against each of his words to horse @-@ horse and be taken against him . &quot;
&quot; he infl@@ ated the &quot; poor , j@@ une &quot; television experts who try to understand and said , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of the Democrats mo@@ ck over Mr. Tr@@ umps , as only one further proof that he is in@@ appropriate for the presidential office . &quot;
&quot; once over the price of the market , Café is coming back in Green@@ point &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a s@@ hab@@ by cafe in Williamsburg , where you could only pay cash that no Wi @-@ Fi had , but for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front was displaced . &quot;
&quot; the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , set up in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of C@@ up@@ cakes . &quot;
native people as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ i wrote on Twitter , &quot; &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still cannot believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b now is a soap shop . &quot;
&quot; but if New York change is , then it is also new . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ animated ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accept credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere . &quot;
coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing staff of the old cafes , owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he began to work in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
&quot; when a customer offered a client to provide money for a new outside , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ guez , 36 , be@@ held a lot . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the Bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so @-@ model .
it even uses the same lamps out of the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment as well .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu sand@@ wiches along with bac@@ on and cheese and there are Gar@@ ni@@ bs such as chap@@ ers and sour oni@@ ons .
there are Natur@@ re@@ iss@@ ors .
&quot; there is no beer serving beer , there are fresh juice . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ guez said that he has noticed a st@@ alled stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also pushed out by prices of Williamsburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , formerly lived in Williamsburg and visited the ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after it was moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way forward . &quot;
&quot; after the ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coffee sink , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that it was on the coffee and the culture in the ver@@ b that liked me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she has coffee again , even if she ordered this day instead of their usual i@@ ced coffee , a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea ordered , which is another addition of a new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal became a further long@@ time and loyal customer since the beginning of the year 2003 .
he went there before work and ordered inevitably the same thing .
&quot; I came back to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket clock and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez said that he won &apos;t show a group@@ ing that the soap @-@ shop has taken the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owner of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie was offered to produce a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go on to their offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot;
&quot; the café also accepted the traditional , Polish residents Green@@ points . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish , and Rodri@@ guez said that he has imagined to make them soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome . &quot;
the site also has other advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ local wants to fill and sell the cold bre@@ wed coffee in the bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café expands into a remote building .
for many customers a new ver@@ b is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a writer and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the subject of the Lok@@ as and the Order felt a new coffee like a home@@ coming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell the smell , &quot; he said . &quot;
the depres@@ sing food of the economic crisis in &quot; an abundant meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his climb to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano took Roosevelt and his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a delic@@ acy , President Roosevelt had a f@@ ai@@ ble for refined delicacies on Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland Water@@ shield soup . &quot;
&quot; his menu on this day was a little more modest : packed eggs in tomato sauce , mas@@ hed potato and as dessert a ball pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with ordinary people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ography .
&quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; was about Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; about living in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest cooperation , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at the Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a re@@ porter at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ ör@@ k@@ ell@@ os@@ em Imb@@ iss in Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the IP@@ crash 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh@@ water sand@@ wich with olive oil , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with mas@@ hed and vegetable @-@ mixture ate . &quot;
&quot; when the re@@ porter ordered chips , this was the pair for discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there was pe@@ an@@ ut , liver cheese and sav@@ ing@@ bro@@ t . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and somewhat cheaper to the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ an@@ uts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
co@@ gr@@ ins .
&quot; it must have laid down in the stomach like b@@ lei , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women cooked for male rock work , and it was served fresh baked Past@@ ete for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; there were the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first World War . &quot; a Square &quot; , &quot; the paths facing , with which the country started to be , no longer the lar@@ s@@ aff@@ en@@ land . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when eating for Americans was a central , tense theme , &quot; I beg@@ ged co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; in the same way the new bud@@ get@@ ary was : mysterious food such as loaves and cas@@ u@@ ghts have become a stap@@ le food , the cas@@ ser@@ olle as &quot; wonderful Art , food remains re@@ plac@@ eable , &quot; mer@@ ges Zi@@ egel@@ man , as cooks were able to hide unpleasant ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by a low @-@ drying dr@@ y@@ st .
&quot; meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rare and fourth luxury . &quot;
&quot; peculiar compounds were tried , as a cal@@ orie @-@ cal@@ orie satisfaction had preced@@ ence over taste or even healthy kitchen . &quot;
&quot; during their research for the book , which includes recipes , you prepared a dish from this time , baked oni@@ ons with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition to the mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man goes further out : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked oni@@ ons are not fit together .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
&quot; as never before or since then , fiscal economics - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 , the eating habits of the country like . &quot;
&quot; by reading recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; household leaders &quot; &quot; and to transform the pamp@@ er like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots in delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square &quot; &quot; is a celebration of historical delicacies . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the reports of the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , like President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ cake @-@ eating attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple Iowa farm@@ houses of his kitchen , spe@@ ar it like the millions of millions of world , to which he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked Continental kitchen like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost ver@@ golden menu and carried a smo@@ king .
he was deli@@ ght@@ fully re@@ prehen@@ sive .
&quot; President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have prompted him to stat@@ u@@ ate with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the house@@ keeper described a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs Roosevelt , that the White House brought the most boring food in Washington but also one of the most dri@@ fted food prepared . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , to deal with food , was rejected as soon as the land returned to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food . &quot;
&quot; the couple gave to the writing of the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man @-@ in @-@ law , better understood - for example , how they could not throw food . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; she actually made people ill . &quot;
there was the wind@@ way of windsurfing .
&quot; after the plates at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s were vac@@ ated , they went and co@@ e dessert a dessert that they had dressed at home : the pl@@ ums , the President Roosevelt at lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a nasty trick , humble sp@@ ans to send a name to . &quot;
&quot; there was no s@@ la@@ wed cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone do@@ ves something reluc@@ t@@ antly to a spo@@ on in the tough , brown gli@@ der . &quot;
surprisingly it tasted not bad .
co@@ e took three times a desc@@ endant .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ tic , he said to his wife , &quot; A pair of wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed by bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game in order to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar devoted his life to man in Syria .
he ris@@ ki@@ cked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old even died in a façade attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; Omar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group , who saved the life according to picture @-@ newspaper just under 60@@ ,000 people . &quot;
2@@ 900 volunteers add their own lives to the game to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to achieve first aid in the war @-@ area .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the Civil Prot@@ ect , which shows him at a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a child from the ruins of a house , went round the world . &quot;
it made the Syrians about the shining symbolic character in the Gre@@ ys of the war .
&quot; as a hero , he never seen himself , said according to the picture : &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die , save lives , I think that God looks in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Omar herself fell victim to the victim , he spoke in a video about the final bombing ra@@ ids in Syria . &quot;
the Heli@@ kop@@ ter have turned four fac@@ bom@@ bas@@ kets over the Alzheimer adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the poison@@ ous rem@@ n@@ ants of the Bom@@ b so that not children play with it , &quot; the picture cited his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Grön@@ land@@ hai : the oldest whir@@ l@@ tier is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie usually comes only during winter to finish surfaces .
this sh@@ i was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on the ship &apos;s research ship .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - until today .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie received only 150 years of offspring .
&quot; leis@@ urely swi@@ ms the Greenland shar@@ k at the bottom of the North Atlantic along , in an hour it comes on average just 1,@@ 220 meters wide . &quot;
&quot; only when it arrives , speeds up the five meters long animals on s@@ atte 2,@@ 6 km / h - and with this maximum speed is half as fast as a seal . &quot;
&quot; this from cross @-@ suffici@@ ency , but seems to be a patent for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate by a Greenland , which could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; said Alexander Sch@@ weis@@ sen from Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life @-@ span , which means for vert@@ ebr@@ ates a world record . &quot;
&quot; admittedly , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist already suspected that Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie st@@ ony become old . &quot;
only lacking the evidence .
&quot; Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie are difficult to observe , eventually they live mainly in the polar sea before the thin@@ ly populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spit@@ s@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water @-@ temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually dive in the surface only in winter . &quot;
about the lifestyle of Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie researchers know accordingly little .
&quot; her time @-@ pent@@ agon Ma@@ es she , when she called six animals with a transm@@ itter , six animals before S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; loot , nevertheless , make this sh@@ arks nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal , researchers thought the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
&quot; possibly they hunt sle@@ ep@@ y animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the Iron , and search car@@ c@@ asses , which from higher water layers down@@ ward . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spit@@ s@@ bergen as a applause from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimeters long , while the largest 50@@ 2 cen@@ tim@@ etres measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed with the carbon @-@ 14 method the lin@@ sen@@ ators of the sh@@ arks . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye @-@ lin@@ se is already created before the birth of the sh@@ arks , which contained therein is no longer renewed . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the lin@@ sen@@ ators .
&quot; after the early 1960s , their birth should lie in the atmosphere after the early 1960s . &quot;
&quot; in that , with 220 centimeters of length of the smallest animal , the lin@@ sen@@ ators contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in its investigation in 2012 . &quot;
all major Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie had a normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their lenses . it is created by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ watch showed for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ tim@@ etres long Greenland , an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 cen@@ tim@@ etres can be even 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Green@@ land@@ hai females only get worse when they are longer than four meters , was well @-@ known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers could assign a age to the length of the length . &quot;
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimeters were probably at the threshold for sexually mature , and his age with 156 years was determined , Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie was obviously at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
&quot; also , this is likely to be a world record for vert@@ ebr@@ ates . &quot;
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ es live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence .
&quot; also the previous record @-@ holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Green@@ land@@ wal , in whose sp@@ eck at the neck a 120 years old har@@ po@@ on pointed , was captured before Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there live on savings . &quot;
so they mature later - and sometimes more slowly .
&quot; in order to warm water in the cold water , the animals are also often particularly big . &quot;
&quot; because the volume is much faster than its surface , by which the animal gets heat . &quot;
the heat loss of a gram is therefore much greater than in one gram elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous , and should concentrate on having as many descendants as soon as possible , &quot; explains the evolution of evolution . &quot;
&quot; however , a very big animal should rather invest its resources into a long life . &quot;
ground floor in a double @-@ pack
&quot; with themes around the building , the council has focused on the recent meeting . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the Panel adopted the Communication by Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently designated motorhome owners . &quot;
&quot; after the plot , par@@ zel@@ it@@ - and initial request have been clarified and the applications for measurement could be made , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; &quot; road route &quot; &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area of Bin@@ der@@ straße 1 ) is nothing more in the way . &quot;
the council is convinced that the blo@@ kes in rural beautiful and quiet residential community Schön@@ au young families and rude seniors equally appeal .
&quot; as it was called , Bau@@ willing to be able to report immediately to the town hall , on the allocation of the par@@ c@@ els , is expected to consult the council at his September session . &quot;
&quot; to also respond to requests for the settlement of other commercial companies , associated with the creation of jobs , decided to change the Common Market Council , which only in the spring of this year to change the set @-@ use plan for sub @-@ areas in sub @-@ areas . &quot;
thus in the sub @-@ time sector the commercial sector has already been expanded by two plots towards the state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
&quot; in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg will be the best opportunities to reloc@@ ated to London , Dublin and Luxembourg in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is most likely that Frankfurt benefits most from Bre@@ xit @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether money buildings continue to operate from London from financial transactions in the entire EU . &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport enough admission to the United Kingdom has so far enough to obtain approval in the UK .
that is just taking advantage of big US banks .
several banks have already announced jobs to shift jobs .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; Association anticip@@ ates new jobs on the Main @-@ Main Event for five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , so the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , brings responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important agencies like the European insurance coverage E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk Issu@@ ate ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) , although this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the bank bank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision &quot; , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; in Luxembourg a large fund industry , cuts , but also cuts in infrastructure from Dublin as well as Dublin . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the big airport .
&quot; furthermore , the city with slightly available commercial properties . &quot;
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Seine , rents for first @-@ class business properties by 50 percent higher than the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ran@@ kings of corporate consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city is ranked seven , Luxembourg in place 19 , Dublin to No. 33 and Paris in 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a matter of pre@@ di@@ lec@@ tions : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could attract other banks and investors . &quot;
&quot; but in spite of Bre@@ xit @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe , my economic researchers . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the forces of forces also speak : in London according to figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking sector , in Frankfurt , it was 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead receives right costs from the Hepatitis C patent stre@@ es with Mer@@ ck
an American refer@@ ee decided that Gilead Sciences Inc are entitled to a refund of the costs involved from Hep@@ ati@@ te C Legal Affairs with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June , Gilead was released from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , who stood in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drug of So@@ val@@ di and Harv@@ oni of Gilead , after an US @-@ judge a pattern of mis@@ conduct , including Mein@@ ei@@ der and other im@@ ethical acts . &quot;
&quot; on the complaint of the law@@ suit on Thursday , US minister@@ ial office in the Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to decree the cost which arose during the defence of the case . &quot;
Mer@@ ck is trying to pull together with Gilead to dominate the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications that can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver illness .
&quot; the case dates back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck took one another and the property on Labor@@ atories in claim to which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ o@@ vir , active ingredient in the medication of Gilead . &quot;

&quot; in 2015 , Clin@@ ton USD 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former President Bill Clinton generated an income of USD 3 million from the Verlag Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on their office in the State Department . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ ton &apos;s candidate , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton , his tax expl@@ or@@ ings over the last ten years . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ins continue to put standards regarding financial transparency .
&quot; in a contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false exc@@ uses and back@@ ups in terms of his previous promises to publish his tax statement . &quot;
it is common to publish US presidential data to publish their tax registr@@ ations although they are not obliged to do so .
&quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated as a reason for his ref@@ usal by tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ ton electoral campa@@ igning in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , in terms of publication of the presidential election of the Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ umps Special , to CN@@ N that he would not allow tr@@ ump to release something before the tax checks are not finished . &quot;
&quot; taking critics , among other things also the Republi@@ can presidential election at the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already missed out that his ref@@ usal issues relating to assets , his donations for charitable organisations , its business@@ man and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
Clinton has already over@@ thrown on the topic and released a video on the Internet on Friday to call on the high @-@ level re@@ public@@ ans Tr@@ ump to publish his tax statement .
on Thursday she spoke the subject even during a speech on the economy of Michigan .
&quot; he ref@@ uses this to do what has done any other presidential election in recent decades and publish its tax statement . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico has reported that Tr@@ y has paid no or only very little taxes during the 1990s , and an economic journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax @-@ rolled and tax advice on Friday that may still be the case . &quot;
Bundes@@ taxes have become an issue in the electoral campaign .
Clinton supports a rule that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and Investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that would make sure that people earn more than USD 1 million to pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama supports the proposal also .
&quot; during an election event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ ag@@ glomer@@ ate has his seat at a meeting to exchange their tax expl@@ or@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; he said Buff@@ ett as well , he was also subjected to a tax test of the IR@@ S and I have &quot; &quot; afraid &quot; &quot; of the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot;
Clin@@ t &apos;s campaign was back in 2007 back to the year 2007 .
&quot; the Clin@@ t , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid for an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40@@ .@@ 5 % . &quot;
the control of the Clin@@ ton &apos;s tax survey showed that it was only USD 100 of its income as wage @-@ wage - unlike most of all Americans .
&quot; its main funding was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clin@@ ton dividen@@ ds and income amounted to USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot;

&quot; condoms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works and promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as Eleph@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; environ@@ ment@@ ers in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from being inhabited , in people inhabited settlements - they throw condoms on them , which are filled with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der . &quot;
&quot; the method has proved effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation which had already trained the idea for years ago , together with the U.S. conservation of volunteers , trained by volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , a non@@ violent @-@ step method to protect their houses and harvest without damaging animals . &quot;
previously many sp@@ ans have been used to defend themselves .
Friday is a telephone day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit we could observe within this con@@ gregations to observe the eleph@@ ants from their fields without damaging the eleph@@ ants , &quot; said the CEO of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Damian Bell in a communication . &quot;
the first two steps cover the illumin@@ ate of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles into a horn .
&quot; when he is not sc@@ ared , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ er@@ ge@@ mix@@ t with earth is packed together with a fire @-@ union into a con@@ dom , whose end up to the ig@@ ni@@ tion is turned aside . &quot;
&quot; when it is lighted , the con@@ dom comes with a kno@@ b and spr@@ inkl@@ ed fine dust at Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der into the air . &quot;
a hint right usually already out to chase the elephant .
&quot; a last chance puts an adverti@@ ser , which sho@@ ots a golf mo@@ ist in the air and thereby caused a loud , bright explosion . &quot;
City Council unanim@@ ously decides : no ki@@ os@@ kel@@ ing at the St. Go@@ ar Rhein@@ u@@ fer
&quot; normally , the St. Go@@ ar investment projects of tra@@ des@@ men are usually taking place - especially the retail in the core city is considered to be clearly exten@@ dable . &quot;
&quot; the request for the new building of a sales ski@@ os@@ ks at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer , close to the building of the Rhein@@ bal@@ k@@ on , the city council did not get tired . &quot;
&quot; in principle , we welcome new tra@@ ilers , but at this location in the exp@@ elled situation at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer , this ki@@ osk does not fit the ki@@ osk , &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath stated to the CD@@ U faction . &quot;
&quot; Jewish director , Berliner Hotel , because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News &quot;
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots en@@ gros@@ sed a media burst , after he had betrayed the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotel in Berlin had not listed any Israeli pre @-@ election since it was requ@@ esting Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lan@@ z@@ mann , author of the Holocaust @-@ documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; ordered his anger in the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lan@@ z@@ mann tried to find Israel on the site of the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , is possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lan@@ z@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel about their own call center . &quot;
&quot; after a declaration , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer that he received there , &quot; &quot; woke him , &quot; &quot; as Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote . &quot;
&quot; the hotel employees said that the measure is a &quot; inten@@ tional decision by the executive management of the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the reason behind it was , sol@@ dering in the director still more anger . &quot;
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs , and they demanded that the pres@@ election is er@@ ased , &quot; the staff of Lan@@ z@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; great shame &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied by this event and upset .
this is really very embarrassing .
the fact that this is worn in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater shame .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; draws the right conclusions &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident rede@@ emed a fairly large resonance in the internet , where people named the whole scandal . &quot;
&quot; some under@@ stated the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotel , that it would have given the alleged &quot; &quot; Arab guests &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; ashamed to you , &quot; said it in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a Synago@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly pointed out all the accus@@ ations from themselves and called the incident a &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; &quot; at Lan@@ z@@ mann , reports The mirror . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; Israel does not enter into the quick@@ ening list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung proclaimed a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotel . &quot;
it adds that the di@@ alling code has now been added .
police sets out Tr@@ as@@ eng@@ as &amp; rubber bul@@ ls against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students participated in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police when they gathered together to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for the public educational system .
the police put lac@@ ri@@ eng@@ as and rubber bul@@ ls against the prot@@ esters .
&quot; the difficulties began , as a police officers attempted to cast the students apart , what led to the police rubber bul@@ ls and trou@@ gh eng@@ a . &quot;
several hundred students participated in demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation over the plans .
&quot; according to the proposals by the governor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , whereas 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the Protest@@ ants saw gra@@ ff@@ i@@ ti@@ ts against the provisional President of Michel Tem@@ er to walls .
the recent protests spent some days after prot@@ esters in masses on the streets to support the susp@@ ens@@ ory President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff that was put up by a vote of the Senate to their vocation from office .
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly increased to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the turnover set between Moscow and Teheran in the year at 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions on Iran were lifted , the interest in Russian companies engaged in business in the country , shared the Ambassador . &quot;
Russian companies provide existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; of course , the further trade building is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the trade agreement between Russia and Iran increased in the first five months of the year 2016 at 7@@ 0.@@ 9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , the Russian imports in Iran increased by 9@@ 1.5 per cent and contributed to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; the commercial recovery has been achieved by deliveries of machines , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said Ambassador . &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan is a record of Iranian tourists for this year .
&quot; last year the Russian foreign representative has been around 3@@ 5.000 Vis@@ as , first and foremost Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries , which affects the tourist number of countries in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record figures in Russia will be broken in Russia from last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes to change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend the visit of the cities Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have received the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;

the min@@ is@@ tran@@ ts from the past@@ or@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the road on a four @-@ day pilgrimage of Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together four stages were tackl@@ ed .
&quot; in order to bridge the time to the next Rom@@ ance of all min@@ is@@ tran@@ ts in the first two years , the upper round of St. Anna is determined to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; several pilgrimage targets has been tested and one finally decided for the bishop of Freiburg , where this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , opened a special pilgrimage to the Frei@@ burger Münster , a special pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Heiligen@@ stad arose . &quot;

Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rus@@ hed home as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last evening in the male team Spr@@ int at the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British Team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the An@@ chor@@ us , who had made his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the young and made the legend proud when he rus@@ hed to home to make a victory of favour@@ ites New Zealand . &quot;
&quot; England claimed a shocking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y fet@@ ched the fifth of six Olympi@@ ad medals . &quot;
&quot; she reiter@@ ated the trick , having spent in March at the Bahn World Championships in London despite the withdrawal of Hos@@ ys only one humble sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as Hin@@ der .
ho@@ ys retired a gap to conclude the K@@ ian E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
Sk@@ inner was the man in which they stayed when they saw potential in the br@@ isk that has now developed .
&quot; Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y Vict@@ ories - and Sk@@ inner set up a Olympics in the qualification rounds , but in the stand@@ ings of New Zealand the New Zealand in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; Hin@@ der was almost back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner was holding it . &quot;
&quot; a strategy change made a large part of the transformation , when adding a higher course to dec@@ eler@@ ate it and to keep it Kenn@@ y and above all sk@@ inner , to keep the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y saw from his position as the BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der , when this rose up on the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for me .
in the end we have placed an Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord and defeated the World Champion .
it was simply unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph of 2012 on the page Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ der was that he clearly fell off the train after a weak start . &quot;
he returned this statement later and there was no claim of England Rival .
with such a victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole GB flags on the Tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot;
we came together as a team in the last three months .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was amazing to win again at the Olympi@@ ad .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which has won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer for our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days at the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is possible in the area of the imagin@@ able that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a contest . &quot;
&quot; this would mean for Kenn@@ y - exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who also was born on 23 March ( an apparently holy date for the British Sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger B@@ ann@@ ister were born ) - a result of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
the Che@@ ese of the von Ho@@ y equal .
Kenn@@ y takes part next in the spr@@ int , which begins today and will go over three days . &quot;
&quot; said the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton , &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels somewhat lonely to win alone .
&quot; said : &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
it was the only med@@ all@@ ill@@ ary contest of the day but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed Clan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ o@@ dom@@ eter race . &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
&quot; the world record , won in London gold in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , at the Wig@@ dge &apos;s Security Council . &quot;
&quot; he had disputed prior to the qualification in front of the qualification yesterday , when the function@@ aries had to smell to measure his body size . &quot;
&quot; according to the women &apos;s competition , which is continued and ended tomorrow , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or Bark@@ er and K@@ atie Archives of Mil@@ n@@ gav@@ ie in World War 4 : 13.@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team looks forward to its strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick up a swe@@ ar of medals .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were dropped .
&quot; drama &apos;s drama in the background , as the res@@ ignation of the technical leader Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April , in the middle of Ses@@ is@@ - and Mob@@ b@@ ing@@ es , as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ leton . &quot;
&quot; however , when one sees the first evening of competition at the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the legendary reputation GB@@ s , which at the perfect moment has reached its peak , again to be repeated . &quot;
future of melting from Portland due to lifting energy consumption
&quot; the future of aluminium mel@@ tdown from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - are at stake , since the plant operators shall announce the energy supply agreement , and thus covering all delivery contracts , as the supply of energy companies . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies for operation of the plant . &quot;
a sub@@ strate for 20 years will exp@@ ire in November .
&quot; up to 2000 jobs in the complex of Al@@ coa in Portland , Portland &quot;
not less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct and indirect - could be endangered at a closure .
&quot; in addition , it could occur to dom@@ ino effects , as the melting has been around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Vict@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry Sch@@ mel@@ t@@ ei , which last year led to the closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station . &quot;
the melting of Al@@ coa in Portland lose money and risk a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of speculation as to the future of the plant , originally as a result of a strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplied the big aluminium f@@ eit@@ ing with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , shared with that three other owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the facility is in the multi@@ disciplinary property of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p can hold smaller proportions . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Portland is still run , resulting in a further physical demand for electricity by the melting system , &quot; shared the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L still said that the contracts are called &quot; &quot; backup transactions &quot; , &quot; which should have been in force from November 2016 . &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month period of notice that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; from that point , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to the revenue in the financial year 17 , &quot; said the electricity supply . &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently restricted by forecasts of strong sales markets for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L shared with that it has already written the value of the contracts in its annual rainf@@ all in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in the expectation of cancellation .
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... &quot; to operate or have the power supply to the melting &quot; not imp@@ aired . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. company said that in 2010 it has concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y yang , who should have been in force from November this year , even if there is still a statement that it came from the contract . &quot;
analy@@ st warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland Sch@@ mel@@ t@@ ei in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility close to Newcastle .
&quot; in reference to the statements of the analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said to consume around 600 mega@@ watts and tomato around 900 mega@@ watts . &quot;
&quot; if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a power producer this would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;

Oscar @-@ Econom@@ ist and Di@@ or @-@ brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even with the small chance that Ms Jen@@ ner - which is described from the magazine as the &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; of their generation - it is in good company . &quot;
these celebrities are not related to famous people or Reality stars or young people from today who know how to rot@@ ate a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if all that is true on Jen@@ ner ) .
they are truly talented women who exc@@ el in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once which appeared on the Last Cover with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade was one of the most successful years of her career .
&quot; of course , Jen@@ ners don &apos;t like success to everyone . &quot;
&quot; with her Reality TV story , Jen@@ ners &apos;s standing in the fashion world was always something tense . &quot;
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called them &quot; the m@@ ist@@ pieces of the moment . &quot;
these feelings squ@@ ad again high when the news came out with the appearance of Jen@@ ners on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but on the mis@@ wor@@ m@@ wood riding seems to be away at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
it runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your Grun@@ er of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell some pictures of their respective pay@@ roll apps .
you are sold by her made pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is in the Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
&quot; population centers show about 160@@ ,000 people each year . &quot;
&quot; more than 160@@ ,000 of the aid most vulnerable of the country are reported every year by the Common Assembly centres , while the industry is focused on the impact of further intermediate cuts to already over@@ sized transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Queensland , three of five persons - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations , and those with their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the community , which are already over@@ ly util@@ ised , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; from June next year , it is planned that these legal centers will lose additional 30 percent of their federal funding . &quot;
&quot; the director of the Joint Meeting of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Joint Meeting was revealed , that thousands of people had already rejected every year . &quot;
Far@@ rell said that the situation without the abolition of the German government would only become worse .
&quot; Queens@@ lands communities are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means thousands of people of important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and aff@@ licted debt , families who have been dis@@ missed by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems of legal kind and this survey reveals that they can not get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will be shortened by 30 percent in June 2017 , which means that thousands of helpl@@ ess@@ ly people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call on the General Secretary General and Federal Minister of Defence , as well as Sen@@ ators from Queensland George Bran@@ dis to raise these SMEs immediately so that people can get the help they need for legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the State Government met its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the municipal centres and their customer communities , as well as the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump of campaign charged after employee allegedly moved
&quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ umps campaign has been charged on alleged in@@ action due to alleged in@@ action , after it was told that their campaign manager for North Carolina was directed to a staff while in February in a je@@ ep . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment which was submitted on Wednesday at the State Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programming for the campaign in this federal state . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ordin@@ i gave up to have waited for monthly , that the matter would be regulated internally before he re@@ alises that &quot; that would not happen . &quot;
&quot; the campaign manager , Earl Philip , &apos; pulled a p@@ istol , placed his right for@@ ef@@ inger on the de@@ duction , and r@@ ammed the run in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; gave B@@ ordin@@ i in his charge . &quot;
&quot; after having compl@@ ained at the local and regional campaign guidance , B@@ ordin@@ i noted that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip had he had in the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause damage , &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i gave . &quot;
&quot; the indictment comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential election , as he said to a crowd of men in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment of people &quot; - should take action in case his Ri@@ val@@ in Hill@@ ary Clinton should be elected and judge . &quot;
&quot; the campaign was clear that the media would cr@@ acks his words from the context , and that he would not rise to violence . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ordin@@ is complaint requires compensation from the campaign for violation of duty of duty and of Philip because of bodily injury and abi@@ ding , spiritual damage . &quot;
Tr@@ umps Pres@@ ent in Hope Hi@@ cks wasn &apos;t able to reach an opinion .
&quot; attempts to contact Philip , just l@@ acked . &quot;
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news station in Charlotte , announces that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : pol@@ l before European elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; during the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , significant losses for government parties and CD@@ U are characterised by major losses . &quot;
this erg@@ ing representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; image &quot; -@@ Zeitung ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black governmental coalition in the north could hardly be ruled out in the north , this is not possible after the survey in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both Bundes@@ länder , the SPD would be the strongest party and therefore would have good chances to continue the lead of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD has risen from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent in five years prior to 24 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party sho@@ ok off just shortly before the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is controversial between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left came to 19 per cent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be present at 19 per cent for the first time in the country day . &quot;
the Greens hesit@@ ant despite mild losses with 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) again in the Schwer@@ in agricultural day .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented at 3 per cent in the country day .
&quot; according to the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ uties , the SPD of the survey was estimated that only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U now reached only 18 percent to 2@@ 3.4 per cent .
&quot; by doing so , they look behind the green with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Represent@@ atives .
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope to return to a return , the pirates would be missed in contrast to 2011 in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9@@ 000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and internet in Tim@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia communic@@ ator came to the market .
the successor dominate the world today - his producer experienced a disaster .
the device wei@@ ghed almost half a kilo@@ gram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thicker and larger , therefore it was not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite knock . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was initially eight me@@ gab@@ y@@ tes , which would range today for about two flas@@ hes with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes .
&quot; Nokia 9@@ 000 Communic@@ ator was born exactly 20 years ago , 15 August 1996 , the business and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few Euro , lovers can still buy the devices in the internet , but they come somehow from the St@@ one@@ age of the internet era . &quot;
but 20 years ago the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before at the Ce@@ BIT in Hanover as &quot; office in the west @-@ format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone was able to send standards a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator . &quot;
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML @-@ browsers if also agon@@ izing slowly .
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital addres@@ book and a electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be changed similar to a laptop . &quot;
then we found a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
&quot; the price was quite proud of the price : 2@@ 700 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was 2015 at 3@@ 92 euros .
nobody was able to guess in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
&quot; since then , everything is different . &quot;
&quot; smart phones are a success story , if not for Nokia . &quot;
&quot; the mobile de@@ mar@@ es of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft and handled . &quot;
&quot; today , the providers dominate the market , which were all a lot later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; always and everywhere online , this is today for a very many people &apos;s everyday life . &quot;
in 2015 there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
&quot; approximately 1,4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple have been sold alone 5@@ 55 million pieces . &quot;
&quot; worldwide sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the well @-@ running shops of the innum@@ erable app providers and the telecommunications companies come out . &quot;
around the smartphone has now developed an entire industry .
&quot; the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple Chef Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communication , easy to use with touch screen . &quot;
&quot; the winner of the Apple began , still today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market had the look . &quot;
&quot; eventually , you disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the sa@@ gen now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after his invention a matter of course .
&quot; in the cut , every German now looks for 88 times a day on his cell phone . &quot;
&quot; we must all learn to set the smartphone once again , &quot; said Jan@@ ina sphere , in the Siemens @-@ Board of Staff . &quot;
continuous accessibility is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the olymp@@ ic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will not only get into our local commun@@ es and in London but throughout the country renewal and prosperity .
&quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just as in 2012 in London , as we have a great deal of effort to make sure all of our nations and regions benefited by the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad made great advantages for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
this will be reached by offering new opportunities for local and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; for our local communities , we will already employ 10,000 new teachers , 40,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment at the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead in London in 2012 , there will be such people who are thinking that the challenge of enlargement He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too great . &quot;
I told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we are bl@@ aming on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had been wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to wind@@ winds but He@@ a@@ throw answers any question asked .
as the Olympic Games is He@@ a@@ throw for many and not for single infrastructure project .
&quot; enlargement is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion in funny growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and throughout the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has been implemented a £ 11 bn of infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal was built up to T@@ 2 , which was in the middle of the two frequencies of the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment . &quot;
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the He@@ a@@ throw extension will also be one of them .
it is time that we direct and He@@ a@@ throw this Olympic spirit as well as ensuring our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment to which England can be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; K@@ atz @-@ and Maus@@ te@@ Game &quot; &quot; regarding display block &quot;
&quot; for companies , who will earn money with Online@@ advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to deal with display block , a &quot; &quot; cat and mouse play &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block displaying results on his desktop , published Ad@@ block Plus a blo@@ gger in which it hur@@ led to users to block its filters in the program to re@@ block advertising in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday Facebook with that his Des@@ k@@ top@@ side would change the co@@ ding on his advertising display , in order to detect it indicator on which part of the page advertising is to ag@@ grav@@ ate . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to deal with new codes .
&quot; in a blo@@ gger , the spokes@@ man on Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er @-@ battle between the an@@ zei@@ ting open source community and the h@@ ackers have already been underway since the invention of ad @-@ lock@@ ers in progress &quot; , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook is soon coming with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest company for social media has been introduced into battle , is a strong indi@@ z for how worrying ad signs for the industry have become . &quot;
&quot; according to a study conducted by Pa@@ j@@ air and Adobe about 200 million people worldwide , according to a survey ; almost four times as much 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1,@@ 03 billion daily users who access Facebook via their mobile devices makes hand @-@ up 84 per cent of the advertising features . &quot;
&quot; the company has an ad block on desktop PCs except for mobile display block , he has no effect on Fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agram , shared a speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient large proportion of revenue , so Facebook appears to be the investment of such a step as rewarding . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared with that it would update his &quot; &quot; indication &quot; &quot; tool to have more control over it &apos;s advertising . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook announced that Ad@@ block would be worrying for new filters because they would also block content on the page that are no advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , shared a subject of Facebook in an e @-@ mail message . &quot;
&quot; ad documents are a bl@@ unt remedy , which is why we concentrated on the development tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , in order to put more control into the hands of the people . &quot;
woman to over@@ ride on Swiss highway on Swiss highway
the victim was right in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police are witnesses to witness after a woman in the early hours of the morning on Thursday with suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred at the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman laid down in the dark &quot; &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; &quot; on the streets and were hit by several cars , the police in V@@ aud said . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a silence at the age of 49 years , one of several vehicles , including a truck , was transferred to kill himself . &quot;
it still died on site .
&quot; several drivers have been heard already , but some are still not identified , said the police , who calls them as well as every witness of the incident . &quot;
&quot; it was opened an investigation process , which is a &quot; log@@ istical &quot; step in such a situation , divided Gilles Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gene@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown . &quot;
was a clash avoidable ?
&quot; this is something that the pro@@ secutor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years have shown that the drivers are not held accountable .
in each of the two cases - when a person ran in the dark on the free@@ way - was decided that drivers don &apos;t have to assume that a pedestrian in the middle of the night runs as it was mentioned in the newspaper .
&quot; last year , a poli@@ cem@@ an of the neg@@ ligence has been acqu@@ itted after they had over@@ ride a man and killed that in August 2014 was one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had dr@@ unken , and has become unconscious on the road , took the court . &quot;
&quot; the court decided that the poli@@ cem@@ an -- which had responded to an emergency response -- on an justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road was an &quot; absolutely extraordinary and unfor@@ es@@ ee@@ able situation &quot; , &quot; the judge said . &quot;
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges was to report to the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 44 .
NASA Klim@@ am@@ od@@ ell : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
&quot; according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was most likely to be inhab@@ itable . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate research .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , waterproof surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere was once noted . &quot;
scientists have previously indicated that the long @-@ turn of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , a similar atmosphere and still slow down . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably proved to be more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and be protected from faster ev@@ ap@@ oration . &quot;
the early Venus prof@@ ited also from a sun that was 30 percent less .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS modeling simul@@ ating the slow turn of Venus its day @-@ side of the sun almost two months long , &quot; G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io stated in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this heated the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer clouds , which affects the surface of a large proportion of the sun war@@ ms . &quot;
the result is average @-@ temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today .
&quot; the model brought forth a story of Venus , which was similar to evolution that has previously been suspected of planetary research . &quot;
&quot; although it was once believed to be inhab@@ itable , Venus -- in the course of several billion years , was exposed to a lot of heat and ultra@@ violet light . &quot;
her oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and her water vap@@ our was burned down by the ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as its hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide stayed back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which as we know it today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy is coming back as a coach of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a low contribution to the decision @-@ making process of the team .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately search for a new coach . &quot;
&quot; over the past three years , I have met my duties as chief trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations , the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; &quot; said the 50 year of Roy in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; over the course of the summer I have been thinking about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , this requires and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the trainer &apos;s vision and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly adapted to the organisation &apos;s organisation . &quot;
he must also have a determination of decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not fulfilled .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had an@@ ed in Roy on 23 May 2013 , than@@ ked him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick has informed me about this decision , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we all appreciate what he did for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy has been awarded the Best trainer of the League during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
&quot; he led the association to 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed the season in each of the last two years . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches marked in the season 2015 @-@ 16 a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference around five points .
&quot; as Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart , Roy has won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che . &quot;
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ ler will resume talks again
&quot; the work struggles relating to the compensation for Nord@@ se@@ e@@ oil workers will be exposed , while all dispute parties for a new round round at the table , they said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
strikes against the oil field service providers Wood Group were spor@@ adic@@ ally carried out on platforms in the North Sea which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ites and r@@ ammed unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of current dispute , &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot;
&quot; we will hold some full @-@ day meetings in the coming weeks , which will start the beginning of next year to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , a protest against possible wage cuts from up to 30 percent . &quot;
wood Group has shortened this year to its contracts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s ac@@ ron@@ ym follows a 10 % drop rate for on@@ shore clients in 2014 .
&quot; the company said that additional cuts in the company gives the needed space to get through the market down@@ turn . &quot;
&quot; Shell has released for its part of thousands of people and announced plans to release his oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it is ration@@ alized his business activities as a result of his me@@ at@@ ant collaboration with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation resulting from the decision of the British in June to the European Union . &quot;
the Scottish parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the largest working disputes which has been in the North Sea since a generation in the North Sea .
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy that works for many and not just a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1,4 billion spent on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of about $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures rotation rate of stars in the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
&quot; the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ z@@ tel@@ escope has helped a@@ stron@@ aut , to collect the full catalogue of rotation under the stars of the star enh@@ ancer of the P@@ lei@@ ades . &quot;
&quot; the new data will help to understand the astronom@@ ers , why stars in the cluster could be rotating in different racks as well as in the context of rotation periods with the planetary genesis . &quot;
&quot; we hope that we read through the comparisons of our results with other constell@@ ations , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the P@@ lei@@ ades of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light@@ years from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this cluster , which were created approximately 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ thood . &quot;
they are now turning the fastest .
&quot; at peak rates , these gri@@ pping stars encounter large amounts of d@@ wind@@ les . &quot;
&quot; because these winds are travelling through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; if a star is age , his rot@@ ational rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a discer@@ ni@@ ble star -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates pointed out that more massive stars are slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compares the stars with dancers while bigger stars slower Pi@@ rou@@ ettes as smaller .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors will tend to be massive , whereas red rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the star @-@ pile of the Ple@@ j@@ aden is so close , it serves as an ideal kos@@ her laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ lei@@ ades of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; it is still far ahead of us to learn more about how the How , when and why stars can slow their rotation rates and speak their &quot; dance gloves . &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in three newspaper articles about their latest analysis of the ple@@ ural rates of the Ple@@ j@@ ades who will soon appear in the A@@ stronom@@ ical Journal .

&quot; with Hall @-@ of Fame @-@ Fame H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie M@@ ays , only two other bas@@ eball players show similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be recorded in the rest of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls . &quot;
because so successful Rodri@@ guez - nickname &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - in the field was so controversial is its appearance outside the place .
&quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; was launched between 2001 and 2003 . &quot;
in August 2013 he was locked in the so @-@ called Bio@@ diversity scandal until the end of 2014 for 2@@ 11 games .
Rodri@@ guez is considered the main da@@ unting for years to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in South @-@ Florida @-@ promoting means .
&quot; after a dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters . &quot;
&quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I have played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ guez said . &quot;
also his farewell days are not going to be no@@ is@@ eless .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends in their last games still get the big stage , Rodri@@ guez had to sit frequently on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour , &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; ätz@@ er Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married with the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress Kate Hudson said , sympathy agreements of the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e arch@@ ri@@ v@@ al Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa and Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski are the first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , wei@@ ght@@ the@@ ber Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski from Poland must not start from Poland in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be overs@@ ha@@ do@@ wed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
a bl@@ iss@@ ful athle@@ te could have gained almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing cases are known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
the Chinese s@@ atin in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacles in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ the@@ bers Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski have been positive in Brazil and excluded - immediately prior to the onset of the already critical ir@@ cul@@ mination cont@@ ests , these messages come about time . &quot;
&quot; at Ch@@ en has been proven the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ othi@@ azi@@ de last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ hing instrument for dop@@ ing instances . &quot;
the International Sport@@ Court CA@@ S held on Friday afternoon local time with expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final over 100 m butter@@ fly , just around 0.@@ 09 seconds , she missed the bronze medals . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en should have participated in the prec@@ urs@@ ors of over 50 m of Fre@@ isti@@ l . &quot;
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B @-@ trial at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; the national association take the matter &quot; very serious and demanded of Ch@@ en &apos;s full cooperation in investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua out of a communication : &quot; we will work with the International Sport@@ Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S responsible for the san@@ itation of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio se@@ ep@@ ed the message about the positive specimen at Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa by , the 33 @-@ year @-@ olds ran into the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she told the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it is innocent , &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements &quot; , &quot; explained the athle@@ tics of the body . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is intended to act at the forbidden substance of the EP@@ O &apos; blood @-@ offering . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa was provisional , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should already be already positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w met immediately with criticism of the athle@@ te &apos;s word .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot;
&quot; thus , approximately all weights from the chron@@ ically @-@ dop@@ ing nation may not take part in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday also the case &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski &quot; , &quot; the London Olympics in the class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier on the an@@ ole ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both deny the intake , both may not start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the start of the athle@@ tics , it is especially the case Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa a further severe blow to the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the World Association IA@@ AF had banned the complete Russian team to an exception for systematic dop@@ ing the start , even the L@@ ent nation Kenya produced in Rio numerous bad news . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming pool , the former associations in China had also taken care of fierce debates between athletes . &quot;
thus the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympi@@ ad Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la , &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m of Fre@@ isti@@ l , I want to pass , &quot; &quot; H@@ our@@ t said in the French radio . &quot;
&quot; in addition , sun was the focus of a confrontation with the Australi@@ ans M@@ ack Hor@@ ton . &quot;
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing che@@ ers , &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; sun was positive in 2014 with Chinese champi@@ onships , but had to be tested only a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
data kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ presses their ran@@ som
programmer from compres@@ sor mal@@ ware currently rely on targeted companies - and they are successful .
&quot; according to a current survey of the mal@@ ware of mal@@ ware experts Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes under 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany were 40 percent of the surve@@ yed companies in the past twelve months at least once , partly several victims of an attack with black@@ smith software . &quot;
in Germany almost 20 percent of firms were already aiming at a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 per cent of victims paid by the perpetrators demanded by the perpetrators to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpetrators speci@@ alize their ex@@ tor@@ ser software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attack in company networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potentially explosive ran@@ som is considerably higher than with private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of damage , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ e programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the offen@@ ders discovered software for himself .
&quot; only private users were the target , but the change to company att@@ acken took place start@@ ling quickly in the past months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware is working after a simple pattern : once on the computer a victim , it looks specifically for un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als lasting .
then the software presents the demands of the black@@ smith .
&quot; to get the final turn@@ key code to the files , the victims need money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ graphic Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where private users use the personal Photo database on the game , it is important for companies with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production stops . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage is due when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the affected German firms by ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to break down the business , in a case , people were aware of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals were victims of attacks , whose patients may be threatened by the loss of medical actors . &quot;
&quot; we say the victims always : pays not , you therefore only promote the problem , &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data back . &quot;
&quot; for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of perpetrators , given by stal@@ em@@ ate in the operation . &quot;
the h@@ ackers again know that and try to build up a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure the utility finishes and contact with black@@ mail@@ ers examined and come to the result : the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their sacrifices by chat , how they can pay per Bit@@ coin , set free accessible support sites or de@@ code for example files . &quot;
&quot; and if private people sol@@ ves to payments of few hundreds of euros , companies need to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums up to retrieve their data . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ acker will always be professional and share the work , explains safety experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from Anti@@ virus @-@ provider Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware around within a week . &quot;
&quot; more likely , it is likely that it is three or four people . &quot;
the programmers sell their contam@@ in@@ ants then in the form of a software building to the actual black@@ smith .
&quot; the previous mal@@ ware kits were created by the mal@@ ware itself , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars were purchased . &quot;
&quot; included is a adap@@ tive tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ ma@@ ins then look for more h@@ ackers in order to spread the fresh software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so you log in one of the forums in the underground , buy the set of a criminal and asked for another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
the payment is processed per in@@ consistent machine .
&quot; usually the criminals then carry a sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
Ran@@ som@@ ware &apos;s risk is now known to many companies that secure their data better .
more than 50 percent of companies in the company @-@ IT leaders have confidence in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware using file @-@ back @-@ ups and Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful testing , the perpetrators will instead be explained with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing ations , &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; with this , the damage potential is still much higher depending on the type of data . &quot;
&quot; also , the perpetrators could continue to take completely new goals on the internet of things . &quot;
on the Hack@@ ney Conference De@@ con demonstrated security researchers how they could get an associated thermo@@ stat on their control .
&quot; in the middle of winter , the activation of such a block heating is definitely worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ator then instead of heating in the future are blocking a whole production road in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be an issue in industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday @-@ du@@ sty
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V Honda will un@@ pack everything : a little S@@ UV , a little cou@@ p@@ é , and also the versatility of a mini@@ vans . &quot;
&quot; sounds rather un@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although that only 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V rather small , the passengers have a lot in the first row as well as in the F@@ ond . there is no place in any place . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ top is there anything . &quot;
versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V during storage space .
&quot; it is not just a trunk of 4@@ 53 l at high @-@ established and 10@@ 26 l with cl@@ oned back @-@ rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical , as it sounds : the seats of the back bank can be up@@ loaded and thus offer storage space , which is from the ground up to the ceiling 1.@@ 24 m high . &quot;
&quot; the trunk is well ventil@@ ated , but the load height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot in 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1,6 @-@ l @-@ diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide torque areas very powerful .
&quot; however , he should do something qui@@ eter for his work . &quot;
&quot; we are pleasing , the everyday use of 4.7 l / 100 km . &quot;
there is still another mot@@ ori@@ zation : a 1.5 @-@ l gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 HP .
an all @-@ pac@@ ed drive is not offered .
&quot; the driving behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering is likely to be a little more direct .
the facilities in the tested top variant &quot; Executive &quot; does not allow any wishes to be desired .
&quot; among the security systems , the City @-@ Not@@ bra@@ king assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the coll@@ isions @-@ system and the run@@ way super@@ visor . &quot;
&quot; the coll@@ isions are irrit@@ ated , sometimes because he assessed many obstacles as &quot; her@@ bi@@ ased objects . &quot; &quot;
very reliable works of the remote @-@ job super@@ visor .
and the intelligent tempor@@ eg@@ ler respon@@ ds to the traffic signs and d@@ ros@@ ine on demand the speed .
&quot; the full connectivity is however only available for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and More . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI cable lie under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat awk@@ ward .
the around 29@@ 000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
&quot; who does not want to invest so much , receives the gasoline from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel starting from 2@@ 3000 euros . &quot;
the engines meet the Euro @-@ 6 @-@ emission standard .
Honda with the HR @-@ V offers a versatile and everyday @-@ du@@ sty car .
Air@@ line does not apply : fall on air@@ ship bridge
Air@@ line is not liable for the overthrow of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
&quot; for a liability is conceivable only with dangers that are typical of air traffic , argued the Upper Government of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken down in the fall of a knee squ@@ ash .
&quot; however , the accident could have been possible everywhere - it handy for a general risk of life , such as judgment . &quot;
the airline had to pay no damage to the man .
disease cases : when paid the organizer
sick holiday@@ makers will only get money back after their trip if the cause of the disease is doubt@@ lessly found in the hotel .
&quot; this , however , is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the united case , a family was severely ill in diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting a family on the second day of their door . &quot;
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
their disease led the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a defective se@@ wage plant that supposedly had poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
&quot; the family was the view , the journey was not a lack of attention - and mour@@ ned against the organizer . &quot;
in court the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had no success .
although the se@@ wage plant was in fact broken .
but the organizer just drove just before the departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to assume until then that sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; he did not hurt his information , so the judgment . &quot;
especially since in the samples of the water no pollution have been found .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by infection with each other - belonging to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 diagnosed .
&quot; said de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , following the violence perpetr@@ ated by refugees in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people had their concern for further attacks . &quot;
the state had to be held and determined at the same time to terror at the same time .
sure : our country will not be able to answer the power of perpetrators with hatred and division .
&quot; this triumph , we will not treat the terrorists . &quot;
&quot; if the offen@@ ders had to leave the country faster , but the level of security and strength are also the approval of the people for refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of proposals up to the Bundestag in 2017 .
&quot; he also announced another personnel rein@@ forcement of the security forces , and in the middle of medium size over several years . &quot;
sympath@@ iz@@ ations for terrorism must be under punishment .
&quot; video surveillance is to be improved , the weapon to be so balanced so that especially the purchase of weapons in the internet is complicated . &quot;
the last much discussed welding for doctors should be maintained following de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
&quot; however , in dialogue with the English @-@ tes@@ ters , he wants to search for solutions like the threat of citizens could be reduced , he said with a view of about mental abnorm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to counter@@ act a radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister maintains a better social support for it . &quot;
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ sed people .
&quot; for persecution of criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of investig@@ ator investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD boss Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security further . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister of Interior has clearly defined against shareholders . &quot;
&quot; that was one ear @-@ flock for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; said Gabriel the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ ator ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union after an Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double citizenship earlier .
it is a generic ban on the enforcement of the enforcement of a constitu@@ tionally problematic .
&quot; one cannot for@@ bid everything that you reject , and I refused to carry the bur@@ ka . &quot;
you could talk about rules about traffic or witnesses before judgment .
&quot; green @-@ Chief in Simone Peter threw the Minister , he wants to simul@@ ate with ever new anti @-@ terror par@@ asi@@ veness and re@@ vi@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; left @-@ party manager Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said , &quot; &quot; Fle@@ ü@@ che and a ti@@ ghtening of the common right bring man no more security in this country . &quot;
better traffic @-@ flow on the motorway exit
it looks regularly on the envelope - here a picture of November .
&quot; however , that is to change : the legal ab@@ uses must be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is good news for all the drivers , who are in the traffic road at the ambient road every evening in the traffic jam , when they drive over the highway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the near Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the hammer street and the exit Wes@@ eler road , the right lane lane is 700 meters . &quot;
drivers can then turn right from the hammer street to the right .
&quot; the great advantage : the traffic will early in , thus improving the overall execution on the complex section of the federal road 51 . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of the University of Münster .
the driving distance on the bro@@ ker is nervous from above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; week@@ days , the back @-@ back ranges from the road to the bridge over the Alber@@ Sloven@@ her path and sometimes also beyond . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the needle @-@ watch is on the B 51 shortly before the V@@ est street . &quot;
&quot; from here , traffic is only guided on the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second lane had to be re@@ built in a quarter of years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had revealed that the bridge is no longer the required force , in order to take above all the heavy traffic @-@ traffic . &quot;
&quot; how long this bot@@ t@@ pass and the associated working day St@@ au is last , the responsible country can not be said . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to calculate : for the bridge has an official remainder of the period up to the year 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal vacuum , the country is deliberately selected the traffic @-@ weaker time in the school holidays because with disabilities is expected . &quot;
the traffic will be guided on the site on Tuesday and Wednesday at the site .
cross @-@ cultural journey : cultural offers for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the plays &apos; The invisible house . &quot;
the Association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a musical project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
the &quot; class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has attended a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The invisible house &quot; of the boy Theatre of Münster .
&quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; &quot; visited 19 students between eleven and 15 years of staging in the little house . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which has set itself the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background to the aim of visiting schools with welcome classes , as part of this project cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; most of the youth of the class were between September 2015 and March 2016 among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster , and say little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the s@@ zen@@ ical pictures and video anim@@ ations it had been possible to follow the course of action , so the press release of the boy Theatre Theatre . &quot;
&quot; the Association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wester@@ berg in Language , and the Young Theater will work together in the upcoming season within the framework of a musical development project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , young people with and without escape and immigration background between 14 and 20 years are given the opportunity to visit professionally managed courses in the fields of singing , dance , spectacle and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the@@ atri@@ cal play and the@@ atri@@ cal language identification are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; continues .
&quot; given the increasing refugee numbers , the association counts with many classes who want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of star@@ ving : hope of weather
the weather has made the star@@ ving ri@@ bs at the south @-@ west of Germany on the night to Friday a stop@@ over by the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was bad for clouds and rain badly for watching the spectacle of spectacle , the chair of the observatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather is supposed to be good , then we definitely see many star @-@ sn@@ aps at the sky . &quot;
&quot; the cluster is per@@ tin@@ den , which belong to the fastest star with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; they have their names , because they apparently come from the constellation of Per@@ se@@ us , which is in the northeast . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evening , one fell etern@@ ally awake , at night the time is up for hours , in the morning there is much more to think about sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , you have such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch @-@ Institut , about a quarter of adults are sleeping disorders and more than ten percent experience their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing . &quot;
how are sleeping problems or sleeping disorders ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleeping disorders , and there can be diverse causes underlying them , says Hans @-@ Günter We@@ ar , Board member of the German Society for sleeping research and sleeping medicine . &quot;
&quot; what you understand by them is , but the In@@ som@@ nie is , so an input and a sle@@ der@@ ous disorder . &quot;
&quot; just sleep many people feel as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , Board member of the German house association with practice in the German @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleeping disorders are complex .
&quot; they can also be organic , mental or obs@@ essive @-@ conditional factors , but also drugs . &quot;
not rarely is the in@@ toxic@@ ation expression of another disorder .
&quot; very early waking up is mostly in depression common , &quot; says We@@ ar . &quot;
and it can be that various factors are than@@ ised one another .
&quot; who for instance has a sli@@ pped disk , can be bad , watch every two to three hours and begins to greet , about everyday problems and worries , We@@ ar is an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should one go to the doctor with sleeping disorders to the doctor ?
&quot; who is not well asleep for a period of one month at least three nights per week and the day is imp@@ aired , should go to the doctor , betra@@ ying We@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; impairment can be quite different : it is tired , tired , un@@ exhausted , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has m@@ oods or bodily ail@@ ments such as stomach or headaches . &quot;
&quot; to allevi@@ ate the in@@ toxic@@ ation , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; as a treatment options , among other things , behaviour change , a cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or even medicines - classical sleeping tables only in exceptional cases and no more than two weeks . &quot;
&quot; in Germany there are hardly anything in Germany , Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary medical center at the Char@@ ité University Medical Center Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one should immediately turn to the physician first at bed@@ time , reveals We@@ ar . &quot;
it can clarify with investigations as to whether the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who was to go to sleep laboratory , and what happens there ? &quot;
&quot; for examination in the dormit@@ ories of medical doctors , for example in snoring with respiratory plac@@ ements , with illness @-@ effective day @-@ fatigue , at bed@@ time , or if you find the cause of a sle@@ der@@ ous disorder , nothing is explained . &quot;
one does not have to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make a lunch , &quot; says Fi@@ ghter . &quot;
&quot; after glu@@ ing , one gets to the bed of his normal time . &quot;
&quot; besides the electro@@ des on the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a anten@@ na@@ e at the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera marks the ceiling to the sleeping place . &quot;
how can sufferers be able to get a grip on ?
&quot; there are quite a lot of pitch , where you can put a better sleep . &quot;
&quot; wo@@ e counts on : regular bed@@ time and rise @-@ times , not too long in bed , not to sleep far in bed , do not watch TV to sleep , alcohol , and night at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is absolutely not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself by Facebook to appoint the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he held the first gold medal at the shor@@ eline at the first time in Doha and presented his first world record at the same time . &quot;
now the former DS@@ V athle@@ te Markus Dei@@ bler has placed himself by Facebook protective by his in the criticism of the ex @-@ team @-@ mates .

airport : arrested by : ban@@ ces of baggage
professional th@@ iev@@ es at the airport of Düsseldorf
&quot; civil servants , the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police arrested the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years on Thursday . &quot;
the ab@@ err@@ ation had been committed as ban@@ ces several hand@@ bags and baggage allowance .
&quot; at 9@@ 30 p.m. , civil servants in the area of the airport Düsseldorf a gang again , which was known to the poli@@ cem@@ an from past theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the mid @-@ July of this year , and were very collaborative , working and particularly professional . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the crime Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ate 34 may have travelled to the th@@ iev@@ es , who had traveled to Germany for the detention of crimes in Germany , four acts . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , they exploited a total of more than 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; the Rig@@ a@@ ean street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in looks at the first glance not so , but the police are one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; walk along the road from east to west , one gets along the places , a fres@@ her nursery and a bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
on the facade of a gray house someone has &quot; ugly ! &quot; sc@@ at@@ oned .
&quot; opposite one Li@@ d@@ l , which is to be demol@@ ished also soon , it is already built : until 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new flats . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the responsible property company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in calls , are preferred in recent weeks with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; reason the house is occupied with the number 94 : once it was occupied , the inhabitants of the lease , on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Berlin sen@@ ator Hen@@ kel had been advoc@@ ated several times since the beginning of the year for a hard action of the police against the project , the region referred to as &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for poli@@ c@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ iede , with 300 police officers , pat@@ ched the police three weeks long , pat@@ ched parts of the road and held visitors away from entering the house with the number 94 . &quot;
meanwhile renovated construction workers on behalf of the un@@ familiar home@@ owners the rooms .
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers went down by sympath@@ isers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the road works peace@@ fully : parents go with children , people sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking vor@@ m sp@@ ät@@ i . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
&quot; left violence is not the main plaza of many inhabitants : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kiev since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who runs here three children , mainly by the police presence of gener@@ v@@ t . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the inhabitants of the domestic projects , they share the concern for increasing rents and b@@ umps . &quot;
it does not sound like a p@@ ines who would like multi@@ disciplinary police protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ an left .
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin internal interior and the police between house @-@ occupied and their neighbours , does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class , which also has a lower average level in comparison to the rest of the city and has high poverty risk . &quot;
&quot; also house@@ holders and the native native projects belong already long to the P@@ ine@@ z : 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost all the entire Main@@ zer street near the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer was vac@@ ated under great police officers in a down@@ right street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district in recent years has become increasingly becoming the magne@@ ts for tourists and constitu@@ ents from all over the world : with them now they share their inhabitants from the GDR and former household occupied their p@@ ines . &quot;
this also has been noticeable in the rents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the newly built structures in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes it in con@@ gest@@ ed discs or freshly harvested fac@@ ades that were ej@@ ected with color .
&quot; no other street was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one reason that not all neighbours could see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as bodily injury , statistics are estimated almost exclusively against poli@@ c@@ emen . &quot;
most of the crimes are made of damage which ten@@ don &apos;t make the newly built and newly renovated homes .
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lived in a flat house next to the controversial 94 years , there will be no talk of insecurity . &quot;
&quot; concerning violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours , they don &apos;t have been . &quot;
even the famous burning cars give it directly in the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
&quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal point , on the contrary : &quot; &quot; here you can help each other , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drawn into the Rig@@ a@@ er Street - and stayed .
&quot; therefore , it was also so important that the inhabitants get back their street : from the police , politics and the media , all of which suddenly claimed the interpretation of the city in July . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of women like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to be taken away : by ste@@ pl@@ ess new constructions in former buildings , which sup@@ press the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are ultimately the property apartments , which are not interesting for many here - here are more people living not so well located &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction can I absolutely no harm . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but what should one do , if one never hear somebody ? &quot;
&quot; it sets frustration at all sides , even in the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; for the du@@ sty , who like more about colour bom@@ bas@@ kets , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the pine . &quot;
&quot; who moves , should be aware of it - just like someone who moves to a pub , who can &apos;t complain about noise . &quot;
all persons presented with pre @-@ names have therefore asked not to be named with their correct name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organizer .
&quot; furthermore , it is a social job on the spot . &quot;
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le the refugee Agency for Ur@@ bach .
the social pedago@@ gin supports the team of management around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berg .
&quot; she sees itself as a contact partner for all players : refugees , working group refugee , administration , authorities and who else are involved . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customers of the working group indicates that the volunteers are now more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ vers of wool @-@ mil@@ k@@ sau , which above all have a problem . &quot;
&quot; so , some - less mo@@ cking than on the multitude of tasks desired , meant - meant , as the administration wanted to write the place . &quot;
&quot; was searched for an administrative work with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an aff@@ led wool sau . &quot;
&quot; however , administrative work is not their central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with the local people and also behind the scenes as well as networking activity . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been involved in the course of around six weeks .
it has a 50 percent spot on three years of time .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le hon@@ ors and full @-@ time actors are supported . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small issues , organizational , human and insur@@ g@@ ations . &quot;
soon new containers are available in the washing road
a serious problem is it for some time to find apartments for the Connec@@ tions which have been recognized .
the commun@@ es are responsible for the connection .
you need to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented residential areas .
&quot; the cost of construction , rent or renov@@ ations of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the Council office to the Commune and job center .
problem : there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been designed for some time as very difficult .
de facto the administration does not find private apartments .
&quot; so far it is not working , you should rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common apartments must be viewed as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers are placed in the washing road .
but only with apartments is not done .
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine Customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a firm lead , it is tra@@ ine@@ eship , training places , educational sites , a @-@ euro @-@ jobs and off@@ ences for refugees and migrants that have to be put or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help domestic , do non @-@ profit work - and this motiv@@ ates and very neat , such as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community to play a positive impact .
&quot; that is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not mean work .
&quot; the day need a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a lack of taste .
&quot; so , we need offers such as sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
so you can also jump in managing and volunteer .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; you need to explain the refugees that it takes time and can make it reasonable for the time , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who will develop the feeling at some point , he could not help in Ur@@ bach anyone who do not work and be useless , he will never integrate . &quot;
the marked majority is motivated .
&quot; there is also , however , the customer is honest , &quot; people , where nothing works . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and the customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : did the two pre@@ tend fear of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer very clearly , &quot; &quot; what some sort of it might be naive . &quot; &quot; a res@@ tr@@ isi@@ ko could and if it doesn &apos;t want to exclude them . &quot;
&quot; sensi@@ ti@@ zes , the hel@@ per is already . &quot;
these incidents also be subject to refugees .
that would have the fear of bringing the attacks completely into obli@@ ging .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; so , main and volunteers must keep on site and in the region according to activities . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they always have in the background that soon a new push of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach . &quot;
does Germany need a cap ?
the question is clear to answer this question .
&quot; actually , it is unfair to place it on site . &quot;
&quot; we have not arrived in Ur@@ bach where we would like to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
no new refugees would let the situation relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also clearly makes the fact that the Ur@@ bacher shall also be fully util@@ ised to integrate the hitherto people .
&quot; this is currently around 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political situation is so complicated , there is no easy answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bi@@ dding with helicop@@ ters
the police helicopter flew off different areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men are rolled by Friday at 8.@@ 50 o &apos;clock in an apartment in an apartment house in Lin@@ den@@ weg .
the inhabitants surprised both the two and struck the sh@@ hol@@ de in the escape .
&quot; the two men were approximately 1,@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters large , probably mas@@ hed , both Blue@@ jeans and black cap@@ u@@ zen@@ lis . &quot;
they are heading towards downtown .
&quot; for mu@@ te , the police put several stri@@ ps and a police helicopter . &quot;
the flag@@ ging ran without success .
the unknown was indeed close to the apartment or at their run .
