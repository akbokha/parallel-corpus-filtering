<seg id="12">This was the first time in Aachen and also at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports team handed over the man from Anhausen within the framework of a small Gala on the Golden Sportpyramide.</seg>
<seg id="15">In awards it lacks the sympathetic athlete.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clin's and Trumps economic policies compared: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the Trade Agreement of TTP - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"unone are the two US presidential elections, however, in tax and energy policy, as well as in a basic demand."</seg>
<seg id="4">"differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a basic, more philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">That is the role of the State.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small, warning about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to mourn the economy and regulate the economy he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">"himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, claims Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he will firmly reboot regulators, and makes it strong for a wide-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton said against it: the state has certain tasks to fulfill, he has disadvantaged chances and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, the taxes for the rich would increase, says it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the need to be invested, Trump and Clinton will say almost to the same."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic assessment at all announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Tewary-wing of Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in Trump, there could be a partial internal discussion."</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive coal mining in the US again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil funding should also be possible in so far protected areas to announce the Paris climate protection agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in contrast, Clinton wants to strengthen and call for renewable energies with their investment program:" a country will create the Clean energies and create millions of jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only in infrastructure - also at international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazide trade agreement, both want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both the US does not want to isolate the US by international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">The should then be paid better then for instance Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollar is a hunger.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it on 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump will do in this question is not quite clear: once he says, The minimum wage must be up, then he says he should not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics keep him before, that the budget deficit would only be greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton is standing at least from the rich, that they pay more taxes and their critics say, more taxes are not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="2">"sexual violence is part of women who flee alone, almost for everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>

<seg id="12">The scene works normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it is the business leader of Condrobs, a carrier for social aid offerings in Bavaria, and deals among other things with the subject of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are pouldering.</seg>
<seg id="16">"they live in the Munich North, in one of the few decentralised accommodations for all-fledged women and their children in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs made up the facility together with Pro family and Munich's commissioner."</seg>
<seg id="18">"recently, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">"60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children."</seg>
<seg id="20">Men do not exist - also not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a watchman in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggeration to say: every woman being here, has made her flight experience with sexual violence," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee for wars because they are prosecuted politically because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them as a hope of hope to Europe", "she tells."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women are outweigh other reasons for the escape:" "many steal themselves secretly, because they do not see any other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their homeland they have made experience of sexual violence, forced marriages, honorary morals, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">It drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tugs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is no rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"and the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end as soon as they anchor in Germany, irre, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"even here, common women in refugees would often be regarded as inferior and worse."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to that about 90 percent of women living in Munich's property, traumatized in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntary." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so familiar that they have nothing to say.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they often don't want to cure, there are more accommodations only for them, demands Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven districts are responsible for the accommodation of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question, whether they are using a similar project like in Munich in its jurisdiction, answer some with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Upper Palatinate and Oberfranken, there are such a thing in the governments of the governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"also in Schwaben, alone women are not accommodated alone, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, Pressesprecher of the Government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Oberbayern, Lower and Mittelfranken there are some common shelters or own houses for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the" "rights of women and gender equality" "in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommodated separately by men."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published by the Committee, it is said:" it is very important that men and women are separated. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if privacy or women and women are accommodated together, it may take to - constant - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"especially the washing rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women, standing in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women feel misunderstanding of this protection, you can read the dungeons coming to the house in Munich."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight months long-lasting war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gold hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, at the reception of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot repel the intrusion that Ankara wants most."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile worked at the smile, and he barely healed warmth, even for its back-in-time conditions."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeated by his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report full of five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day described a newspaper that Erdogan would have heard so much as if never had something worse.</seg>
<seg id="11">I seemed to give my enthusiasm rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin-radiant, sustainable cooling showed that the Russian President of Russia had forgotten nothing."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his quotes: the sealing of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was wutated.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara to please Russia in his back.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the race was even bigger, since it was committed by a supposed friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">Penetration again will be difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"months long, the public controlled media led a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at one time, it seemed like the Turks to blame for everything."</seg>
<seg id="21">"most serious about the accusations of senior officials, that Erdogan's own family from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria would have benefited from the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St.Petersburg the official message was allowed, that it was time to look ahead."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from the President Erdogan that he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan primarily requires all the friends he can get after he was at a failed coup almost his counterpart.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have made Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that are usually carried out several million Russian tourists each year to the Turkish coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia travel operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">It will count on a late seasonal onslaught on the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week anticipates the television reasonably priced fruits and vegetables, as soon as the Turkish agrarian imported goods are allowed again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti discussed it as follows:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious to the West as it was in response to the tried of power-taking than weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the ongoing groupll of the EU accession negotiations and Putin has - the pivotal to move out of the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"the Russian leader in Ankara won a bonus in Ankara that after the attempted coup, I demanded support for the elected government bodies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is well-known for Moscow, a matter of course, which itself has a profound fear of regimechange."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this gloss palace made it possible for Russia and Turkey, one as it was a analyst once described," alliance of outsiders ": two countries that are rejected and poorly treated by the West and are now emerging."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the largest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support antagonistic sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be indicative that after nearly three hours of initial discussions both Presidents said at the press conference, they did not even understand the subject."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey envisibly relied on a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after a few months of open hostilities - and considering the potential for a perfect disaster, when the NATO member of Turkey enters the Russian battle-jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State had at least one another."</seg>

<seg id="8">"in 1972 at the Estonian capital Tallinn, he made his mark at the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the Kremlin's website, it means (in Russian) that he later was a protocol manager and director of the government personnel."</seg>
<seg id="10">"he said about his appointment he said to Putin," "thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think that it is the most important task of the government to support your work as a state guide on the legislative powers and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday concluded that Ivanov asked to leave his post and called Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">How the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has taken Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest associate Vladimir Putin's and works like he for the Soviet secret service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"chief, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men stated that the staff chief resigned on his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smiles for the cameras, here are only few of them convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">This is what nobody knows.</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the official statement - that a man who was once approached by the potential president, who once would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - came across great scepticism."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his comments on Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said," It's true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation to tell me this very complicated item - you could almost say - Jewish post for four years. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential system for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and like Putin former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which was appointed KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people who trusted most."</seg>
<seg id="29">Once was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia as a third term of Putin's accession to the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another, near allies putins, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before coming back to President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="4">"it is the first of four extensions of the" cover plans "," which can end up to each of the three towers of the bridge. "</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes.</seg>

<seg id="12">"a total of nearly 79% of the total tan at their place and the last section of the decoder gets today in Rosyth a begggle for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted up on the bridge to its place."</seg>

<seg id="2">The SPD and Green mine: investors should in future be taken much stronger in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="4">"the SPD proposes a" "action concept" "to the next Ratsmeeting."</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">"first and foremost, it is about the question: who should actually build the cheap apartments?"</seg>
<seg id="7">A provision is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"SPD group leader Christoph Bratmann says:" "we agree with the Greens:" "who want to build on urban areas, will in future be able to exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also be in stock."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the great dispute point in the Town Hall was, however, as Bratmann:" how is you going to cope with investors who want to build on private surfaces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors on such a scale at least 10 percent, but as per as 20 percent of the apartments are building as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban residential building program, which will cost million costs and is still being financed, should provide incentives for incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, as Bratmann:" there is currently no agreement between the groups. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left still wants to maintain hardness for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"regardless of this, as Bratmann, a tightening of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the action concept, will be implemented for additional tasks in the construction administration."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the program is not entirely: for the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how is the loss of further around 1300 cheap apartments, whose funding will be running in the next few years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, it will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"to prevent this, the planatory policy spokesperson in Nicole Palm, should now be bought out of the city now."</seg>
<seg id="24">"furthermore, it would have to be thought of how apartments get back into the price-binding."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the West city.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in one fell swoop, the problem will resolve."</seg>
<seg id="27">"since in the West, the end of the year is running out."</seg>
<seg id="28">"some 1800 apartments, one could get back to the price of price for cheap apartments."</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: they do not want the owners, the housing companies."</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing in the west city increases drastically, one removes itself from the goal of the so-called mixture."</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "a concentration of social weak in just a few city districts will no longer be given."</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens count that there will be even movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Group president Holger Herlitchke says:" "for a wide majority, the CDU must take into the boat."</seg>

<seg id="8">"like many phenomena in the pop culture, the interest in the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand began in early July."</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by massive demand that overthrew the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days, Pokémon Go again had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>

<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it just looks the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns to health, people want to bring about 30 minutes to take" "from the sofa" "and" "every day to be active", "because many public messages are boring and coming from people who look miserable."</seg>

<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here."</seg>

<seg id="22">"thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people make hunting even new friendships.</seg>

<seg id="28">"even when Smartphone Apps like FitBit could already follow our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to practice sports as it does this game."</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveler Ian Wright completes his tongue for a travel guide to the dirty places of Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveler underwent his immune system and worgereflex of a serious examination - by putting some of the dirty and most important places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shrank his course on a Euro shooter, a railing on Piccadilly Circus, a flush knob of a migrating force, and a public telephone in Russia to proof the resilience of its immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before leaving every object, he used a luminometer to prove himself and to show us what he is going to get involved."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was recorded under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results in daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought, the insing knob of a tractor toilette blade, which has already been used by thousands of others, but actually are in a kitchen sink more bad bacteria."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright with doctors and medical professionals spoke about the promotion of bowel bacteria and his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left what he saw, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr. Wright has been known to test the resilience of his intestines, traveled by the world and ate peculiar things as well as wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public funds to train stations to flush up to sink, the task set up his immune system definitely under a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he told:" already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was justified to his reputation in any case.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the only thing he refused, was a dirty public toilet in Russia."</seg>
<seg id="14">Its probation line showed a luminous number of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the Luminometer number is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian restroom who refused to avert, after their louminous count was over 4000 units, while freshly harvested hands was one of less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel guides' The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial number at different places such as the bathroom "</seg>
<seg id="18">"he says," "This is coming to the worst what I have in a toilet, near."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing bad for it than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">"I will not try here, because it is ruddly here."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio. "</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company shaded Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which includes both dairy bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of bowel bacteria and the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Valios Senior Vice President for snacks, juices and New categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we really wanted to offer the consumer something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explain the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"we brought crazy brainstormings by, which ended with it that we said" Lass us Ian "." "</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking just about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily area, the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide the consumer more information in an interesting manner.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the director of the film, added:" let me tell me that - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had told some of the things I have relied on him, such as the ekelty Russian toilet that is shown in the movie. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to it and others where this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">"I am glad, that we have recorded some of these dirty goodies to film."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in one of Valio conducted survey conducted by 2015 by 84 percent of all surveyed dairy bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestine, and 58 percent said that they are at least occasionally products to use the spindle lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="9">"until 4 September 2016, the electoral and last Feria day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to go over by the people in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, when one can say that at all, has just begun."</seg>

<seg id="25">And with some points - in the unequal treatment of crush for example - the question arises: what does this have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">"but it does not allow himself to speak, that the attacks of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, many people face the high level of refugees to worry about security."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who actually buys sound boards?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle ages love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you head to the commentator, to sow him under the alias of non-aging men with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the promised regenesis of sound plates do not want to be on a boom in millennials that wish to welcome the realism of physical objects, but on Midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a record are all foresight after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes caused by hobbies - it has an emotional meaning: older records retain their feelings more likely (56% vs. 53%) and enjoying it alone time to spend (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you agree with the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on television, I would follow the camera while in the middle of a busy street in Soho drive, a modest grey starter, and wildest, before I steal, my hands hold and something determining how:" so, let us take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let us take a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart of sohos is slowly redeemed at its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sellers are located - still there are a handful of records."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman the camera to turn off for the next part, where I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops, trying to assess their age and minds through observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I came from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle ages) to the Reckless Records (data number: eight men middle ages, a woman, probably about the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already appreciate", "he says."</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these record plates, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I'm not followed at home), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: it is now able to buy plates that he could not afford, when they appeared, and again items that he sold, when he was young and plexed."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70's who appeared, when I was 11 or 12. things in which I was supposed to have something too young to buy them," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy plates, more introverted and gladly spend time, and add:" I don't smoke and I drink not much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers meet, which he meets on the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he has also noticed a new wave of people who have heard about the comeback, people who have heard about the comeback, and caused to be able to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"of the conversations that I have led, people usually get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, sell now their CDs to get their records back," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of a certain age of age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to recognize that record stores offers a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to the WEZ, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar sound-attens, of objects, the blissful jugenitals."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of solation," says WEZ. "</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as collectors and I think it is so many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's a simple way to get mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" flutes a staff of a record-pile.</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of the people who bought a record last month, they have not yet been heard."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey took place also that 41% have a record player, which they never use, while 7% of those who buy a plate, don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned while taking a stack at Bossa Nova Compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works in sounds of the Universe (data number: three men middle-age), has noticed a" trophy "of the Revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came only recently here and said," I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead record, so that I can put them into the shelf, "" he says. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a great percentage, but it is definitely happening."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more brittle, less musicians."</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people, who say," I have no record player. "</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older, who come slowly."</seg>
<seg id="44">"stopover, which has dedicated the record-plates almost a whole floor, has a colorful audience when I go."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourist, the photos do, teenager and women aged men."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-standing shops, Wild Beast New synthesizers and sexated pop instead of experimental jazz sailed from the loudspeakers - it's good to see such diversity among the customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them can be curious, but wet psychological traumas are hard to be detectable if one stands next to someone 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around for several minutes and considers the variation of the plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more likely to buy a shop-wafers as a major purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it does not deserve much, so collecting plates is not a real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it's easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of plates is..." it drives with a loved sigh. "</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"my last stop is a shop, which is said that a new generation of record-lovers have to be inspired: urban Outfitters."</seg>
<seg id="55">"as I give the semblance to mute the jeans Hoties, I watched a group of young teenager before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left you can find a staircase, a wall full of panels of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody looks at it - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to put them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"considering that any attraction for these objects might mean more money for the industry, and some customers could send in the depths of sohos for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"there is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, the one that is most for luxury objects such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even though my research inquiries made that the results of YouGov vote, they leave, at least in record business in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record-owner who exist in reality, record business and in Online."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the ummeln of the Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while they steer the rigid view of an uncanny, 30-year false moderator, who rises over the shoulders of the middle aged men."</seg>

<seg id="2">"French court has rejected a offer of authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7-er Rugby came in the finals on Thursday evening to a rupting stop at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at the icol stage here in Rio."</seg>

<seg id="8">"as he said, he was risky."</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operable and they did it.</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not do it, he spreads everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a quite bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changed a little bit of the view.</seg>

<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 meters, when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark have started up, Stanning and Glover had a lot in reserve."</seg>

<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not able to do anything Tolles.</seg>
<seg id="33">"we wanted no fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we also did."</seg>

<seg id="2">"military members of the United States Central Command changed political information to draw an optimistic image of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, than the actual states on the spot would have allowed the investigation committee of Congress in a report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the preliminary report, created by a Task Force of Republican members of armed forces, intelligence agencies and the Wehrbudgetary, reported by large dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence agencies who reported how provisionaries changed their assessments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"newsletters, which has been characterized by high-level CentCom commanders, represented regularly a more positive image of American efforts against terrorism than the actual states on site and have been more positive as analyses of other news services," cited a newspaper article. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what is done at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering when poor analyses of our political leaders are presented," presented Ken Calvert, Republicanic member of the House of Representatives. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership errors in CentCom are far enough until the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed ongoing problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts at the education of the Iraqi armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct references to that government tips given under Obama instructions, it shows how analysts saw the pressure from their preliminary laws, an optimal picture of the threat of the Islamic state, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements above the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts presented."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a CentCom provider announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls can already be started in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, it is so clear." "said Mike Pompeo, Republican congress members from Kansas, in an opinion."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the tops of Central Command changed the aftermath reports to play the risk of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">Republicans called the Task Force in Life after they played that analysts are worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings during the investigations.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigations of CentCom reports are underway by the General Secretary of Defense Department."</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Newsletter on Thursday released their own findings that coincides with some of the conclusions of Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years 2014 and 2015 the CentCom created an overly restricted process for the preparation of subsequent intermittances at ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the highest degree of democrat Adam B. ship, in an opinion of opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, so Mr. Schiff," delayed the publication of paper-related reports, "reparations the moral under analysts and" gave a little space for deviating opinions. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said, no references to an intervention of the White House at the CentCom analyst on a" certain political opinion "have found."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported by investigations by the General Assembly of the Pentagon, which were recorded according to complaints from CentCom analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a spokesman of the Pentagon, gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defense would not have any reports of Congress, while the investigation of the General Staff was still under way."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also said that" "experts at times have quite diverging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the Defense Department gave a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">"the investigations on the question of a successful aviation campaign led by an American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion, which is made by a growing number of members of the Defense Department)."</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the accusations of last year have raised the question to what extent President Obama can rely on the Central Command of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism regarding the secret information of the Islamic State remind of constraints of more than ten years ago, as a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, a writer on how many analysts met with the recommendations of many analysts just a small occupation of occupation in Iraq, and a little time on it turned to thought about the consequences of the invasion of 2003."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker to mention government agencies that would not have any significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these temporary refineries were put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market."</seg>

<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which the two will gain in their group from six teams at first and second place."</seg>
<seg id="9">The first place placed the strong wood-country a little longer off the way that the other group will lead.</seg>
<seg id="10">"as always the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex through their success story, four years after she landed at the last London Games in the last few of 12 places."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a Hockeyracket in hands (her two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became the National Bank of the USA, the most recent in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">"she missed the Olympiad in 2008, as she could not qualify for the kayak."</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the year 2012 came in which she and her team went all wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham was born, an Englishman, trainer of the National Team and thus began to turn things to better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have to work in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have all able to snatch the rod completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday morning Bam opened the Torrims in the first half of the game with a setback from the close range.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India was going to play in the game without victory in the tournament, but the team showed himself surprisingly tough and held the board of 1-0 to the third quarter, until Bam took their hands in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it brought a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the center and took the ball into the gate to get the American female a 2-0 leadership."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last district.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first round of the tournament for the goalkeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Exactly like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position" said Parnham, but how well will depend on Saturday the outcome of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time in the Olympic Games and a women's warm with dimples, could have been quite among these known names could have been sent to Prime Time, build through sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if he would be a swimmer, turner or even feeder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in the olympic trampoline for gold."</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame does not illuminated any event straight away.</seg>

<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada this year will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline has a certain outsider tip, partly because it sounds more suitable for a clowness school than that sounds for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a single enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the cartoonable tremor of his never to end clouds - but also the Grazie of the turnaround and numbing, the two sports that it essentially unites."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" "trampoline" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as" springboard. ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators are calling for political changes in Ethiopia and are based on violent resistance by the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that sixty protesters were killed during clashes with police officers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia straight forward to break up?</seg>
<seg id="6">"over the last ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in recent months, protests against the government turned the country and extended into more and more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people rushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's answer to human rights organisations was inmerciful.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses told that policemen were shot in an unarmed protesters.</seg>
<seg id="11">"creeping videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how safety people were hit with sticks while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Security Agency for Human Rights now demands a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it becomes even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopian region to fight terror over the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if at all, get as much western aid."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new pendulum in the capital of Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the roads are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have consistently pursued the oppression of the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, whereby dissident was effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many have been sent into exile, or sent into prison, killed or driven into the deserts of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and these no other options have to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopian. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth are protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">"there are numerous ailments, which covers everything from the ground-use until the sausage in relation to power of the ruling coalition."</seg>
<seg id="26">"following a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies led the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, the tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a battle for this contentaned, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst fear that separatists were just like the Oromo-liberation front or the National Liberation Front of Ogaden in recent years more or less imposed on the turbulence and could be arming themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of falling apart from the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first appears harmless: smart phones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, a lot of Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media as bilberry Smartphones became more and more common and the Internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government bonds access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, mainly in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies which conceal where they are staying."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians insisted that they were gathered together so protesters.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there are more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons prosperied the Amharas, which come from Aegean, predominantly Christian highlands, during the politics and the economy, while they exploited the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this changes straight.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which constitute about 6 percent of the population and that are dominant in the military, in the secret services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former Rebels leader, was until his death on a non-publicized disease in 2012, 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that it was particularly disguised to perceive early signs of discontent and to use special requests to edit opponents and make them unhealthy.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian new Prime Minister, Hailemariachi Desalegn, was chosen for relatively uncareful reasons to take the position of Mr Meles. "</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr Meles, who came out of the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopian, Mr Haitian mariachi come from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say that he does not enjoy the trust of the Tigray controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia was experienced such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands of elections were protested, which apparently was stolen by the government, according to Analytical Government and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following raids, many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in the last months and those days of unrest went over quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new pendulum, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">"but obviously, this has not prevented the intention of internal disappearances of the Ethiopian government."</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protesting in Gondar, an official city, of Tigray-run shops and the hatred towards the Tigray will ever more exercise in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst say that the protests against the US and other Western allies are in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronym flights over the neighboring Somalia, even if it was recently signed that it has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West wants to fully support democracy, he does not want his allies collapses in a already volatile area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "said Mr. Abdi," "is a very thin atrocity."</seg>

<seg id="14">"at the end of July he continued strong criticism as he said, the Russians ought to crack Mrs. Clint's emails, but later he said," Of course I meant the sarcastic. "</seg>

<seg id="3">Grönlandhaie usually comes only during winter to finish surfaces.</seg>

<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandhaie received only 150 years of offspring.</seg>

<seg id="8">"only when it arrives, speeds up the five meters long animals on satte 2,6 km / h - and with this maximum speed is half as fast as a seal."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this from cross-sufficiency, but seems to be a patent for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" Science "at any rate by a Greenland, which could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," said Alexander Schweissen from Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life-span, which means for vertebrates a world record. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"admittedly, the evolutionary biologist already suspected that Greenland-haie stony become old."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacking the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland-haie are difficult to observe, eventually they live mainly in the polar sea before the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water-temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually dive in the surface only in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">About the lifestyle of Greenland-haie researchers know accordingly little.</seg>
<seg id="17">"her time-pentagon Maes she, when she called six animals with a transmitter, six animals before Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="18">"loot, nevertheless, make this sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal, researchers thought the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">"possibly they hunt sleepy animals or patrol at the bottom of the Iron, and search carcasses, which from higher water layers downward."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitsbergen as a applause from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimetres measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed with the carbon-14 method the linsenators of the sharks."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye-linse is already created before the birth of the sharks, which contained therein is no longer renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the linsenators.</seg>
<seg id="25">"after the early 1960s, their birth should lie in the atmosphere after the early 1960s."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in that, with 220 centimeters of length of the smallest animal, the linsenators contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenlandhaie had a normal carbon-14 amounts in their lenses. it is created by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14-watch showed for a 493 centimetres long Greenland, an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimetres can be even 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenlandhai females only get worse when they are longer than four meters, was well-known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers could assign a age to the length of the length."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters were probably at the threshold for sexually mature, and his age with 156 years was determined, Grönlandhaie was obviously at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">"also, this is likely to be a world record for vertebrates."</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusales live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"also the previous record-holder, a 211 year old Greenlandwal, in whose speck at the neck a 120 years old harpoon pointed, was captured before Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there live on savings."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and sometimes more slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to warm water in the cold water, the animals are also often particularly big."</seg>
<seg id="38">"because the volume is much faster than its surface, by which the animal gets heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram is therefore much greater than in one gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous, and should concentrate on having as many descendants as soon as possible," explains the evolution of evolution. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was most likely to be inhabitable."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterproof surface and CO2-dense atmosphere was once noted."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the long-turn of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, a similar atmosphere and still slow down."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably proved to be more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and be protected from faster evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus profited also from a sun that was 30 percent less.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS modeling simulating the slow turn of Venus its day-side of the sun almost two months long," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio stated in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this heated the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer clouds, which affects the surface of a large proportion of the sun warms."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average-temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the model brought forth a story of Venus, which was similar to evolution that has previously been suspected of planetary research."</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was once believed to be inhabitable, Venus -- in the course of several billion years, was exposed to a lot of heat and ultraviolet light."</seg>
<seg id="15">Her oceans evaporated and her water vapour was burned down by the ultraviolet light.</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmer from compressor malware currently rely on targeted companies - and they are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a current survey of the malware of malware experts Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany were 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months at least once, partly several victims of an attack with blacksmith software."</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany almost 20 percent of firms were already aiming at a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of victims paid by the perpetrators demanded by the perpetrators to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their extorser software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to attack in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potentially explosive ransom is considerably higher than with private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of damage," explains Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the Malware programs were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the offenders discovered software for himself.</seg>
<seg id="11">"only private users were the target, but the change to company attacken took place startling quickly in the past months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware is working after a simple pattern: once on the computer a victim, it looks specifically for unlong changed files such as Word-, Excel- or database files, as well as archives of pictures and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the ransomware and deletes the originals lasting.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the software presents the demands of the blacksmith.</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the final turnkey code to the files, the victims need money - mostly in the form of cryptographic Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where private users use the personal Photo database on the game, it is important for companies with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production stops."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage is due when a ransomware strikes."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the affected German firms by ransomware, 13 per cent even had to break down the business, in a case, people were aware of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals were victims of attacks, whose patients may be threatened by the loss of medical actors."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say the victims always: pays not, you therefore only promote the problem," says Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data back."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of perpetrators, given by stalemate in the operation."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know that and try to build up a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure the utility finishes and contact with blackmailers examined and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their sacrifices by chat, how they can pay per Bitcoin, set free accessible support sites or decode for example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if private people solves to payments of few hundreds of euros, companies need to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums up to retrieve their data."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the ransomware blackmail, the hacker will always be professional and share the work, explains safety experts Chester Wisniewski from Antivirus-provider Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware around within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"more likely, it is likely that it is three or four people."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their contaminants then in the form of a software building to the actual blacksmith.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the previous malware kits were created by the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars were purchased."</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is a adaptive tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening, one fell eternally awake, at night the time is up for hours, in the morning there is much more to think about sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, you have such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch-Institut, about a quarter of adults are sleeping disorders and more than ten percent experience their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How are sleeping problems or sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleeping disorders, and there can be diverse causes underlying them, says Hans-Günter Wear, Board member of the German Society for sleeping research and sleeping medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what you understand by them is, but the Insomnie is, so an input and a slederous disorder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"just sleep many people feel as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, Board member of the German house association with practice in the German-Saxon Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleeping disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"they can also be organic, mental or obsessive-conditional factors, but also drugs."</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the intoxication expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early waking up is mostly in depression common," says Wear. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that various factors are thanised one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">"who for instance has a slipped disk, can be bad, watch every two to three hours and begins to greet, about everyday problems and worries, Wear is an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should one go to the doctor with sleeping disorders to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">"who is not well asleep for a period of one month at least three nights per week and the day is impaired, should go to the doctor, betraying Wear."</seg>
<seg id="19">"impairment can be quite different: it is tired, tired, unexhausted, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has moods or bodily ailments such as stomach or headaches."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate the intoxication, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"as a treatment options, among other things, behaviour change, a cognitive behavioural therapy or even medicines - classical sleeping tables only in exceptional cases and no more than two weeks."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in Germany there are hardly anything in Germany, Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary medical center at the Charité University Medical Center Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore, one should immediately turn to the physician first at bedtime, reveals Wear."</seg>
<seg id="24">It can clarify with investigations as to whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who was to go to sleep laboratory, and what happens there?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for examination in the dormitories of medical doctors, for example in snoring with respiratory placements, with illness-effective day-fatigue, at bedtime, or if you find the cause of a slederous disorder, nothing is explained."</seg>
<seg id="27">One does not have to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a lunch," says Fighter. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"after gluing, one gets to the bed of his normal time."</seg>

<seg id="7">"in particular, the Berlin senator Henkel had been advocated several times since the beginning of the year for a hard action of the police against the project, the region referred to as" no-go zone "for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, patched the police three weeks long, patched parts of the road and held visitors away from entering the house with the number 94."</seg>

<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">"left violence is not the main plaza of many inhabitants: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the Kiev since 1999, and Jana *, who runs here three children, mainly by the police presence of genervt."</seg>

<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class, which also has a lower average level in comparison to the rest of the city and has high poverty risk."</seg>
<seg id="18">"also householders and the native native projects belong already long to the Pinez: 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost all the entire Mainzer street near the Rigaer."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer was vacated under great police officers in a downright street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the district in recent years has become increasingly becoming the magnets for tourists and constituents from all over the world: with them now they share their inhabitants from the GDR and former household occupied their pines."</seg>
<seg id="21">This also has been noticeable in the rents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newly built structures in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes it in congested discs or freshly harvested facades that were ejected with color.</seg>
<seg id="23">"no other street was mentioned this year along with the words" "left-autonomous violence". ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"one reason that not all neighbours could see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as bodily injury, statistics are estimated almost exclusively against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the crimes are made of damage which tendon't make the newly built and newly renovated homes.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who lived in a flat house next to the controversial 94 years, there will be no talk of insecurity."</seg>
<seg id="27">"concerning violence, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, they don't have been."</seg>

<seg id="29">"for the studied architect, her street is not a criminal point, on the contrary:" "here you can help each other, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>

<seg id="31">"therefore, it was also so important that the inhabitants get back their street: from the police, politics and the media, all of which suddenly claimed the interpretation of the city in July."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of women like Neugebauer, the street will continue to be taken away: by stepless new constructions in former buildings, which suppress the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are ultimately the property apartments, which are not interesting for many here - here are more people living not so well located", "she says."</seg>
<seg id="34">"violence and destruction can I absolutely no harm." ""</seg>

<seg id="9">"was searched for an administrative work with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just an affled wool sau."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, administrative work is not their central area, Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organization, work with the local people and also behind the scenes as well as networking activity."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been involved in the course of around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent spot on three years of time.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine Customer, that Annika Deuschle honors and full-time actors are supported. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are large and small issues, organizational, human and insurgations."</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are available in the washing road</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem is it for some time to find apartments for the Connections which have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The communes are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">You need to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the cost of construction, rent or renovations of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Council office to the Commune and job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designed for some time as very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far it is not working, you should rely on private apartments, so Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, common apartments must be viewed as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are placed in the washing road.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine Customer and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a firm lead, it is traineeship, training places, educational sites, a-euro-jobs and offences for refugees and migrants that have to be put or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help domestic, do non-profit work - and this motivates and very neat, such as Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community to play a positive impact.</seg>
<seg id="34">"that is" "no employment therapy." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day need a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a lack of taste.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so, we need offers such as sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So you can also jump in managing and volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"you need to explain the refugees that it takes time and can make it reasonable for the time, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who will develop the feeling at some point, he could not help in Urbach anyone who do not work and be useless, he will never integrate."</seg>
<seg id="45">The marked majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"there is also, however, the customer is honest," people, where nothing works. "the work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: did the two pretend fear of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine customer very clearly, "" what some sort of it might be naive. "" a restrisiko could and if it doesn't want to exclude them. "</seg>
<seg id="50">"sensitizes, the helper is already."</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents also be subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">That would have the fear of bringing the attacks completely into obliging.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"so, main and volunteers must keep on site and in the region according to activities."</seg>
<seg id="56">"in doing so, they always have in the background that soon a new push of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach."</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">The question is clear to answer this question.</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to place it on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"we have not arrived in Urbach where we would like to go," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees would let the situation relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also clearly makes the fact that the Urbacher shall also be fully utilised to integrate the hitherto people.</seg>
<seg id="63">"this is currently around 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political situation is so complicated, there is no easy answers."</seg>
