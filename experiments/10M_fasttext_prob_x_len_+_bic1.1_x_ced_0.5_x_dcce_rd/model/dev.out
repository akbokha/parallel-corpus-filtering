Obama gre@@ ts Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as backing Tehran &apos;s destabili@@ zing action in the Middle East .
&quot; but in meeting the conflict with the Palestinians , there is also a two @-@ state solution to the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years .
Washington has critic@@ ised the ongoing res@@ ett@@ lement of Israel and squee@@ zing a lack of peace during the peace process .
&quot; because of the kind of Obama promoted , the deal of the Iranian nuclear programme has further deterior@@ ated the relationship of the two . &quot;
&quot; in March , Netanyahu had held a controversial address at the invitation of the Republi@@ can Congress , which was partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , but a meeting had refused access to the upcoming election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency , Professor , his friend being shot . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency , Professor Sh@@ annon told me a somewhat timi@@ d voice of the police , that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
he was stres@@ sing to emphas@@ ise that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; still live and probably excited and he said the family contact of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
&quot; within the house , the officers arrived the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was cool@@ ed to a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I could und@@ o it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; he was no indication that he was represented in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ veland , Mississippi , lying already 300 miles from the school territory , where he wrote a popular history professor , eth@@ ane Schmidt , at the door to his office and killed . &quot;
Delta State University Chi@@ proo@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that universal staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that he has made a fatal emergency one before it .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was a further death : lamb was killed by the police , when the police took him . &quot;
&quot; a day after the shooting at the University , the students and faculty to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what is motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff , who knew him , helped in doing a picture of a talented , but perhaps difficult teacher to draw . &quot;
students said that they were happy to attend his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where he desc@@ endant died , said he did not have any history of violence or a criminal pre@@ acher . &quot;
&quot; he himself was mentioned in a book written by him in whom he mentioned the &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both instruc@@ ted in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty members encompasses 17 members , and many students attended courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some in@@ clin@@ ations to problematic .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , he &apos;s praised , he also seemed a little excited and nervous , as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mi@@ ley Sy@@ kes , said that I told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
he had asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said he had any health problem some health reasons .
in this year he set only two online courses .
recent changes in the Employment policies of the university mean that the promotion has worked so hard for the Lamb for him to represent him no guarantee of an automatic route to an application as assistant .
&quot; earning president William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know about a conflict between Paul &apos;s and Schmidt , but , of course , there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are questions that cannot be answered .
&quot; after the escape from the campus , the police finally found Lam@@ bs flan@@ k when he returns to Mississippi Dr@@ as imports . &quot;
&quot; he could have been arrested , killed himself in a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ols in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ tes meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still going on in the way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lamb got to this house , but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
he grew up in the area .
&quot; he began his work at the university in 2009 , who has 3,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants , and under@@ rated Ge@@ ography and Ped@@ ago@@ gy . &quot;
he graduated in spring in education .
&quot; one of the many years of friends Lam@@ bs proclaimed him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Carla H@@ air@@ ston said , she was 15 and lamb was 20 , when they met through mutual friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar game . &quot;
he was then the woman &apos;s flock .
&quot; all the girls indul@@ ged when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson District of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ sts were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency , he said , &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; &quot; but there was no evidence of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house that was adjacent to a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said they were divor@@ ced from 15 years ago , but friends were left and had a daughter who was 19 years old now . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he &apos;s never struck , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
Lamb he desc@@ ends when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail stood up three years ago both in a summer @-@ year market .
later they played together one or the other g@@ ig .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse that worked for different companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak k@@ lighted bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he graduated in Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night during the night 5 September , after he graduated with his guitar and mouth @-@ chi@@ cks before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the reception and sh@@ one with each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of jo@@ kes .
&quot; Schmidt , the messenger professor , led the young semester program and specialized on American ab@@ orig@@ ines and colonial history , said Don All@@ an Mitch@@ ell , a English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
&quot; he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as , and was president of his Brotherhood and of the students committee . &quot;
&quot; at the Delta State campus in Cle@@ veland , the Tuesday evening about 900 people , including lec@@ tur@@ ers , employees , students and members of the commune in a candl@@ eli@@ ght service ceremony . &quot;
&quot; Schmid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt was also part of the memorial , during which univers@@ ality sang &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; amazing grace &quot; sang . &quot;
the education will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ gel@@ io Soli@@ s told from Cle@@ veland , Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi ; and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans having contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story was corrected , in order to seal the police now saying that he made the emergency call , after he was killed Schmidt and that Lamb in his emergency call was freed though his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;

Michael J. Fox Light@@ ning over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat is next to me , and it will gradually realise that Princess Diana will sit in front of me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;

UN Secretary says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; ban K@@ i @-@ Moon , Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ Moon , explains its response to Russian boo@@ sted military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years of lasting conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen the violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN Chief is calling for all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; the press conference said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - to discuss the situation in Syria at the ver@@ ge of the General Assembly . &quot;
he de@@ pl@@ ores that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable .
&quot; B@@ an urged five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , that proved to be proved by Iran in reaching a nuclear strike . &quot;
&quot; 8 Re@@ quired values , which show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious to take . &quot;
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some re@@ public@@ ans attempt to draw Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in surveys from below , it didn &apos;t work ( yet ) . &quot;
ten of the last eleven national surveys Donald Tr@@ ump showed in a double @-@ digit range and some begin to ask oneself what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate .
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claimed that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphas@@ ise that Rick &apos;s leadership was given by Rick &apos;s leadership on rising Herman Cain , none of whom had won only one state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have fought in a general election .
&quot; but external parties of the parties like Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super PAC and the conservative daily group Club for Growth now acknowledge tr@@ umps in stamina , and begin to let their dollars flow to fall . &quot;
here are some current survey values which indicate that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a tran@@ sit@@ ing phase :
• The popularity levels have turned around 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump ob@@ announced his can@@ did@@ acy to mid June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth University appeared that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positively . &quot;
by mid July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
&quot; now , six out of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
some three out of ten tell that they have a negative opinion .
these figures keep in early states .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac con@@ vote in Iowa has determined last week that 60 percent of Re@@ public@@ ans have a good opinion from Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the G@@ OP @-@ elec@@ tors G@@ OP would be happy with p@@ umping as candidates .
&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / Or@@ c last week we said 67 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans , they would be either &quot; thrilled &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two out of ten say they would be &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; when he was the candidate . &quot;
&quot; Ben Car@@ son just got the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 per cent ) , they would be &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tr@@ ump . &quot;
the next in the field of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they are &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry , &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the Favor@@ ite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of re@@ public@@ ans does not regard ul@@ ating temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ bas@@ tic and insul@@ ting statements , consider 52 per cent of the re@@ public@@ ans of Irish voters , that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l have the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is present in the nation state of the nation , the State of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of Re@@ public@@ ans believe that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; although 44 percent think that he won &apos;t have the personality to effectively perform his ministry , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament does not p@@ asse to the White House , so ABC / post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters have got used to the idea .
&quot; if they set off their nest @-@ belts , det@@ ects Republi@@ can voters Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; when they are asked , who wins the most likely the G@@ OP @-@ nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CN@@ N / Or@@ c from the past week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s a change since time , when four out of ten ended their money on Je@@ b Bush . &quot;
full disclosure : g@@ OP @-@ voters had not the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this stage in the last cycle four of ten Re@@ public@@ ans had given that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination opposite only 28 % for the final Candi@@ date Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
&quot; nevertheless , it shows that a large number of G@@ OP @-@ elec@@ tors will be able to look at a plau@@ sible topic . &quot;
&quot; even if the re@@ public@@ ans are gathered around a different Candi@@ date , Tr@@ ump hits almost everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts suggest that the sh@@ atter@@ ing field is likely to contribute to a similar course , during the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ Support to more than a dozen other candidates diff@@ use . &quot;
&quot; but a survey on Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ head @-@ head @-@ head between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump will appoint your health support . &quot;
&quot; he has more points ahead of C@@ arly Fior@@ ina 13 points , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally in front of edge Paul , John Ka@@ acqu@@ ard and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ on @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strike it ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a scarce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ Fan says that they have formed their opinion .
&quot; a new survey of CB@@ S / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump , say they have for@@ given their voices . &quot;
&quot; of course , much may happen to change that , and no one can really say , never change the mind . &quot;
&quot; 46 percent said that they leave the door open , to switch to other candidates . &quot;
&quot; still , Tr@@ umps is the most important competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion , are twice as common for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
6 of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say they are in agreement with Tr@@ ash on the issue of immigration .
&quot; since then Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaigns were called from Mexico &quot; Rap@@ ist , &quot; the immigration and ful@@ crum point was in public discourse on 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ bas@@ tic expression of Tr@@ ump pi@@ geons will maintain the Hisp@@ ano American from the Republi@@ can party and damage the future @-@ oriented efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / post survey of Monday , six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans have decided that they are in agreement with a cl@@ ump in issues of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as the immigration in the spotlight is left , Donald Tr@@ ump will also continue to do . &quot;
the frustration on the government clim@@ bs on new heights .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , meanwhile , falls around half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , particularly through their out@@ sider status . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry with Washington .
&quot; a survey of D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa before two weeks shows that three of four Iowa Re@@ public@@ ans have been frustr@@ ated over the Republi@@ can in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; polite . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive of Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the Nord@@ se@@ e@@ watt .
in the street it costs a square meter of a living @-@ house at an average 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects naturally is limited , i.e. , in the study - that is , therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows how particular clim@@ bs a square meter at most .
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for one student dor@@ de in Munich are not really a little . &quot;
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top @-@ good clubs this price is mainly like a pe@@ an@@ uts .
&quot; the real estate service providers angel &amp; folk , has issued a list of the most exclusive German public locations - with square footage into di@@ zz@@ ying high places . &quot;
&quot; there are several tens of a thousand Euros nothing - per square meter , well @-@ noted . &quot;

&quot; Müller received in his 28 hit in the Champions League for the Bav@@ arian expedition , the Ad@@ oration of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who sent one as a stro@@ lling to the Master &apos;s opinion . &quot;

they showed a concentrated and committed idea without res@@ trained .
&quot; Piraeus had won his most recent six home games in the Königs@@ Class , including famous clubs as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
2011 he stum@@ bled here also Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; Bavaria , in seven European @-@ up @-@ du@@ els with Greek teams un@@ defeated , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
they were brave @-@ ran to work with their open efforts but often into action @-@ less .
the attacks were introduced too often via playing shift on Link@@ sau@@ ces Douglas Costa , who has rarely passed against the old SPD &apos;s Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
Müller had more luck on the right side than its flan@@ k from the right half @-@ field in the left upper part of the gate .
in the 6@@ 7th century the world championship gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Le@@ ut@@ owski .
&quot; initially , the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storms ide@@ ye Brown hit the head of the Poland on the line ( 26 ) . &quot;

&quot; at the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was decided against him when he came to King@@ sle@@ y Com@@ at , for the lead bath ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot;

&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth &quot;
&quot; who smo@@ kes , sh@@ lands not only of the lung , but also the teeth - that lies a central Pots@@ dam@@ er study . &quot;
good news : in ren@@ unciation cases the risk decrease quickly .
smokers have a much higher risk to lose their teeth early .
&quot; this produces from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the German Institute of Nutrition Research ( DI@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smokers , there was the risk of losing their teeth prematurely in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3,@@ 6 times higher . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23 300 atten@@ dees .
major contribut@@ ors for tooth failure are c@@ aries and inflammation of the g@@ um line , stresses the DI@@ E E . &quot;
&quot; for these par@@ o@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , stress the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and dental loss therefore goes back to frequent g@@ um inflammation in smokers .
it is not clear whether smoking is also increasing the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; people who were hearing from smoking could reduce their risks but within a short time , the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but it could take over ten years until the threat again to the level of non @-@ smokers , &quot; said Mr. Thomas Diet@@ rich from the English University Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one must convince humans of being forced to become non @-@ smoking , &quot; &quot; the study of the Boeing of the DI@@ E &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; not smoking is good for lungs and vessels , and according to our knowledge also results in good dental health up to the high age . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , more than 20 percent of the population at the age of 65 is affected by sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , divided by DI@@ F@@ E . &quot;
earlier investigations have already pointed out that smoking is risk of early tooth failure .
the new long @-@ term study corro@@ bor@@ ns the findings .
archae@@ ologists launch an Köl@@ ner Rhein@@ u@@ fer on Res@@ et@@ ees from the late period
for the repeti@@ tive time on the right Rhein@@ u@@ fer in Cologne archaeological Disco@@ veries occurred .
&quot; in the vicinity of the building site for the new Rhein@@ boulevard have archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ museum skel@@ et@@ ons and lef@@ to@@ os historical buildings excav@@ ated , &quot; said Museum manager Marcus Tri@@ er on Tuesday . &quot;

&quot; apart from the for@@ ging of the fortress and the Kir@@ cht@@ ur@@ ms , a cemetery with around 350 graves were discovered , which probably belonged to the church . &quot;

EU @-@ Commission propos@@ ing a new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; to increase the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement , the EU Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbitration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private arbitration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be solved by a transpar@@ ant system , which in its way considerably more traditional dishes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that trusted the citizens , &quot; stated the EU Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ ström in their presentation . &quot;
the Swedish din suggested the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade agreement with the US .
the German Government announced support .
&quot; through TTIP , it aims to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people . &quot;
the plans for re@@ forming the current arbitration proceedings make it concrete that the EU and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment agency .
they should come to equal parts from the EU and the United States and from third countries .
it is for the first time a second instance .
it would allow it to raise against jud@@ gements .
&quot; up to now , the procedures involved themselves with each other as arbitr@@ ator , an objection to their opinions was not given . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of the past months , it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fairness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long run , she wants to stop working on a International Investment Tribunal for a long @-@ term basis . &quot;
the dispute between Chinese companies and the EU states could also be cleared there .
the investor @-@ state arbitration proceeding particularly required mainly by large @-@ state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ state arbitration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) is considered one of the main reasons for the big resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; the traditional arbitration previously will be critic@@ ised by oppos@@ ers as a kind of parallel de@@ bit@@ ing the tax@@ payers , the tax@@ payers , national laws or a reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act , proposals by the European Commission , were insufficient . &quot;
it is particularly critic@@ ised that they are not considered for the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German economic @-@ state Secretary Matthias W@@ nig ( SPD ) describes the plans on the other hand as a big progress .
&quot; the Commission considered essential points with the reform , which Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel were developed in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot;
the old system of private arbitration courts was of the table .
even the French government welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European corporation of Busin@@ ess@@ Europe warned against that the pi@@ anos in the economy are limiting by too many new rules .
&quot; particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be disadvantaged , meant . &quot;
when the talks on TTIP negotiations ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) talks continued on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been underway since mid 2013 .
&quot; however , the subject of investor protection has not been discussed with the US so far . &quot;
initially a framework for the agreement should be reached at the end of this year .
this date is regarded as no longer ten@@ able .
saus@@ age Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
thirteen years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is sitting on the stage at the Köl@@ ner Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
&quot; next to him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart , which the timi@@ d fo@@ ks@@ gi@@ ers made the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with fil@@ z@@ ni@@ ft . &quot;
&quot; the whole audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; he tells by various places that he always cat@@ ered on the map , what he writes about his or delicate songs . &quot;
where they came up and how it looks there in his home country .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens proves itself as a wonderful creative mis@@ cre@@ ement .

&quot; it arises the rum@@ or , &quot; &quot; Michigan &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a forced series : each of the 50 US states ought to be ter@@ med . &quot;

&quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens already uses the &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic work@@ pieces . &quot;
&quot; this sixth studio album is still widely orchestr@@ ated , but supported by programmed sequences or Be@@ ats and plays with all sorts of effect and hall . &quot;
&quot; long ago , the smaller clubs still rose , the stage shows are turned into the colorful spectacle from ne@@ on forehead , and big fluor@@ es@@ cing stage de@@ co . &quot;

&quot; without keeping a word to the public , the group of top musicians plays out through the wide @-@ enriched album . &quot;

Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ ne &apos;s debut in the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ne &apos;s debut is expected with the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister with tension . &quot;
the new Labour leader Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ n will be his debut in the prime minister of the Prime Minister and with David Cameron in the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be invited to ask the Mr Cor@@ by@@ n to set the first of his six pre @-@ given questions shortly after lunch and his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MEPs .
he requested &quot; less theater and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some meetings to leave it to colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ no guidance , because after his appointment as a member of the S &amp; D Group and its speech at the TU@@ C meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leaders , on Tuesday during the singing of the National An@@ them with a commemor@@ ative ceremony on the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has prov@@ oked criticism by a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and stands at the focal point of several top @-@ pages stories in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ no decision , not having the national an@@ them to sing , has drawn attention to himself &quot;
a spokes@@ man for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he &quot; had gotten &quot; in dis@@ respectful silence &quot; and he accepted the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns sha@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he got to the Labour Party , &quot; &quot; independent &quot; &quot; of his faith that the monarchy should be abolished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns top team , and they were called in differences with the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than one @-@ sixth of the Party of Par@@ liam@@ entary Party was originally supported as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ acking within the Labour Party , following Mr Cor@@ by@@ no A@@ pronoun@@ cements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of winn@@ ings . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference to put forward British changes in order to remove the whole idea of a limit altogether .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions minister said that the party &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; was that it was only down against the government plans to reduce the limitation of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth British leader who has been David Cameron since then he is T@@ ory CEO - in the last decade over the Disp@@ atch Group in the Parliament .
&quot; the Labour leader , who promised a different policy approach , says he won &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions on Mr Cameron and had given him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ lington North MP said that the fra@@ ying of the Prime Minister has said to confront and that he is refra@@ ining from serious problems and struggling with resistance , and instead it has made to concentrate on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , who is represented by the shadows of the Minister of Israel , if he is not participating - for example , if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea to conversation , that other colleagues occasionally show the word , and that he John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the sub@@ house , approached to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; as he was finished in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he would be rep@@ lied with his &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ Theatre &quot; , &quot; who is often linked to the leader of the Prime Minister . but some years later he de@@ mented me that he has failed . &quot;
&quot; as it was first sent on television in 1990 , the question was seen with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the ruling of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position under his parliament@@ ar@@ ism , although critics have ar@@ gues that it has become a caricature and than@@ ked sufficient reforms . &quot;

&quot; the pound has risen according to data that raised a rise in wage growth of the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE was increased by the B@@ ot@@ s@@ goal SA@@ BM@@ iller today . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , the result without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.6 % compared to the same period of the previous year . &quot;
this percentage was the fastest since 2009 and made assessments of an interest rate at the time of interest .
&quot; the pound has increased by more than 1 % compared to the dollar on $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was lo@@ oped up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro on 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 Index lock with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump out of 20 % after the acquisition of the ri@@ vals AB In@@ Be@@ v had been received .
&quot; one transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies of the world and combine the brands such as Bud@@ ě@@ jo@@ z , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were an up@@ looking news from the competition group for luxury goods Ri@@ o@@ ont 0,@@ 9 % higher .
&quot; Ri@@ o@@ on &apos;s newest sales numbers hit all expectations , and also showed that sales in China - a key market for bur@@ berry - will again be growth again . &quot;
&quot; shares of Glen@@ core increased by 5 % , after the mountain construc@@ tor said that he took 2,5 billion $ by a stock market as part of his strategy of debt reduction . &quot;

the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages may jeop@@ ardi@@ ze the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean more buying power in the pockets of potential customers .
&quot; but it is unlikely that this buying power will be the higher co@@ workers at his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could boost the expansion @-@ plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean there is less additional jobs . &quot;

Met@@ ropolis is launching an insur@@ rec@@ tionary campaign to combat Al@@ di@@ - obj@@ ections
met@@ es tries to protect the Ig@@ A @-@ branches in front of an Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ ali@@ zers have launched a bottom @-@ speed campaign to defend the market share of Ig@@ A @-@ retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million US invasion .
&quot; during Al@@ di the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia prepared early next year , strengthen metals and Ig@@ A @-@ supermarkets their relationships with local food suppliers and build the Ig@@ A through mainstream marketing and marketing via the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A @-@ merchants and suppliers are ski@@ pped on board , with brands like ic@@ ers S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , which are distributed in Ig@@ A @-@ stores and shop @-@ owners , who sell bil@@ low tickets for the South Australian soccer league to faithful customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ rac has published further details of his defense strategy on 29 September when wholesale distributor for food , alcohol and devices will be carrying out their annual investor strategy . &quot;
&quot; there is much at stake as South Australia and Western Australia account almost 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ Lad@@ en@@ business , and generating higher profit margins as met@@ a @-@ network in the East @-@ states . &quot;
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ated provincial and Ig@@ A retailer have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 per cent in Western Australia compared to some 14 per cent in the eastern states . &quot;
&quot; analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Al@@ di twelve months after opening his first markets around five percent of the food market will cut off in these two states and take all existing players , but mainly independent retailers sales . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley shows that Ig@@ A @-@ retailer 360 million are generated per year and met@@ cash 250 million euros by the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branch in SA and 30 in the next year , and generates sales of 500 million and 600 million euros in every market . &quot;
the loss of food and gro@@ c@@ eries and at the quantities of Met@@ cas@@ hs High Fi@@ x cost base could cost Met@@ a roughly 13 million dollars in profit from interest and taxes . Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
&quot; at the same time Met@@ allic Money @-@ shares in the East @-@ states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey of Roy Morgan found out that Ig@@ A @-@ purchases are the most faithful . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley participates that Met@@ cas@@ sonne revenues in a food and grocery store by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 to reduce 4.2 percent in 2017 and 2.@@ 1 percent in 2015 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent by 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , at a business eating in Melbourne that Met@@ a@@ Cash will probably disappear within a decade . &quot;
Met@@ ali@@ es declined to respond publicly to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
&quot; however , it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ ali@@ es with Mr Dou@@ glass last week has been in contact with Mr Dou@@ glass . &quot;
&quot; T &apos;s market share has dropped by 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and arrivals from Met@@ cas@@ hs food and food trade , which has been supplied by 43 percent , which is since 2012 by 43 percent , which is reflected by operating high level pressure on turnover and margins . &quot;
the wholesale distributor gets however and is investing more than 150 million euros to deliver islands prices with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ é@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and Ig@@ A retailers in improving their stores by fast growing fresh food products and deliver a better choice of private @-@ label foods .
&quot; Met@@ cas@@ hs &apos;s main business manager Ian Mor@@ rice says that price adap@@ tations and loading program to el@@ ons are made , and hopes that the wholesale distributor in 2017 will return to growth in four years . &quot;
Than@@ x Associ@@ kin@@ ou is supported by the president of the Australian tennis association with Steve He@@ aly .
Than@@ x Kok@@ kin@@ ou deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour .
Than@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ akis was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damages &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and deserves praise of the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly rather praise the critics for his / her own behaviour .
&quot; Kok@@ te@@ aki , the younger of talented du@@ os , which is repeatedly referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s &quot; , accompanied by the in@@ famous examination of K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA with the Montreal Masters into the spotlight . &quot;
&quot; at a fi@@ ery qualification game in Cincinnati , Kok@@ kin@@ da and his opponent Ryan Harrison was separated twice by the refer@@ ee while Harrison : &quot; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have hit K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os , and I should hit the child . &quot;
&quot; last seen , as he was seen a tennis r@@ ack@@ et , after a cr@@ amp@@ f ev@@ apor@@ ates a potential US @-@ open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , the co@@ kin@@ dest was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth in the competition behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ finals against Great Britain . &quot;
one thing about which I con@@ j@@ ed myself pretty much is the fact that after my view than@@ asi a little in the dispute said He@@ aly .
&quot; he has broken a r@@ ack@@ et , when he lost for a cr@@ amp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who broke his r@@ ack@@ et from frustration with himself , and I know T@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he got a great family around him , and I think he was a bit too high . &quot;
&quot; he is a very devoted 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on he &apos;s never a problem with the other players , he was trained hard , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I believe he deserves to be judged on his own merits . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to take K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os in key decision @-@ making , which begins on Friday and he describes the &quot; &quot; common decision &quot; &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term steady element into the team . &quot;
&quot; first we hope that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all of the controversy is cir@@ cl@@ ed &#91; K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; I believe that Nick was made aware of what people like fe@@ ather and Mur@@ ray . he goes into the eyes of the public , and he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism that he gets , but we try to make him comprehensible , and it is best for the team and it &apos;s best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains Not@@ with@@ standing , closing the border line to refugees back &quot;
Hungary explains the emergency and ri@@ pped the south@@ border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all who tried to escape illegal into the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
&quot; chaos followed at the border , when hundreds of migrants engaged in a land of unrest and Serbian officials with rebellion . &quot;
&quot; people who have escaped from violence stub@@ born for an un@@ familiar time in a land strip at the road between the two lines of control of the countries and built up tents , and settled down there . &quot;
but frustr@@ ations went up .
&quot; as a police helicopter above them sli@@ pped , the migrants &quot; open the border ! &quot; and sh@@ allo@@ y insul@@ ts against Hungarian poli@@ cem@@ an . &quot;
some reported from protest food and water .
&quot; serving foreign ministers , it is &quot; unacceptable , &quot; that immigrants from Hungary were sent back while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral .
&quot; during the coming days talks with Brussels and other countries , I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence at the ung@@ u @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ bloc with a deb@@ atable meeting in Brussels failed to agree a common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the Ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought to shr@@ ink Italy and Greece . they oppressed their hopes that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be achieved that the EU states would pick up more than 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , continued its hopes not to return soon to Brussels or from its neighbours . &quot;
&quot; the emergency measures in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so they were able to cur@@ fe@@ ws streets and asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to told him that his country is also preparing the construction of a bar@@ bed wire , along its border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - having had an fence at the Serbian border . &quot;
CB@@ S News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even jail sentences were used in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has been a significant shortage of refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East into a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and entry into the European Union . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban had insisted that most incoming economic migrants are on the search for a better life and not a threat of war , a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws that came into effect at midnight in Hungary , make crossing the border or the damage of 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high weighing on the government along the southern border with Serbia , for a crime . these laws are also laying higher de@@ tract for de@@ aler@@ ships . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation arose through the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency situation , &quot; said government spokes@@ man Zol@@ lik@@ on K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the Southern city of Sz@@ eged . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree with the military use of the military , which will be expected for next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavy soldiers tied to armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs already for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advisor for Or@@ ban , said that authorities spend 45 people trying to cross the border to cross the border , 15 others were already penetr@@ ated into the country . &quot;
they come over by being ashamed of the fence ; they are now in custody and acc@@ uses the detention of criminal off@@ ences by the new laws .
authorities are quick to fix the fence quickly .
&quot; Hungarian officials joined in Tuesday morning two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a train carri@@ ages with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos conver@@ ts the most important border crossing , near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians re@@ opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and op@@ pressing a crowds to push themselves out there . &quot;
&quot; approximately 20 could succeed , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
a further group of migrants blocked the most important highway network between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would deny food and water until they should travel to Hungary .
vote @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s edge before Ber@@ nie s@@ anders in national pol@@ l
&quot; the ex @-@ Secretary of Hill@@ ary Clinton remains a double @-@ digit advantage in the democratic race at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie s@@ ander wins her towards the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton is now in support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ election ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders had second position , 27 percent ( rise by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not announced yet to show whether he is President of the Russian President , shall obtain support for 15 percent of the Democratic voters of the elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the beginning of pre @-@ elections , most of the Democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion stands to which candidates will support them . &quot;
but Clin@@ ton supporters are more enduring than any of the other candidates in their choice .
&quot; since the CB@@ S News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ ander has achieved some winn@@ ings . &quot;
Clinton keeps a big head with men and moder@@ ates but these le@@ aps have dimin@@ ished .
&quot; your support for the men has declined significantly , and S@@ anders can only be back with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; clinics in the benefit of democratic pol@@ ders under 50 years of sho@@ ots , and they and S@@ anders are now on the same level . &quot;
&quot; however , Clinton has a big head start with the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month , Clinton talked with a double @-@ digit advantage for the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has got a 5 @-@ point head start at this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic voters of the presidential election have widely say that Clinton would support them with enthusiasm when nominated by the party .
one quarter she would support them with a few and another 15 per cent would support them only because it is a candidate .
six percent would not support them .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ ton &apos;s current supporters are very excited about it in particular .
the views are more mixed with those who didn &apos;t like to support Clinton - only about one quarter she would love to support them .
&quot; while 48 percent of democratic voters of the pre @-@ election believe they want to support Clinton and enthusias@@ tically , say less Republi@@ can voters do this over their leading kan@@ di@@ daten Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; when Clin@@ ton supporters in an open question asked why they want that it has the correct experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time that a wife is president ( 13 percent ) and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 % ) . &quot;
&quot; from Clin@@ &apos;s supporters , her connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned . &quot;
&quot; consent to dealing with the problems and the fin@@ e@@ ability are also quoted . &quot;
&quot; since the vice president thro@@ ws a potential for the President of the presidential elections , 57 percent of the Democratic vot@@ er elections would see him in the race - even though a third believe he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked of the elections , who for the party would be their second choice , Bi@@ ot is at the top . &quot;
&quot; from Clin@@ ton &apos;s tra@@ ilers , more than half are saying that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; decides not to run on the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton is stepped onto the lead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ den in the competition to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty percent of democratic voters want to see , as a candidate , with the best opportunities to win the election ; however , this figure has decreased by 78 per cent in the last month . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ den rose by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that he sees as the most &quot; selected &quot; has increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters ask questions about the elec@@ torate . &quot;
similarly as in the last month no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for that voters of the pre @-@ election was not acceptable .
the Democratic Candi@@ date or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics of the constitu@@ encies of their party .
&quot; maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ ander and Bi@@ den as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ ds cuts the three candidates most from honesty , while achieving the strength is the leadership . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many say this about S@@ ander ( 15 % ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinion from him . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections also look like Clinton , S@@ ander , and Bi@@ ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; with all of these measurements , a quarter of democratic voters has no view of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton is continued to continue using a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as Foreign Minister , most of the Democratic voters of the pre @-@ election are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions were not influenced in overall . &quot;
but it is another story in the American public overall .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their statement while only one third is satisfied .
&quot; public opinion about this happened in March , shortly after the problem came out at the light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no effect on their general opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that her opinion has still deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; they are mainly Re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of ten who say that their views of Clinton have become worse . &quot;
although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by the voters of their party as honest and trustworthy it is a problem for them under registered voters an overall : only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy and eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote they do not consider an honest and trusted person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of the vote nationwide have also not considered p@@ umping as not honest and un@@ trustworthy . &quot;
Clinton and Tr@@ ump will receive some good notes on management .
&quot; of the six tested candidates in Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best in honesty . &quot;
&quot; a majority looks somewhat rather honest , but as at Car@@ son many do not have any view from him . &quot;
&quot; the error rate for the sample , from 3@@ 51 DR voters in the pre @-@ election is 6 percent@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; Ben Car@@ son moves to the country in China , near to Donald Tr@@ ump &quot;
Ben Car@@ son is home to the latest survey of CB@@ S News / New York Times and Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; in the two Candi@@ dates meanwhile , half of the support of voters in the new survey , and others lose dramatically . &quot;
republi@@ can voters continue to support nationwide Tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support grows from 23 % in the latest CB@@ S survey conducted in front of Fox News Deb@@ ate last month in order to 27 % in survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son sho@@ ots over the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
&quot; the survey was also noted , that Car@@ son arrives in demographic groups and is superior to Republi@@ can voters with higher education . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Governor John Ka@@ ach , is struck with Wis@@ dom in Governor Scott Walker , which is the deepest liked , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; the former Florida @-@ Governor Je@@ b Bush , former Governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are located at 6 % in the third place . &quot;
&quot; the troubles@@ hooting at the sample of 3@@ 76 persons by Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % , and was carried out in September . &quot;
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / Or@@ c survey , published last week shows that Car@@ son entered the surveys - he arrives at 19 % support in Re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot;
the most recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post showed also p@@ umping clearly before Car@@ son .
&quot; looking at one of the last week &apos;s rising Car@@ son took Tr@@ ump some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son apologi@@ zed to question a specific influence . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a show @-@ show in Iowa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; also when leading values are measured only in the distance , enough for beach vacations , there is already a trip to the Mediterranean in order to still be found in the warm waters . &quot;
a dip in the north or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short of a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people no longer go into the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees , the water in the North and Baltic Sea took place during this week , shares the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , bath temperatures still facing the Mediterranean : in the east it even comes up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , there are 25 degrees in the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Con@@ frat@@ ernity used with the death of a Bar@@ uch scientist
&quot; almost two years after a student during a cran@@ ial ritual at a student service in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , M@@ ord@@ an@@ tend to be filed against 5 people . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ SI attacks attack Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory person in September 2013 , refused to leave his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death . &quot;
&quot; officials told him to have been loaded with a 30 @-@ day back@@ pack full of sand , and repeated , while he tried to go over a frozen field on a target . &quot;
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ ache ; then he fell unconscious .
members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ SI Brotherhood did not retrieve the emergency number 911 that den@@ g was power@@ less and waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital so the police .
&quot; however , they had the time to alternate D@@ eng@@ s clothes , his symptoms to goo@@ gle and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to solic@@ it advice , &quot; Pro@@ st@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at that point , the members of the Society were invited to hide and set the welfare of the Brotherhood basically above that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Pro@@ st@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved and he died following his wounds the next morning .
&quot; after a car report , Den@@ g is repeated with mu@@ ters strength injury to head , trunk and thi@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies in 1970 every year , said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family represents , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; breaking br@@ other@@ hoods and its members must be held to account and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e received an indictment for murder of the third gra@@ dient for the first five members .
&quot; two @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with a criminal attack and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to blame the persons involved , but if there is an organization which has - officially or in@@ official - this sanc@@ tioned , we will also hold them to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood re@@ vo@@ ke its affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed will increase interest rates
&quot; a will will increase , and the house@@ se will be in charge of stepping up for loans , and the economy will be sli@@ pping into a recession . &quot;
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the story of the economy is only little instructions on the process . &quot;
a recession came to the first rate of interest within 11 months and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ siveness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , albeit not always , one factor in the way that the economy and the financial investments respond . &quot;
&quot; hence , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have stressed so fur@@ ious that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in effect , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; in the end , market participants could find that the whole excitement because of inser@@ tion might be exaggerated . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inevitably interpreted by some as a signal to the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Economics at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level in order to fear the se@@ is@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a state of historical trends taking a look at how some areas of the economy might react :
how the market has seen last month can render the loss of inser@@ tion things for a while volati@@ le .
&quot; once the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that assets do not det@@ ects 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps once again reflected the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a newer study of what happens after inser@@ tions of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; specifically , the market has in the past 35 years is mostly in warming - about 14 percent - on the way to the place insert , then back to the normal level after 500 days , with an average yield in previous six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis that Bob D@@ oll , chief system strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ern@@ s Asset Management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tend to occur later in the verification cycle and returns its return to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions include a fact of economic life , but inser@@ tions often promote them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , F@@ ed is faced with some conditions which didn &apos;t previously exist and which could speed up a recession . &quot;
&quot; extremely remarkable is that the gross Dom@@ estic Product will be near the lowest point in a inser@@ tion , the F@@ ed . &quot;
the Deutsche Bank raised a total of 118 sub @-@ inser@@ tions since 1950 than 4.5 percent .
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.@@ 6 percent , a few expect this to continue and expect the third quarter to receive the Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ tions in an so fragile economic setting could be risky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; whether this time is different &quot; , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants have made the inser@@ tion of the F@@ ed for the whole year , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week set on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could have an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trading will only be a 25 percent chance . &quot;
&quot; in our study all the cycles of 1950 to today have taken place at a super @-@ cycle with expon@@ ential momentum in GDP , and it was recently trained as rec@@ essions of the recovery in the shadows before beginning of recovery . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , whom the F@@ ed has been awaiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these have been 74 months . &quot;
&quot; the firm income was also volati@@ le , since the market takes place in the market , and the pattern is quite similar to the market . &quot;
&quot; the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than with shares , if that change its strategic path . &quot;
the time of bonds appear to change the direction as soon as the first increase / reduction in the cycle occurs .
&quot; at the end of the height @-@ cycle the lawyers drop immediately , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
the strateg@@ ist of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to push the di@@ version between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atter of the curve .
&quot; high @-@ ins@@ isting bonds often bring better yields in such climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ stin from Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interesting is , Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the drop in infl@@ ation@@ ary expectations , there are a few signs that the market adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates are increased , the growth rate is fl@@ atter , stra@@ ddle have increased and the volati@@ lity of the market has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed intensified its strategy . &quot;
&quot; large and entire companies , which benefit the greater proportion of its operations in the United States , benefit from interest rates , and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debts will be worse , as an increasing number of dollars will make their products on the global market more expensive and just as much financing their debt . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; and &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; tend to respond positively to just three months after an initial failure , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customer . &quot;
&quot; companies with strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed companies with narrow balance sheet after each of the inser@@ tions in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percent@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; companies with high capital revenues , as well as low volumes in their shares also exceeded their counterparts of low quality by an average of 4 ( percent@@ ages ) and 3 ( percent@@ ages ) . &quot;
debt is a big problem .
&quot; today , companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most , &quot;
outside of the pure share games consumers will also benefit through the increasing amount of dollars .
&quot; savings could see profits from higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are , how quickly this will take place . &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM controller Dr. Spe@@ akers Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; conservative member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the transm@@ itter due to its &quot; &quot; sealing &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly unable to distinguish from commercial ri@@ vals .
&quot; he was also looking forward to the BBC Music Awards , and said that she has been im@@ it@@ ated only The Br@@ its . &quot;
&quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins , on the show The Voice on and said that this was not quite original . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , maintains a leading parliament@@ arian member and increased new pressure on the transm@@ itter to demonstrate that he does something the private sen@@ ders do not . &quot;
&quot; conservative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses , that the publicly @-@ legal radi@@ os@@ ens@@ er &quot; imp@@ lied &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from his commercial ri@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like the word &quot; silly &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he was also involved at the BBC Music Awards , which began last December . &quot;
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , appeared to be only a different name to The Br@@ its . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples , wher@@ ein you actually only im@@ itate anything that is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC @-@ General &apos;s Director rejected the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 will go far ahead of its commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to live music and education .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I will not learn anything else about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music @-@ making that really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the dedication of Radio 3 , to find new music and to give new works , I also consider important &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; earlier this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that harder to start working to get the audience just as it did in the past , because the British are less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 was not the only element in BBC @-@ production , which during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport for doing so , the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory MP , Dam@@ ien Col@@ lin attacked The Voice for - the musical talents show at the BBC , which was purchased by Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for a cost of 22 million £ . &quot;
&quot; see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not especially distinctive ? &quot;
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - &apos; was produced on a special BBC manner .
&quot; he added that he &apos;d like the company &quot; &quot; a hit from our in @-@ house barn &quot; &quot; when the next time there is a entertainment series . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from other rows of The Voice in the future or to issue money from the de@@ posit@@ ors for other entertaining formats . &quot;
Internet Con@@ seals climbed up in August on the slow and the Black Friday may be responsible for it
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there have been seven percent increase in online selling . &quot;
the last month was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago through the use of mobile phones to purchase
&quot; experts believe that the Black Friday slo@@ wed down its issues in November &quot;
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shop has dri@@ lled , and many of the main shopping streets of Great Britain have transformed into gh@@ ost cities . &quot;
&quot; but experts say that there are now signs that the online turnover is st@@ agn@@ ant , after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; spending on August , the total increase in growth since the start of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase from the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
experts say that there are indications that online sales will st@@ agn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , then this has developed over the course of time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ RG members of the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that the online sales grew , three years ago , started as buyers , with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now the one com@@ mu@@ te , and we may see that growth decreases . &quot;
&quot; the Black @-@ Friday @-@ phenomenon , which was imported from America is cited as a reason for the analyses . &quot;
experts believe that shop@@ pers stop their purchases before this event each held on the last Friday in November .
&quot; last year five times the average number of buyers for their computers to make their bar@@ gain , and some retailer sites were starting . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that black Friday , in which buyers would be fighting against bar@@ gains , buyers from it , buy purchases . &quot;
&quot; a study conducted by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium , was that by spending 5 £ a little bit more than 1 £ . &quot;
&quot; with some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web @-@ shops . &quot;
at the same time he buys more than a quarter of people &apos;s clothing and shoes online rather than in the fashion jewellery in the cities .
Muslims are buried in Mecca at the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family will sanc@@ tioned
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Moslems with the first funer@@ als in Mecca , represented by the streets . &quot;
Saudi Arabia sets the collapse in part of the huge Sau@@ dic Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group .
&quot; the Ministry of Health said , that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane rus@@ hed . &quot;
hundreds of Muslims gathered together when 29 of the victims were carried out by the streets to bury the victims that were killed when a crane to Mek@@ ka Grand mosque .
&quot; fully filled , filled mostly in white , the distance to z@@ oning for her respect as the first of the dead gave her last trip to Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ isse@@ z @-@ cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the funeral par@@ sed went over to the Holy Sites , where only days before , the mosque , through the ceiling of the mosque , and then on the expan@@ ses . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king compl@@ ained about the building company of the Bin Laden for the catastrophe , which also left 3@@ 94 for a catastrophe . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 Be@@ es , who were killed , when a crane covered by the large ca@@ mo@@ b Mek@@ ka , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m not@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane l@@ ore . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was talking to his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ in in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officials have already announced that the p@@ add@@ ling after Mecca were moved by thousands , who continues to come to the city . &quot;
&quot; today , King Sal@@ man , the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group would not have borne the arm of the sick , than he did not use . &quot;
&quot; an Arabic version of the Dec@@ s@@ lug , which was published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group would be accountable for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language service of the news agency does not report that detail , but said that the management of the company abroad must be prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man was to di@@ vul@@ ge to what over@@ threw the overthrow of the sick , who rus@@ hed to a courtyard of the Grand mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims before the p@@ add@@ ling followed later this month . &quot;
the Bin Laden publishes no statements about the collapse of the Cran@@ e and their representatives were not available for an opinion .
the Royal Dec@@ ree was also bl@@ amed the group because of not present security measures and because they co @-@ operate with Meteor@@ ologist .
&quot; dozens of kr@@ ates surround the Mek@@ ka Grand mosque as part of the massive construction process , which is headed by the Bin Laden . &quot;
the Bin Laden has been linked with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is taking over bigger construction projects .
&quot; the late @-@ died leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a dis@@ loyal son who was acqu@@ itted of the family in the 1990 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; the overthrow of the Cran@@ e was placed in the midst of heavy winds and rain , a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for pilgrimage , which is required at least once in a life of any healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials told that 15@@ 8 people stay in the hospital .
representatives mil@@ ked in order to pay 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to the members of the fat@@ alities and to the same result permanently dist@@ res@@ sed .

&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said , she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are affected by women . &quot;
at the moment they weigh the men .
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends , showing more female single households , the more renov@@ ations are than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branch . &quot;
we have to move this stronger back to balance .
&quot; basically , half of our clients of women consist of 80 percent of decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a big role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry who is one of only five women elected at the top of a British im FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index and also accompanied her top team to reflect a equal number of men and women in executive positions .
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company , who has occupied just 50 percent of the team with women , including management and financial management . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a deliber@@ ate decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ fis@@ her re@@ produces a decline at half @-@ year &apos;s gain and the movements , after the group received the cost of closing the stores . &quot;
&quot; due to the trend , King@@ fis@@ her , Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q has 200 new branches . &quot;
functional von A@@ ich / DO@@ B because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity before judgment
at the State Court of Kla@@ gen@@ furt on Wednesday morning two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball field A@@ ich / DO@@ B was responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and tran@@ scription .
the def@@ endants are not guilty .
one of them had been charged with abuse of authority .
from this accus@@ ation he was freed in May .
the current process has been ad@@ jour@@ ned .
&quot; according to upper state tor@@ ney Robert Ri@@ ffel ( pre @-@ examination ) , the accused , in 2006 to 2011 , proved to have been mon@@ ies from the bank accounts in 2006 to 2011 , by the disp@@ ose of private purposes , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage is based at around 400@@ ,000 Euro . &quot;
the Sport@@ s@@ ars are also charged due to financial reviews .
&quot; the fact was divided by the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ sen@@ sen@@ ate , Ri@@ chter@@ in Micha@@ ela Mu@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; for the pro@@ clamation of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence force that the association at no time was a asset . &quot;
&quot; the Sport@@ s@@ ists would have not have had any compensation and the Sport@@ club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the pas@@ va bore around 600@@ ,000 sh@@ illing ( approx . 44@@ ,000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; back then we stood before the situation : do we keep the club ahead or lock ourselves up ? &quot; , &quot; told one of the def@@ endants , in the Br@@ ot@@ tom@@ an wholesale farm . &quot;
he then decided to take over this task with his colleague and co @-@ def@@ endants .
with all risks .
&quot; we have advanced money , which laid down our life insurance as safety at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said in acceptance . &quot;
&quot; agreed with the association : you can manage the money freely , there is only no debts . &quot;
furthermore it was - with the financial - success the payout of the stimul@@ i had been taken back by the end of 1991 .
&quot; therefore one part of the allowance should be paid for only years later , namely from 2003 , when one Plus on the account had been paid off . &quot;
&quot; therefore , flat @-@ shell and not detail ab@@ out@@ ings , explained the former Ob@@ man explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and savings books managed the two def@@ endants in common , said the second accused . &quot;
why the non @-@ payments of the association had not been disclosed in detail than the judge issued .
&quot; the association hasn &apos;t been interested in the financial link@@ age , important for the freedom of debt , be the answer . &quot;
&quot; more than in the year 2011 against the official investigations into the office of Ministers , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the club account . &quot;
&quot; these were necessary , said the def@@ endants . &quot;
&quot; in the name of this document , this securities went up to the name of the second def@@ endants , and according to the declaration issued by the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; , &quot; wanted to know the judge . &quot;
then the patient did not know a response .
&quot; then he said , he believed that this was the best for the association . &quot;
&quot; if it had happened to him , no one would have known something of this money , the pro@@ secutor had in the room . &quot;
the co @-@ accused would have been informed ; right @-@ handed himself the function@@ ary .
the refer@@ ral was formulated as a &quot; ren@@ dition . &quot;
why har@@ ming am@@ ends ? judge At@@ zer and At@@ tor@@ ney wanted to know .
&quot; the first accused , who had not agreed to this formulation , because the association had never been caused by the association . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; with whom you are all out of the hook . &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary , he never sour@@ ced to a pen@@ ny content , I merely comp@@ uted o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ eting . &quot;
&quot; for di@@ eting , he has issued an account of 1,000 euros per month , but the actual work had been much higher than he added . &quot;
precise documents for the early years could not demonstrate the accused .
&quot; these were after a plant , in which everything has been judged to be correct , would not have been kept . &quot;
o@@ dom@@ eter also had the second co @-@ accused .
&quot; all re@@ alis@@ ations are made in cash , from this place he will have to go to the Bank from his place of residence to the bank , he declared in his statement . &quot;
the main hearing is being continued on September 23 with the survey of witnesses .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard takes another 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition , for three years current recruitment drive , the computer opponent will build further jobs in the repair of the company . &quot;
the input holes in the US computer Sh@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) can find no end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the U.S. technology group plan to reduce the reduction of 25.000 till 30,000 points in its corporate account strategy . &quot;
&quot; in this way , costs of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are saved , shared the company on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special load of about $ 2.7 billion , which will drop from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the extraction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed . &quot;
&quot; HP was charged at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , approximately 30@@ 2,000 people . &quot;

&quot; in the third quarter of July , the sales volumes of PC and printers went back by 1@@ 1.5 per cent . &quot;

this increases the proceeds of 15 of 16 quarters .
HP answers with a spl@@ itting and massive inst@@ alls on the change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year old company under the direction of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has responded to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and are getting more and more shops done online .

R@@ ös@@ sen@@ ke : violence of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police have fought at the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ as@@ eng@@ a and waterfalls against several hundred internally displaced refugees .
Eur@@ one@@ ws @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Boz@@ kur@@ k has witnessed the flow of violence at the border control point .

a group of refugees broke the border .
behind that there was a police line and behind the poli@@ c@@ emen there stood a water head@@ lights .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees , with bricks , sticks and plastic bottles after the officials . &quot;
the officials were first sitting un@@ broken pepper spray .
after that the police force them cour@@ te@@ as .
much Tr@@ as@@ eng@@ a became spr@@ inkl@@ ed in the direction of refugees .

the refugees are still waiting for a long time standing .
a pregnant woman and obviously the last woman was carried away from the zone .

&quot; also , the spokes@@ person of the Serbian police suffered injuries by the use of tr@@ ums and pepper . &quot;
the decision of the decision on interest rates for the US staff
&quot; the world ob@@ serves when the US staff will come together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the importance of whether for the first time since almost a decade or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were interviewed by Re@@ uters , found that a little more than half , which was last week &apos;s view , that the F@@ ed will still persist a bit longer and keep interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest on N@@ UL@@ L . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , we approach the situation in which a large central bank could possibly leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Mr U@@ bi@@ des , Chief Executive Officer at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is at a relatively good power state , tri@@ llion dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate just a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude view of global conditions . &quot;
&quot; she has warned markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a step are good . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 20@@ .00 : 00 CET on Thursday
fri@@ lls at Delta State University leaving exc@@ uses
&quot; after the shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later started his colleague in prison , Sh@@ annon wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; for the first murder and wanted to &quot; &quot; he could never do it &quot; , &quot; announced government on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi ; he said that he was a lec@@ turer for geography and social scientific education at Delta State University , calling number to 10 : 00 am Monday morning . &quot;
&quot; and he said , I have shot and killed someone . &quot;
he told Paul &apos;s staff of emergency services that police officers should dispatch to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he also said that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house , but who will &quot; &quot; no one distur@@ b &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the call@@ ers for his name , but he didn &apos;t give him . &quot;
he was not an explanation for his kis@@ ses .
&quot; when the police turned into the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice of Lamb , 45 , the said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry I could und@@ o it . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note I took over 300 miles to Delta State University , where he emigr@@ ated Schmidt , a professor of history , killed before he finally took his own life on Monday night when police officers him . &quot;
&quot; earning president William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know about a conflict between Paul &apos;s and Schmidt , but , of course , there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , which supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ s had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there was no information , no evidence whatsoever for a &quot; three @-@ relationship relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the desc@@ endant was desc@@ ended from Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that she was married about seven years , as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced before 15 years ago , but they remained friends . &quot;
&quot; o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ enti@@ sts would have a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; at the bottom . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss her daughter &quot; was &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to the statement of L@@ ins@@ day K@@ now@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss &quot;
K@@ now@@ les told that Pr@@ enti@@ ologist who owned a dog named Light@@ ning themselves had represented with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; said K@@ now@@ les &quot;
&quot; said the police officers was sum@@ mon@@ ed at a particular time on Monday to say to them , &quot; &quot; he will not go to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when poli@@ cem@@ an took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later that night , he moved his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
he was in the spring 2015 from the Delta State University to put a doc@@ torate on the University &apos;s website .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is building the Group around
Lufthansa plans for a large group of companies .
&quot; a total of one billion euros per year is meant to save the Lufthansa enterprise alone , with a better organization . &quot;

&quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to some 500 million euros per year from the cost of cost and dis@@ qualification , the airline shared the airline on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; amongst other things , there is no more board for passenger operations in the future . &quot;
the Bil@@ o@@ idal Euro@@ wings should be developed as independent as possible for this purpose .

&quot; Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United could not play for a monthly &quot; &quot; monthly &quot; &quot; frac@@ ture &quot;
&quot; Luke Sha@@ w suffered at the Champions League of Manchester at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven a double down of his right guy . &quot;
&quot; while this won the left margin available to wines and exclude him for at least six months of games , Louis van Ga@@ al is not giving hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a rel@@ ent@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w had fallen into the PS@@ V range .
he was treated nine minutes on the pitch and required oxygen before he was transferred to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double bass foundation and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will move tomorrow or maybe a day later and then it will be operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , who is very difficult and then fantastic , and then it is done . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
&quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double question then it will take six months and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be afraid to escape a red map and a hanging of an el@@ f@@ ard .
&quot; Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ er , have not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al ackno@@ wle@@ dges that the Italian refer@@ ee was mistaken .
&quot; they can judge for themselves , if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card was over@@ due . &quot;
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et at Sha@@ w &apos;s account : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how kap@@ ut I am , my path to recovery now , I come back more quickly . &quot;

&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said , &quot; It is a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad . &quot;
it &apos;s never an intention of any player to hurt an opponent .
&quot; Mor@@ eno suffered a leg , when Mexico was playing with Van Ga@@ as the Holland @-@ team during the 2014 World Cup . &quot;
&quot; he is doing very hard because it was not his intention to violate the opponent , and if you then hear it is a very terrible violation , this is not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was travelling in another direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; talking to S@@ BS@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard this can be . &quot;
I feel very bad at all . I am so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Guar@@ dad@@ o was taken into the hospital again - after a f@@ oul@@ try by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron know The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that loves all parents soon : if your child loves a book , it will not last long before you know it almost maneu@@ ver@@ able . &quot;
&quot; unless , you are David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite child &apos;s book was asked , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which was awarded by Dr. Se@@ uss , 1971 . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , she writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children because it seems always an image or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the subsequent paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the action of the book instead , instead add a content to the movie version of 2012 , adding the new characters and details to expand the fairly short original text . &quot;
&quot; amid@@ st the w@@ alled city of Th@@ un @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y , met the girl of his dreams , ful@@ fills her desire to view a true tree by reading her desire to see a real tree , he reads , however , completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if this was not yet suspect enough , the text featured on the website of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the site of the Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ urg@@ o Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y , to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; though he is giving up a prag@@ matic father , it seems impro@@ bable that Cameron &apos;s action of the book is so little familiar . here an unpleasant boy , such as the local environment through the cas@@ ing , blues , thro@@ po@@ orer beings , &quot; &quot; which says in the name of the trees &quot; &quot; is desol@@ ated . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not pre @-@ read The Lor@@ ax with 20 times a row .
a Down@@ ing @-@ Street @-@ Spre@@ ader said that the text was probably come by Mr Cameron &apos;s constitu@@ encies .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text by Camer@@ ons has been delivered , but gave no further direct comments . &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion of England &apos;s team but it is still hard .
&quot; to encounter Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when you selected the Ka@@ der that has chosen the UK for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series is not on my card . &quot;
I would not exclude a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; A@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks page is possibly less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin@@ offs in Batt@@ ing list , and the spirit @-@ spirit is strong ; they will be wearing any scar of 2012 only one you@@ thful opinion . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali is developed as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an un@@ familiar magnitude on the test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
&quot; in terms of message : Adam Ly@@ th is desc@@ ended from the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der , and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th to be natural for me as his head @-@ head in Yor@@ k@@ shire , it &apos;s hard to analyse . &quot;
&quot; at his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but tough reality is that po@@ cket@@ finder aimed at results . &quot;
&quot; there were no question of Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination as - and I told this - players are choosing their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , the course of Ly@@ th would have been prolonged , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
if he hopefully lead further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire it comes another chance .
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor was praised his attitude , even if he did not get such good performances , and he does not surprise me ; he is above all a team @-@ man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test perc@@ ussion is received in order to put his mark is difficult .
he got seven opportunities - like Sam Rob@@ son in front of him - when Nick was nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play it home and back@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that one can lift up was that England first came up Jonathan told in the Caribbean this year - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer I estimate up high . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw from Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season , when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he has to maintain at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends of course on the team &apos;s engagement in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to let Mo@@ een go next to Cook , which would draw an extra @-@ spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and four Qui@@ et would be effective , and I have nothing about it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer could not hit there , and this link@@ age already showed that he is a hot @-@ shot of cri@@ cket @-@ players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there &apos;s no big difference . &quot;
&quot; my former team @-@ mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop , before he entered the 2001 as a op@@ ener . &quot;
he immediately made a hundred ro@@ uns and looked not back .
&quot; Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ der as Back @-@ up Sp@@ inner , and in my limited contact with him he was impressed me as a young man . &quot;
people may see themselves its statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a Pun@@ t but there is no big number of backup spinning from their hands and the coach have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made a few smart additions in the trainers . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Lu@@ awar@@ es , the B@@ ats@@ man of Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
it is one of the nicest guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experiences since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and powerful use in the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he is created for the international cri@@ cket matches , as player or coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights on which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even if the news are in line with the previously mentioned . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ l@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used in the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I for my part have no problem with it . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team performers do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember the same as the players depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy to heart .

&quot; in Brighton , the TU@@ C decided on its annual general meeting that it may not like it , if they threaten the social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister climbing on summit or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they won your allies for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who is looking for an already looking future in Britain inside the European tent - &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and leaves that more and more short @-@ sighted foreign ministers and officials from some capitals had come to the point where we don &apos;t care about whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cautious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an allies , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the ministry before it looks bad for them as it did at the exagger@@ ation of hard@@ ship like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and cab@@ bage ( 16 ) . &quot;
French President François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or establishment in 2017 .
he is also a blin@@ ding force .
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government - Spain a left @-@ wing .
&quot; it is hard to imagine that she will get out a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British to help her energy better off the UK - something that they didn &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have tendencies . &quot;
&quot; therefore , perhaps some such ministers perhaps un@@ visi@@ bly take not helpl@@ ess notes , completely at the SN@@ P @-@ style , during Britain &apos;s refer@@ encing campaign in order to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , thought my friend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a Ple@@ ite , and &quot; Great Britain has won &apos;t win anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how hor@@ rors the Fle@@ et Street can be on their costs and which EU scep@@ tics is the oligar@@ chy of the press @-@ bar@@ one , but did not match when during the Tony Ben@@ n inspired referendum , that was supported by the 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they can be weak by Boris Johnson , the Opport@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists , who has held a name as &quot; &quot; EU &apos;s &quot; &quot; ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; in Brussels in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot;
with all his cra@@ ft@@ iness Ed Mili@@ band knew about who were his enemies .
&quot; this was also the med@@ ley of tax @-@ feared jack@@ ets , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ing foreign countries and the pseudo @-@ In@@ t @-@ native countries , which possess most of our great newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Blair was thought about them , but found that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one can put better ban@@ anas in order to di@@ stract him instead of being hired for lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more than Blair and Blair ed by himself as Cameron &apos;s refer@@ encing , for Blair joined the principle on the Constitution of the EU , which then disappeared in 2005 by French and Dutch voters who then opened a rear door . &quot;
the press has never denied him .
&quot; but the nice Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly cl@@ ap on the back in Westminster , - I told him that he no longer wanted to do any more for me - seems to repeat that Neil Kin@@ no@@ ck boy@@ cott , but a strategy of the 80 @-@ 4 years , a bug at that time and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take too but he has to develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ couch has left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ no official position on Europe is - I express it very friendly - in development .
he says that we should remain in a reform@@ ist EU .
&quot; well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ ps have traditional bl@@ ond fr@@ active and the wild Ge@@ fil@@ ings of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ english can probably say yes to everyone . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n &quot; but no Ben@@ n@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week said , when the sc@@ out of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ nell of a shadow Chancellor was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ he years , when his old father engaged in television focusing on his Labour cabinet office , without going to go too far and to lose his cabinet office . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys fight was even more attractive .
but to fight in order to &quot; stay &quot; under all circumstances - Ben@@ ns an expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell spoke to what J@@ C told his co @-@ rank and MEPs after all reports on the Monday night .
&quot; whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants him - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the ma@@ el@@ strom of social media , a brood @-@ place of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is correct , Cameron &apos;s no free ticket for Europe that allows him to keep lab@@ ours support in the counter @-@ campaign for a matter of course , such as Mc@@ Don@@ nell it said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic multi @-@ lay@@ outs on EU membership , in line with their naming of the loc@@ ation@@ alist economy , is not just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion under left dissi@@ dents for which the nar@@ c@@ issu@@ ance of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ m@@ atism . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities , Tom Wat@@ son has convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign against res@@ ignation , Foreign diplomats will not be oblig@@ ated to leave , in particular , to find a sense for their superi@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; why shouldn &apos;t waste Paris or Berlin political capital , but they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make concessions to the British if this can be meaning@@ less ? &quot;
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost @-@ postpon@@ ement of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded at the start on Monday of something , what was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise the report of Public Health England via E @-@ cigarettes
&quot; allegations of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking , from a meeting of 12 persons , partially with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined The Lanc@@ et by reporting that of Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigarettes .
p@@ he published the &quot; principle review &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
&quot; yet some researchers have put the bearing capacity of the data and commented on the links between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
an editorial meeting in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month takes the &quot; extra@@ ordinarily win@@ dy foundation &quot; on which he founded his most primary conclusion .
two further researchers write in BM@@ J and have asked whether the claims &apos; on stone or sand can be formed .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should deri@@ ve from evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expects that the claim implies that &quot; &quot; the present best estimate is that E @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; are based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision @-@ makers ( multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ C@@ DA ) to produce their opinions on the damages from different nicotine @-@ containing products to a synthesis . summ@@ ar@@ ised the outcome of the meeting were summ@@ ar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting called Euro@@ Swiss Health was to have obtained the executive director of British American Tob@@ acco remedies ( B@@ AT ) for an independent study .
he also wrote the references of B@@ AT to Public Health in a sustainability report ; they said .
&quot; one of the 12 participants in the meeting agreed to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the funding they received after reports before from the tobacco company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for choosing the members of the body are not supplied , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes champion , some of which also provide a range of industries in the paper . &quot;
some other participants in this session are not known for their know @-@ how in the tobacco control .
the tobacco training had also taken part in the meeting .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; conf@@ esses &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence of the damages most of the products among most criteria &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these compounds or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; allegations of p@@ he that &quot; there has been no evidence so far that e @-@ cigarettes as a means of smoking for children or non @-@ smokers were to serve .
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he said that I had previously responded to the allegations of BM@@ J before . &quot;
he said : &quot; e cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
&quot; all evidence show that health risks from e @-@ cigarettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence is eviden@@ ced by and that which is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative danger related to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 80@@ ,000 people annually die of an illness with regard to smoking , and smoking is the national health system of two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; by clear precautions of current evidence that E @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should abandon East@@ on , says former head of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should stop to give programs like the East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give her right arm &quot; for hit @-@ shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the sort of programs that will not be sent by other UK radio stations .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC for it public @-@ law programmes , which are likely to be seen by a smaller public , in hard @-@ controversial time @-@ window against the popular shows of their ri@@ vals and as BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; at the BBC Pro@@ General , Tony Hall , he said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , said Johnson , that he has tried for six years at his time at Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs might be commissioned or sends , which were also clearly demonstrated by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the senior vice @-@ communications Committee in his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the radio fee , what I do not think medium or long @-@ term for a good idea , one should at least give his production on programs that others do not want or put on order . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class window because they want to reach as widely as possible support for their future .
&quot; the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridiculous , it &apos;s natural nonsense . &quot;
&quot; said Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax fund could be financed also without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ on is another , admittedly only their own productions . &quot;
&quot; frank@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
&quot; I am trying to see myself how this is to be public @-@ right television .
I don &apos;t think this would l@@ essen the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , a contractor for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said , that the BBC is to blame for reviews because of the ambitions of the people working there , and because they believe that this is the best way to guarantee long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts made by the BBC include this again , what was the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like East@@ on . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ c programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they perform their tasks , and they can argue that they had on their apparent missions to justification of 4 billion euros broad@@ casting fees , &quot; Well , we have all those ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them into a window in which no one wanted to see them ever .
&quot; for radio fee , Johnson said the Committee : &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course , remember all , we think all that one gets a great value for 150 £ a year , but for people who are just a lot of money for the 150 £ a year , I wonder if that is true , because they do not consume much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former sky@@ line and channel 5 chief of David El@@ stein , who also stated before the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check their r@@ th@@ ian mission to educate and maintain . &quot;
he said only little by the BBC @-@ production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it &apos;s 1 % of their TV production and 0.@@ 1 % in the radio - and it should take part in public @-@ law TV broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada .
&quot; question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of TV were shown and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers alliances it should make available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ Get &apos; can control brain cells with sound @-@ waves
&quot; the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment , where they are broad@@ cast@@ ed with sound impul@@ sen . &quot;
scientists have bred the wor@@ ms with genetically modified nerve systems which can be controlled by break@@ through@@ s of sound waves .
&quot; tiny ne@@ mat@@ o@@ des change the direction in the moment they have with sound impul@@ ses , which have too high frequencies for the human hearing , to be heard . &quot;
impulses work by switching from Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that are responding to ultrasound waves .
another on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure , called Son@@ o@@ Get , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day the depths of the stimulation has been replaced by a more invasive procedure , the electrical impulses in the brain for treating the symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; sl@@ amm@@ ers usually do not react on ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani that they did when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then enter into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the enhanced ultrasound waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ en@@ li@@ als and found in the membran@@ es of some of the seas@@ oning cells .
&quot; sound waves make the opening of these i@@ onic channels and activate the cells they are associated with , so a report of Nature Communications . &quot;
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled ne@@ mat@@ o@@ des genetically modified Chal@@ az@@ ani plus the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ oring type TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels carry .
&quot; when using ultrasound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ waves and turn into the wor@@ ms , where they turn into the changed motor vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some similarities with Op@@ to@@ Get , a groundbreaking tool , the scientist allows to turn neur@@ ons with impulse of light and off . &quot;
but Chal@@ de@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ Sizegenetics has some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which has to be sent to the desired place in the brain in a optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound tissues may be sent un@@ checked and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the ti@@ sed human neur@@ ons temporarily prone to the ultrasound treatments in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director , Matt Le@@ ver was amazed at the silence , which ruled around the advertising for the force fair - and thought : &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; they played with the invention of a realistic shar@@ pen@@ ny of her@@ edi@@ ts , but &quot; &quot; blu@@ ish with bright colors and animation remains more powerful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness on the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student dormit@@ ories
&quot; eleven years ago I moved to a student dormit@@ ory , still in faith in Ber@@ et and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the tense smile of those that I forgot - and in the numerous , long @-@ wise gri@@ ev@@ ances about others . &quot;
&quot; most of what I have learned , can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules . &quot;
the student in school residences is ranging from light nerve wr@@ acking down to absolutely fri@@ ghtening .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to tell : people wh@@ ence you come , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ b@@ ang , where you do not love neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , there is only a He@@ fe@@ extra@@ kt ha@@ haha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distr@@ acts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like about in contrast to those with which you wouldn &apos;t talk , even if your lashes were stuck in fire and these cre@@ mation would be . &quot;
let people go .
&quot; the rooms of people are often transformed into drinks , film @-@ night venues and municipal gather@@ ings , but they are also the places where people dress them and their under@@ wear . &quot;
related to : do not think to start at the university with a relationship
in@@ tro@@ ver@@ ized is a rough handling at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student dormit@@ ories form a space @-@ to @-@ space blo@@ w@@ ler culture , which can lead friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
that can be the hell for someone who tried to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I will , that our friendship goes on , but you have to go away , so I get the energy back , which I used to interact with you . &quot;
&quot; try to sense when a class@@ mates is exhausted from soci@@ alizing - and simply send it a message instead of knock . &quot;
apro@@ pos ch@@ ur@@ ry : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that a non @-@ fir@@ ing door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship closes by b@@ aking .
&quot; as you begin the var@@ sity of the doors of the back @-@ man@@ ie , the Klo@@ ff@@ p is to the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less weird as the welcome of the 1950 @-@ he years &quot; welcome , &quot; so , and now please smile , if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
&quot; your room@@ mates are committed to entertain , and will most likely associate your face with a delicious surprise . &quot;
of course this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
&quot; bad mixed lot of flour , sugar and gre@@ ase lead to the fact that people sle@@ w yourself asleep , if you anchor . &quot;
to ste@@ al food is a common crime in student dormit@@ ories .
&quot; of course , the cl@@ ut@@ ches of chicken is a theft , but is it the taking of a drop of milk for your tea as well ? &quot;
check this with the entry owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even if cooking in the inner . &quot;
&quot; when somebody ro@@ bs your belon@@ gings , it is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more well than my co@@ room@@ mate , which added their milk to pun@@ ish . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make a noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not just about being a decent man , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the word to the people who sit in the glass building . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my hallway asked her neighbors , whether it made them something , drum &amp; bass something qui@@ eter to make , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test on the morning . &quot;
they broadcast them together with an older music .
when she finally heard about 5 p.m. she sent her neighbors to sleep two hours before she ple@@ aded her own music to shut her door and went on to her three @-@ hour trial .
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would happen to move into the same dor@@ m residence ?
&quot; contr@@ ari@@ y@@ wise , it &apos;s not fri@@ ghtening when you hold a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner to un@@ plug in them and then experience them each day and maybe join them as to get all common friends . &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot mate is definitely not your future marriage partner , try at least to put on your body a bit of reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice that somebody has his keys in his not closed room , the border between a ul@@ k and har@@ ass@@ ment is when it appears . &quot;
&quot; a good stroke is fun , but it only lasts moments until it becomes the bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
place by wast@@ ing a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but you never di@@ gest any one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
&quot; close your door and place their keys in a glass of water , which can be put in the freezer - but T@@ ack@@ ets you can put its possessions on the ceiling not more than twice . &quot;
&quot; terr@@ aced houses for refugees , single @-@ attracting , small @-@ ear@@ ners &quot;
&quot; the real estate owner Markus Gil@@ dner is building in the mid@@ land ver@@ and@@ ary terr@@ aced houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; for instance , for refugees - but also as a signal , &quot; &quot; not only refugees need to be living room , but the mother alone and the more deserved . &quot;
&quot; I show how to use them tonight and well , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot;
thousands of refugees will drive on the housing market .
&quot; the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly favorable housing can be created , it builds in a project &apos;s terr@@ aced houses for refugees . &quot;
Mr Gil@@ es and many refugees are displaced to the housing market .
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ es : the mass accommodation in containers or turn@@ around has no sustainability .
because people are staying here for a great part here .
&quot; given the red flow , we need enough housing in the coming decades as well . &quot;
a very mund@@ ane and three storey building is the solution .
Gil@@ es : a town@@ house needs the least rank .
it facilit@@ ates the integration .
this is different when people are sub@@ sum@@ mon@@ ed to the people in blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses , built just in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees will say , it is again peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can easily be converted to the respective needs .
how much is the cost ?
&quot; Gil@@ es : the price of 160 square meters of living per house is located on 18@@ 4 000 euros , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
six months the construction took me .
this is appropriate .
do the construction rules have their plans ent@@ complicated ?
Gil@@ es : construction legally I carried out my project correctly .
very complicated it always makes the dro@@ wning damage paper and the super@@ space regulation .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
still it is still under@@ lining who creates three apartments in a row house requires at least three pitches .
there is still room in the cities that is missing .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the inhabitants react to their terr@@ aced project ?
&quot; Gil@@ es : there were those , who did for me to prepare lux@@ uries for asylum seekers . &quot;
which is definitely not true .
&quot; however , do you not exac@@ erb@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ? &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ gen : true yet , in the last five years we have built a construction boom in Germany , but we were built according to luxury apartments , which can hardly afford more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need a living space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the mother alone or the horn @-@ ear@@ ners alone . &quot;
I show how to use them locally and well .
that is what it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system if Apple Update is published
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by opening the app @-@ app , typ@@ ing &quot; General , &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; software update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install . &quot;
some are encountered after installation to problems since they get an error message that al@@ lied that the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or trying to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .

Dr. Frank Müller to take office in the field of rock and invested € 3@@ 10000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ h@@ ausen .
&quot; in addition , Sam@@ t@@ ga@@ stri@@ ker Bernd Bor@@ mann , economist Thomas U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , has fortune to perform the practice of Dr. Frank Müller on the 1st of October . &quot;
&quot; during the UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ens@@ feast in the reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still in charge of his successor during the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after the launch phase , Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then it inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 euros in the premises at the St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight when the Fel@@ ste@@ al met , years ago Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ periodic@@ ally , who is currently taking care of the general practitioner &apos;s hospitals and commented on the practice next year . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the Mü@@ llers would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ch and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when there was so far , I just called them . &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to continue to operate in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we would like to get to know and accompany the families over the years , too . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he can see his own boss too soon . &quot;
&quot; and so , it was agreed that the Mü@@ llers are buying the house with the practice . &quot;
they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller also grew up in Hannover , its medicine studies in Hannover and hospitals in several medical offices , as well as in the hospital in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ ch@@ â@@ tel and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen . furthermore he was appointed to the Man@@ ep@@ wood District in 2009 and is engaged in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness of Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the practice will be ready for the new boss as of 19 September .
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Field ste@@ aling , his spouse works , he specialized his spouse UR@@ SE@@ L ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) for gastro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the Mü@@ llers , both Inter@@ nis@@ ts , want to settle for as a school@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy is therefore out of , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
after the re@@ building the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load @-@ EK@@ GS and need a personal room more .
&quot; furthermore , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a grant from a total of 50@@ 000 euros , the Mü@@ llers are provided under a funding programme from the County ( 25@@ 000 Euros ) and the Zambia municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continuing and says , &quot; emphasized the General Manager of Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; approximately 2000 patients , according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll each quarter in the field of rock , in the North German average practice , are approximately 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another general practitioner .
a positive low @-@ effect of the practical consideration by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains the A@@ UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ t@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no man had found himself , she would have gone . &quot;
&quot; who visits Mü@@ llers or Consul@@ tation , and by the way also remain in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical journals and the cleaning power of the fields . &quot;
&quot; their par@@ ting ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the medicine is practiced for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; UR@@ SE@@ L rock &apos;s feast @-@ breaks . &quot;
a little melanchol@@ y feel it after the long time already .
&quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ moor and will see many patients still often &quot; , &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; your husband will complement l@@ ach@@ ingly , &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; up to now , I have always been pressed ahead of gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; additionally , the couple has two grandchildren and travels like . &quot;
&quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; now the border controls will also be raised on our border line , &quot; &quot; told the Minister of Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
controls on the Hungarian border are continuing simultaneously .
&quot; just as before it is clear that everyone , who wants to make an asylum application , can also do it without saying . &quot;
the supply and safety of the people stood in the foreground .
&quot; of course , however , that it needs clear signals , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we don &apos;t accept unlimited migration flows , nor via the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia
&quot; previously , Croatian government had previously told that Slovenia wants to continue international refugees towards Austria and Germany and set cor@@ ridors for refugees also under certain circumstances . &quot;
&quot; however , the Minister of Interior in Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ am Z@@ ni@@ dar in La@@ bach did not view . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ ridors &quot; &quot; is absolutely not acceptable &quot; , &quot; but rather the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary - intensi@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia has already been highly controlled . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to strengthen its borders for refugees but not a stone . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system can not work , &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ am Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; like Croatian Government , the first refugees were already trying to step on to Tuesday in the night @-@ up to Tuesday , to travel in East Croatian at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d , in order to so@@ ften the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could resort them in the nearby corn fields .
&quot; since to the local media , we have always been meeting police vehicles with new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik . &quot;
&quot; it is mostly about Syrian and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children . &quot;
also b@@ ail@@ out services and the Red Cross are already in operation .
&quot; in the days ahead , his country will be expecting around 4,000 refugees , said Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; also , buses from Pres@@ evo in the Maced@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had formerly led migrants to the Hungarian border , led the Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday at Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the Government in Belgrade ranks however , however , that they may h@@ itting the people to make certain routes : &quot; neither can we nor do we want this , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , according to media reports , a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Ser@@ b border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day , further buses are expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the occup@@ ants had been on tour for the entire night of the Maced@@ onian border with Serbia about 500 kilometres away .
&quot; we heard that Hungary has made us , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany . &quot;
it could actually now actually happen to some of the preceding shifting of the past Balkan @-@ route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further West nearby circuit .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
&quot; Croatia &apos;s interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic , had previously stressed that his country has prepared for the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees appropriate plans for potential exceptional circumstances . &quot;
&quot; he didn &apos;t call it , but he pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot;
it must carry strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has since 2007 listened to , the EU partners present the country a good example of what concerns the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian page , behind the Hungarian border fence there will continue to be about 300 refugees . &quot;
&quot; according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media reporting , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
according to the Hungarian authorities the two border crossing of Hor@@ gos and B@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
&quot; Serbian Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stefan@@ ovic was tried at ease at a local present in Hor@@ gos : it held the debate on Altern@@ ativ@@ ly designed by refugees : after the Hungarian border is now closed , for breakfast . &quot;
it would not at present be a very high amount of refugees .
&quot; it is impossible to tell whether they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers : migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee camps have already begun to distribute the refugees to distribute the refugees on which alternative routes are marked through Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border area , there are also 20 years after the end of the parcel war still not sp@@ elled min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of de@@ mining companies in the border region was sent .

&quot; the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ it@@ all@@ ot@@ ch &quot; &quot; initiated this action to its 20 year anniversary and is entirely faced with mixed reactions . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life , therefore we are in the midst of the action in the midst of the city and the people , &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ e@@ fine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the &quot; &quot; head @-@ head &quot; &quot; mission is also available for questions and talks with volunteers as well as volunteers . &quot;
&quot; while some pas@@ ser@@ ge@@ ant searched the cra@@ yon drawing and the sentence around &quot; my life happened , &quot; &quot; we can &quot; &quot; read &quot; &quot; with the camper stop , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; not long to stand , read , say things as &quot; as far I &apos;m not yet &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again , on the si@@ delines , there are small discussions about the action itself , about life , the handling of dying . &quot;
Peter Hü@@ b@@ inger is just on site .
&quot; only when I make it clear that at some point I get the end of the world , I can responsi@@ bly live , &quot; says the director of the di@@ ac@@ onal plant Mannheim , which is co @-@ ordin@@ ated with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ k@@ association in the ec@@ umen@@ ical councils . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public is an effective action for 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; but that not everyone wants to communicate in the tables publicly , be however understandable , eventually it is a very personal matter . &quot;
&quot; the issue of death and dying is still frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ e@@ fine Lam@@ mer , though the experience of Hosp@@ it@@ fine Lam@@ mer , albeit a lot to have contributed to the fact that humans open . &quot;

&quot; when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ it@@ tering wanted by calling for volunteers , she immediately reported and was with the founding in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ def@@ roid is among a team of 45 volunteer - 43 women and two men - the concerned and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in hosp@@ ice - Saint Vincent . &quot;
all they are carefully trained .
Angel@@ ica Go@@ ist@@ roid is able to deal well with her job and his experiences and experiences .
&quot; I see life from a different angle , hold it for precious and value the moment , &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of the Amb@@ ul@@ atory E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ it@@ inary Service is free of charge and con@@ fes@@ sions .
&quot; the financial support of the health insurance and donations of relatives and associations enable the training and further education and super@@ visions of the ster@@ ling and funeral departments . &quot;

F@@ ed@@ ex @-@ results mixed with finance @-@ outlook for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports disappointing results for the last quarter and the singer @-@ gi@@ ant lowered his profitability at a whole year due to the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in his bo@@ d@@ oom service .
&quot; the company also said that she is planning to hire approximately 5@@ 5,000 of the seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time in the past year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the stock was over 2.5 percent in the Pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. An@@ no@@ un@@ ces to earn a profit between 10.@@ 40 and 10.@@ 90 in the financial year , which ends in May , 20 cent less than in previous forecast . &quot;
analysts were expecting a survey from Fac@@ t@@ set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; the lower outlook comes in spite of price increases , which can amount to an average of 4.@@ 9 percent and 4 January , and despite higher charges for bo@@ oming processes of heavy and large packages that will be accumulated from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said that it nonetheless expect the result compared to the previous year due to cost @-@ reduction , higher revenue and because of growth in on @-@ line trade . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; solid yields , &quot; if the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;

but the boom in online shopping has raised the results in F@@ ed@@ ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter sales at the Bod@@ hi@@ sport increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ assurance . &quot;

the Central Bank has a two @-@ fold mandate from the congress : maximize the US employment and prices here stable .
&quot; but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ just Third @-@ standing mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; this third mandate could be the X factor in deciding which is too tight in order to pre@@ dict them . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the U.S. economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled by the close @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the latest turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets are also anxious to increase this volati@@ lity by raising interest rate for federal government bonds - and be it only a quarter of percent@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation is primarily the most important thing to watch , &quot; said Lin@@ d@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ists at the fe@@ eder firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pretext to not increase interest rate , the increased insecurity about the global market are not justification , continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , what can be poll@@ uted in itself the financial market . &quot;
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , recently interviewed by Bloomberg , have forec@@ asted a week . &quot;
&quot; the financial markets expect a pick @-@ up of the F@@ ed , with a key indi@@ indicator , which indicates only a 30 % chance at an increase . &quot;
&quot; this points to a decline in the stock market , in case the F@@ ed raises the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists strike the strike , by promising a further increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average commen@@ dable by 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or 1,4 % to 16.@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; this action has been triggered by expectations , that the F@@ ed @-@ policy stays the sentence during this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief of Im@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if they do , &quot; &quot; she would have to go far too far in her statement to escal@@ ate the financial markets , so that they don &apos;t panic into panic . &quot;
other experts were argu@@ ing that a sales increase would coordinate the financial markets because they would resolve the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
&quot; a month ago the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first step in a slow shar@@ pen@@ ing of mon@@ ol@@ ding conditions , which would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ale had said that in spring and early summer , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , she would expect more economic progress to expect an increase in the sentence . &quot;
&quot; while the creation of jobs in August slow , the improvement on the labour market was solid . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate sank at 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years , and close to the level which F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
pay extensions have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although inflation continued continuously under the annual growth of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of much lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief of Pan@@ theon in the Macro@@ economics . &quot;
&quot; however , the financial markets around the world have reached the end of the last month after China had de@@ valu@@ ated its currency . &quot;
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ ise@@ worthy fell to more than 16 % in May in May , when investors had feared that a slo@@ wing of the Chinese economy would cr@@ ush the global growth . &quot;
this month has rec@@ u@@ per@@ ated this month and the Dow is now located almost 10 % below the month of May .
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation of the complex calcul@@ ating when you should raise the interest rate . &quot;
&quot; if events on the financial markets and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks would not have occurred , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A St@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US staff . &quot;
&quot; now he tells that she will wait at least a month , to better get the impact better . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on U.S. economy , and there are nearly no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the global economy is one of the main ones of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be involved in their decision @-@ making . &quot;
but in the end the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the central bank influence has enormous influence over the last few years .
&quot; the mere note of the then leader Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in the year 2013 that the F@@ ed could be &quot; &quot; narrow expansion &quot; &quot; is@@ k@@ ills around the world . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly ban@@ ished , by the F@@ ed representatives , they can not only monitor the developments in other places but also with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of global economy . &quot;
&quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for the asset management of the company En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA . , re@@ marked this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transi@@ tions on financial market movements that appear to be linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; dis@@ acker , the right member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which uses for a representative , utilisation decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to cut its leadership to 0.@@ 75 percent@@ ages in three sessions &quot; despite limited in@@ able effects on growth in the US , &quot; L@@ acker said . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representatives made these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability at the first place during a severe crisis such as the &quot; market reunion in 2008 , &quot; said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the interest of the Bank of England . &quot;
the most recent turmoil will not come close to this level .
&quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which they &apos;re afraid to advertise , because the markets are exciting , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still does the dual mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t believe it should be ahead of time . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive at these days in Germany .
&quot; to give you a warm welcome , does not go without the engagement of innum@@ erable volunteer volunteers . &quot;
&quot; in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , there are a number of people who are un@@ selfish in the town . &quot;
among them are Mrs and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is with body and soul master .
even with their 74 learning she is still instruc@@ ted .
&quot; every Thursday she is doing it in asylum seekers , at D@@ ill@@ inger Strasse . &quot;
&quot; there it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a very different teaching than at a real school . &quot;
Brasi@@ li@@ ans Pap@@ al @-@ Syrian society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding .
&quot; the Brazilian , pa@@ edi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS attempts to clear the shocking way women on how important good nutrition during the lac@@ tation period is . it does this with the presentation of images of babies which are painted over fr@@ en@@ ades , who are painted with portra@@ y@@ als of unhealthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins , and carbohydrates that give babies all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy demands , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that should make mothers . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet lasting women actually concerns the genes of their babies and it protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an unhealthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new amber industry
the district of Bernstein authorized the entry fee for the 2.3 million Euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar system .
&quot; the plans for the long @-@ seeing turn@@ around at the Bern@@ sm@@ elling Sport@@ area are progres@@ sing step by step well : in the most recent council meeting , the un@@ worked construction work was dro@@ wned without huge discussions . &quot;
&quot; previously , the Panel had agreed , among other things , an application for a construc@@ tional &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; of the valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; with the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; it was possible for permission to construct a special form on the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; thus , a &quot; saddle @-@ d@@ ach &quot; with non @-@ mit@@ es first and bad@@ ge . &quot;
&quot; background planning is the intended use of the building space for solar power plants : &quot; &quot; this is why we get together a wonderfully large southern part of the South , &quot; stated Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; again , on the other hand , this comes to the tends to be required for energy reasons - differently than in the development plan - under ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore needed , because the development plan applies to the a@@ version no &quot; exceptions &quot; - whereby the amber became more restric@@ tive in the motion . &quot;
&quot; however , the turn@@ around project is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we create no preced@@ ence , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the turn@@ around at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the community and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated on costs .
subsidies are expected from school and business development .
&quot; in the next process step , the entry fee for the 18 x 36 meters will now be submitted to the Federal Council for testing . &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the Hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is planned to be closed before - namely 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will be appointed as the new Doc@@ tor Hospital Manager at Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; the station , as well as the majority of the employees pull off from P@@ ei@@ k@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; these are seeing the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the coun@@ ties , the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea Jo@@ chner @-@ white confirmed . &quot;
&quot; the Supervisory Board , however , is the Supervisory Board and the conven@@ ing planned on Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans are implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees will continue to work in the hospital in P@@ ei@@ k@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority should be moved to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the further existing interior station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
&quot; the employees , which cannot be offered to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so Jo@@ chner and white . &quot;
the employees were informed about their plans .
&quot; triggered the change from the cancellation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic and now a private practice in close vicinity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; the question of who is to take the succession , according to Jo@@ chner and white , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , as of 1 October , to take charge of and to change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this is in every case a &quot; &quot; upgrading &quot; &quot; and a distribution of the range in the area of &quot; internal medicine &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ chner @-@ and &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised in gastro@@ enter@@ ologic disorders .
&quot; fishermen about the next two years should agree to Fischer with his team , when the Supervisory Board agrees to agree both houses , until then next year the former hospital of the crew , which has had more than 35 beds , has finally to be closed after nearly 140 years . &quot;
&quot; so far , the County has planned this for 2018 , as the currently running re@@ turn@@ around at Hospital Wei@@ l@@ heim has been completed . &quot;
&quot; Mr Jo@@ chner @-@ White , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , came towards the camp that the House which is owned by the Federal Reserve Unit , is in the future be used as an accommodation for asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; the end I went out . as it deals with the property , Jo@@ chner and white could not say , there are several reflections . &quot;
in the end there is a short @-@ term care of the car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ric .
&quot; what Bes@@ ser@@ es could not happen to us , such an opportunity arrives does not come back , &quot; so fishermen about the quasi @-@ moved to the Le@@ ch , who had been positively accepted by employees &quot; positively and very comprehensible . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , in which fisher@@ man works for over 30 years as a chief physician , did not exist . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to assume the post of medical director .
&quot; the Hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was always threatened in the last decades by closure , departments were closed , for example the surgery and the Obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the palms of the Rhine @-@ N@@ eck@@ ar lions are now called the evening ( 20.@@ 3 p.m. ) on the Berg@@ ischen HC now .
&quot; the leader of the Bundesliga is in Wuppertal , the clear favourite , occasion for the Arro@@ gan@@ ce event none . &quot;
&quot; during the past season , the bathing needs at B@@ HC has a painful defeat and there needs to be credited . &quot;
Jag@@ a@@ Fall of two closures with Pr@@ at@@ au
two tra@@ des@@ ks have been badly injured during their corn crop on Tuesday morning by shots .
&quot; during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a ma@@ is@@ feld near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district of Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in use , as the police officer . &quot;
after a shot - a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year old man brought serious injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it got to the accident was first unclear .
the Judi@@ cial Police were determined .
16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhein@@ land @-@ Pf@@ alz victims of non @-@ violence
a god@@ send has led the police for the cor@@ pse of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
&quot; in the inter@@ ro@@ gation of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old , the youth killed and their cor@@ pse was thrown into a canal in rock @-@ breaks . &quot;
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhein@@ land @-@ Pf@@ alz have fallen victim to a violence .
&quot; the body of the young woman was found at Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern at the Tuesday evening at Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , like the prosecution and the police on Wednesday . &quot;
this is also regarded as being suspected of 20 year old as well as 20 @-@ year @-@ old who report@@ edly arranged the declaration and conducted the investig@@ ators for the discovery site of the body .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported on Sunday mor@@ nings after going on the eve of a fall in rock enh@@ ausen no more than agreed at home .
in the search for the young woman the investig@@ ators first came to personal items of the victim .
&quot; with surveys in friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the surve@@ yed , there was eventually a crime among the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ per@@ secutor of the crime then led the police into a canal in rock breaks , where the body was found . &quot;
&quot; according to the agreed , the authorities were appointed to the police inter@@ ro@@ gation , having killed 16 @-@ year @-@ olds and put the cor@@ pse in the channel . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be guided to the port on Wednesday , and the investig@@ ators put it out to his load . &quot;
information on the nearby circumstances of the act must be taken into an additional investigation .
refugees need accommodations : study warned against housing .
the situation on the German apartment market is tense .
even more and more refugees seek a paid stay .
pressure on the housing market grows .
social housing is a challenge .
department of distribution on the German occup@@ ations have long since begun .
with incoming refugees and seekers from the EU more and more people are pushing for a market which is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
the competition will compete with a weak citizens over the last affordable housing .
&quot; in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units had to be built up to 2020 . &quot;
&quot; to this result , a study conducted by the mission of the &quot; social housing &quot; programme . &quot;
&quot; by comparison : this year , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units will be completed in Germany . &quot;
&quot; thus , 140@@ ,000 apartments are absent . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in a first @-@ term accommodation . &quot;
many then come across the apartment market and rows into the long queu@@ es before the flats .
&quot; according to Baden @-@ Federal Bundes@@ rat , however , in the last year , however , less than half of all asylum seekers can rent . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , the negative development of the housing market does not only lie at the rise of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes significant om@@ issions in the housing politics of recent years .
Germany over@@ looks a housing deficit in Germany that gets bigger from year to year .
&quot; current in the metropolitan areas were already about 7@@ 70@@ ,000 units , compl@@ ained Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many professionals therefore live in great cities of not@@ ated in W@@ G rooms .
young adults continued to stay in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the catch on the apartment market .
&quot; in the big cities , the number of square meters per head has declined in the past few years . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the alliance of &quot; social housing &quot; makes a new start . &quot;
&quot; in the process , new incentives for social housing should be revi@@ ved . &quot;
&quot; thus , it could be avoided on the grass@@ land tax and will be exposed to the basic tax for funded apartments . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an attractive tax @-@ tax gap is necessary . &quot;
the funding programme for the refugee income of the State @-@ West K@@ W is already well @-@ known in cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the launch at the end of Monday , some 300 million euros have already been called off at the Monday of Monday . &quot;
now the project could even be extended .
refugees have a free movement : Croatia and Slovenia are in the corridor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary is practically no longer able to go through , as more and more refugees choose the path of Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb An@@ no@@ un@@ ces to allow transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
&quot; however , the route is dangerous . &quot;
Croatia wants to connect with the neighboring country of Slovenia via the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian Minister of Minister , and if necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU @-@ country Croatia is still not a Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; after the shut@@ down of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia when driving from there to Western Europe . &quot;
500 people had come across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik and reports the Croatian correspondence of RT@@ L .
Hungary was closed off its border for refugees on the day before .
&quot; new laws that came into effect the same day , and this would eliminate redund@@ ant asylum practices in Hungary . &quot;
Croatia wants to pass away the refugees .
Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic declared : &quot; you can go through and we will prepare for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
but they are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
Croatian police had adopted the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU @-@ neighbouring country in the morning .
&quot; some of them are reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they arrived with the bus as well as with Ta@@ xen to the Ser@@ b border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after arriving they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
&quot; in the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees were not on the border f@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; to this , the border stri@@ ps has other dangers . there are still sharp mines of the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
de@@ mining is now to create a safe passage .
&quot; after Hungary , there are hardly any more refugees after the closing of the border . &quot;
on Tuesday the police were 3@@ 66 raised people .
shortly before tor@@ ches on Monday we have been still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws will aid us in overcoming and deterioration of the border with us as a crime .
&quot; therefore , in the south @-@ eastern border city of Sz@@ eged , there were therefore 35 cou@@ es of criminal proceedings . &quot;
death dro@@ ple@@ ts up to five years and deportation from the land .
&quot; according to the immigration authority one put up in the newly furnished &quot; tran@@ sit@@ ing &quot; on Tuesday , almost all - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; under the applicants , they were 13 families with small children and two elderly persons . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning , there were still 40 refugees left . &quot;
but practically no one has a view to obtain asylum in Hungary .
according to Hungarian opinion Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers should be de@@ ported there .
the &quot; Tran@@ sit@@ ing &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke only gathered a few hundred refugees .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke the workers began to take care of .
they gathered in the rub@@ b@@ ish behind thousands of people over the past few weeks .
threshold tol@@ ls were degra@@ ded and one of the reception camp in the border region was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express itself to the goal of this new construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Austria reached closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary only a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; around 20,000 migrants were living according to government information but still in the country . &quot;
around 1400 men are waiting for Germany and around 1400 people .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the German government directive .
another group of free@@ ware regularly met smaller groups of refugees on foot .
Mayor he &quot; tran@@ tran@@ ts &quot; over the limit
&quot; we were busy after the bridge on Sunday with the reception , when suddenly ten people were engaged with travel agencies at the entrance of the tent , &quot; as W@@ ern@@ stein Mayor Alois City . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to take the train to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; but because Germany was surprisingly closed on Sunday due to the stream flow of railway traffic with Austria , the city council , who immediately offered his help and str@@ anded together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border into the Middle Pass@@ au . &quot;
before we saw the un@@ hoped guests once more in favour of j@@ ause and drinks .
we immediately said it takes you by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; it was self @-@ evident for us , &quot; &quot; says City in O@@ Ö@@ N . &quot;
they were very grateful .
&quot; a man did not let her take a generous donation , a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; this made us very happy , &quot; &quot; says City . &quot;
&quot; the crossing train pass@@ able on Sunday evening in Wels by an ICE moved to a regional train in Direc@@ tion Pass@@ au , in order to make it possible after the short notice that the railway traffic was stopped in Germany but still trying to try the border . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional train was stopped at the Inn in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn . &quot;
in W@@ ern@@ stein it is the border crossing in general high in the course .
the Br@@ ücken@@ firm association with the Bav@@ arian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ alized - organised by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has sent more cigar@@ s into ourselves for thousands of years and is a logical result of hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; instead of helping in the camp of R@@ ös@@ sen@@ ke right in the establishment of structures that human@@ eness ensure , our Chancellor continued to capit@@ alize on the position of the Hungarian Government in the area of National Socialism . &quot;
contrary to this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now facing in the bor@@ der@@ land with chaotic conditions .
&quot; the refugees too will have to note that the &quot; &quot; wasted country &quot; &quot; that invited them and welcomed us , nothing but a further refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a major challenge facing the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter , with us to produce decent states for protection seekers . &quot;
and it will be an even bigger one - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad on the search of 3@@ 5,000 hibernation &quot;
Con@@ rad has to deal with the refugee movement all hands full .
Christian Konrad is used to give his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen band in order to cease sc@@ iss@@ ors for thousands of refugees .
&quot; the chaos in the first admission center , Con@@ is@@ kirchen has already gotten hold of Konrad . &quot;
&quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday would be without great turmoil , &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of Interior spoke in contrast by a &quot; cr@@ atic situation . &quot;
&quot; overall , Konrad was counting with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ ary year . &quot;
&quot; to fulfil the number must be found in the next weeks even 3@@ 5,000 apartments - 20,000 are to provide the countries to 15,000 . &quot;
&quot; for more refugees , we can create it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; Konrad . &quot;
he has already brought talks to the county governor .
they could have been assured of it even for the coming refugees to be treated arti@@ m@@ ly .
&quot; in Upper Austria it runs fine , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP of Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , helping to explain how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; great expectations are applied for asylum seekers as well as in the OR@@ F @-@ action , &quot; Hel@@ ps like us . &quot; &quot;
on the platform they can offer their own private and simple accommodation .
&quot; furthermore , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter . &quot;
finally Con@@ rad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed the standards for placing as &quot; very high . &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ cho@@ don@@ ors must respect a certain height of the hand @-@ holder or the size of the duties . &quot;
a must @-@ must @-@ pay for a perpet@@ ual time . &quot;
&quot; that he was successful with his experience as opposed to the Interior Ministry , &quot; reveals Konrad with his experience . &quot;
I am a older gentleman who you cannot speak without further into the face of the un@@ truths .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
&quot; finally Con@@ rad and Mai@@ er do not cause any cost , as they explained themselves . &quot;
your employees want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
the original source of receipt has not been successful yet .
finally wanted to set up a Container to square Stephan@@ splatz in the office .
&quot; however , there are apparently some problems with the permit . &quot;
Linz calls for a better division
&quot; before the opening of municipal sports halls , and other buildings like tips and design centers for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as it is impossible to accommodate the persons currently without those measures , &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emergency purposes , however , further sites should be tested on their mobility . &quot;
the critic@@ isms will be committed to the chief of the refugees among the distribution of refugees within the state .
&quot; also , other areas need to make their contribution here . &quot;
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not closed
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) the governor of Josef P@@ ag@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday for further action at the refugee question .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer also assured me that the German borders are not closed .
continued migration of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however there are now the corresponding border controls .
special excerpts from refugees to Germany won &apos;t give it any more .
the prot@@ ectors would however be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , he once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee question . &quot;
&quot; the fact that Austria leads to its limits again in Austria , is a logical consequence of the action of the Germans for &quot; &quot; Sti@@ r &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ tas@@ tic is a question of time
the Con@@ dic@@ ation of the &quot; New ship@@ yard &quot; at the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially completed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is drawn , the rest ( 2@@ 700 square meters ) is said to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area . &quot;
&quot; in IT are the smart heads of our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T chief of Hannes W@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he can imagine how to invest in start @-@ up firms in the New ship@@ yard and later on to limit what to act .
&quot; from the very start , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises some promises : &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ tas@@ tic is only a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million euro have been invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.@@ 3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is regulated by the Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 2@@ 700 @-@ square metres surface in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent give it requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ ist opened second store in the Arctic

&quot; actually , Jut@@ ta wanted to make a dog a big dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 year @-@ old In@@ hab@@ ist of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the tau@@ d market , and after all , she has now reached es@@ wax in the form of a further business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la Shop in front of the business , in which they sold among other bags , suitcase , shoes and gar@@ b of different manufacturers , all is all about women &apos;s hand@@ bags at the Fur@@ la , pur@@ ses are starting from 75 Euro . &quot;
bigger pockets and accessories for up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
this had changed several weeks before .
&quot; but I have worked out for a long time , if I was trying to open a shop , &quot; says broad . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the decision was among other things that also the Fur@@ la producers who are in Bologna at home from the idea of a dedicated location where only their pur@@ se were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the one @-@ in @-@ room in Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who even has Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion &apos;s interest has been widely placed by her mother in the cradle .
&quot; I do most , when something has developed and I can show new trends at high @-@ performance prices . &quot;
why so some woman in seeing a nice hand@@ bag in the tr@@ ance apparatus is also not able to answer the professional house@@ wife with the last certainty .
maybe it is because a beautiful bag has ar@@ ded any out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ aker from K@@ all@@ stadt
&quot; the Pf@@ alz ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from one place , whose inhabitants are named An@@ gi@@ ver . &quot;
this property also has a billi@@ on@@ aire billi@@ on@@ aire the US president wants to become .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always fast @-@ off .
&quot; whether it is advised to xen@@ opho@@ bic , journalists in question or knowledge gaps in the international crisis policy - the applicant could participate in the election campaign . &quot;
and cutting well off .
&quot; this is also registered in the pf@@ alz K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grandparents of the property mil@@ dly desc@@ endant . &quot;
the New Yorker &apos;s family with the family resort is a concept for many in the wine region .
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ site is related over -@@ zig corners with him .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the election campaigns . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del filmed a film about Tr@@ ump .
&quot; and what do the villagers think about his goal , the most powerful man in the world ? &quot;
&quot; I think they find it so exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters way , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native detail of the city has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous spra@@ ys , to which besides Tr@@ ump , the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up @-@ Family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mod@@ esty , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too , so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he did not make it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; although there would be respect for the performance of the family , but also ten@@ denti@@ al the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; is already a little mo@@ ck@@ le , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; noted the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the surrounding area , &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ ked &quot; - too high German : the don@@ ors , says it . &quot;
Tr@@ ump will therefore come from the village of An@@ gi@@ ver .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the later grandfather passed and in the USA a pub for gold dig@@ gers opened . &quot;
foundation of the real estate corporation was the first property purchases in New York .
&quot; the life of the grandparents was not free of tragedy : her desire to return to the home for a long time , led to the Bav@@ arian State , in which the Palat@@ inate was part of that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump because he once was sealed without permission , had the Director of the Institute for pf@@ äl@@ z@@ isches History and Folklore , Roland Paul , explains the film start . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emi@@ grant . &quot;
this is due to the contrasts that are to the sometimes marked statements of the post .
&quot; the damage is repeatedly forced on the Mexican immigrants in the US and called on the construction of a boundary wall , to fri@@ ghten illegal immigrants . &quot;
&quot; as is the pol@@ ym@@ atic , that isn &apos;t as sympathetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relatives ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump &quot; , &quot; Op@@ a was borrowed Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
the winem@@ akers in retirement sees the American more detached with &quot; he is always so temper@@ ed .
does he believe that Tr@@ ump will come ?
&quot; I cannot imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never took care of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ r@@ amm , like man@@ ned K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a neighbor &apos;s family Heinz came to something for the ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ as which was generally good . &quot;
&quot; this is what I cannot imagine of Donald &apos;s , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they would like it better if he didn &apos;t win the choice , for &quot; he has such a radical views , I do not know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had been the Sa@@ gen in the US at the time of his grandfather , they would have been like him , &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ sh@@ to@@ chter , Sarah Dance . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my President is not it , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els Film , for the endor@@ sement of long inter@@ interviewed , have seen 12 000 movie lon@@ ers , even in the US awakening interest . &quot;

&quot; this draw@@ back of the board seemed to play no role for Australian TV spectators , as Sun@@ rise had an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators at the five main cities compared with more than 33@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; today , a slight increase over the ratings on Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number stayed behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3.000 ) . &quot;

the big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words by the former Seri@@ graph of Athens to the Raf@@ t Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama on a recently in@@ wit@@ ched father , who joins with his two children at the New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators . &quot;
critics had wondered if Thom@@ son hit a hit show solo without the Raf@@ t Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening I rep@@ lied with a clear &quot; Yes . &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strongly with 1.9 million spectators and hit the block ( 8@@ 38@@ ,000 ) and T@@ B@@ L ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
Seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17,@@ 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe by the average 44@@ 6,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 am to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening , the first half hour was generated by The Ch@@ ase Australia 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour with 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; the decline in quot@@ as of the second evening at The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident that hot @-@ Se@@ at will eventually win at 17 : 30 pm . &quot;

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret is revealed ? ...
&quot; Lan@@ a Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have gotten unconscious , who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the Bachelor &apos;s , the woman in which Sam Wood died in The Bachelor &apos;s degree , was cloth@@ ed in largest secrecy . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one that has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we were talking with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lan@@ a Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before coming from three two , you may possibly accidentally give a note about who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood keep their lips until the finals on Thursday sealed
&quot; all three women left themselves in ly@@ ric ways , why wood is the perfect man and named his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons for why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; but if the question is asked &quot; &quot; If not you , who should receive the final rose above ? &quot; , &quot; could their answers concerning the kill@@ ings of those who have won the heart of the Bachelor . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki named both quickly - except itself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from day one .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Sam@@ s energies noticed that they were pretty compatible and I thought it was in the whole course of the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands with both feet on earth , it is so much fun to be together with her , &quot; she added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel pleasant and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a pair .
&quot; from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the domestic visit last week made her clear that Wood &quot; One would be . &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I un@@ condition@@ ally put on him now , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked to choose to choose , if not her , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lan@@ a .
&quot; the Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday , 7 : 30 p.m. , on top ten . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the US - and there were many other teams who sent requests to his impressive end of training at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne voted the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a clever decision .
some coach would have run Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank as he lost a sc@@ ram@@ ble so when he did the Aussie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ ti@@ t on Tuesday at the first pun@@ t show on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula made his man and Hay@@ ne gave him the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also in the running play after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of conve@@ ying his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team by the mill , he encouraged them . &quot;
Hay@@ s@@ ula reinforced Hay@@ ne also openly in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by specialist team Co@@ ordinator as Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who ri@@ pped him to forget his missing fishing and care for the next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne patented in a pun@@ t , which was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vi@@ kings . &quot;
it certainly was not the start of the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian poems for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble cur@@ ch@@ end the playing field and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine any ti@@ ghter start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; it was a thing that happens now , you just takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; says Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne missed the Schn@@ itzer with his Ori@@ gin debut then in 2007 when a pass has led to a Tr@@ y for Queensland in his own Go@@ al @-@ Go@@ al section .
overall it was nonetheless a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

&quot; otherwise , we will get con@@ vul@@ sions in the Bav@@ arian education system . &quot;
the daily course of the Free elec@@ torate makes to Friday in the sub@@ terranean Commune .
&quot; actually , very other main themes were planned . &quot;
but the record number of refugees is also dominated by the Free elec@@ torate .
&quot; of course , the subject must lie in &quot; &quot; ca@@ vern &quot; , &quot; said Ju@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ op@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as they were in the wars in the 1960s . &quot;
&quot; so it is not going on , we must go to the cause , &quot; &quot; said Free elec@@ torate . &quot;
&quot; without asylum seekers , the Free elec@@ tors want to push off as fast as possible . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ai@@ wa@@ iter demanded more staff for Administr@@ ations &apos; courts that are responsible for asylum seekers : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum @-@ offs , &quot; said Au@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ W chief critici@@ zed that several federal states were not consistently : &quot; &quot; we bro@@ w nationwide uniform standards of the federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria sho@@ ves off , others not . &quot;
&quot; there we need to become more careful . &quot;
&quot; however , the national policies in meg@@ ali@@ do cannot fall under the table . &quot;
a long @-@ years of ever@@ gre@@ ner stays on the agenda : the policy of education .

but this is not far enough .
&quot; the theme G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; said F@@ W boss . &quot;
we demand freedom of choice for all g@@ ymnasi@@ ums who want this .
&quot; free travel at G@@ 9 , where it is desired . &quot;

&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal , after the police were sha@@ ded in a crowds that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution said a be@@ amer at Wednesday . &quot;

&quot; 20 c@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ ls , known by which it may be used but which is traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal as southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ ages say that new provinces , which are formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the Western Balkans of the ethnic group of the Th@@ ar@@ u who want an independent state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent struggles since the 10 . &quot;
&quot; killed in August , when the four big political parties signed an agreement , divided the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been centrally ruled , for centuries . &quot;
&quot; working on a new constitution has been on the road since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators ha@@ accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;

several An@@ li@@ eger are more concerned - they are concerned for the sale of their advantage
&quot; monthly food was closed behind closed doors , b@@ ted , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday settlement of the Little Sea are near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the interest , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; system @-@ Bau &quot; , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday night in the urban development committee of the Em@@ den Council . &quot;
originally this point was on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
&quot; under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends on the system @-@ construction company entered the offensive : &quot; &quot; we do not respond to all questions an answer , &quot; &quot; he said before the Board members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
yet it &apos;s good to be able to encounter all rum@@ ours now .
the roughly ten to twelve million Euros have been in discussion for months now .
&quot; fierce reactions among sea land@@ owners who were at the meeting , the pictures and new details for the desired hotel building emerged . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , sea owners and board member at the interest representatives of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ained : &quot; that becomes a giant cl@@ ot@@ z that over@@ looks the other blo@@ om . &quot;
&quot; he also fears like several other project critic , that the traffic could be heavily corro@@ bor@@ ated by the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; there have to be complete bus@@ ges , so that things do reck@@ ons , &quot; &quot; said Martin Schulz . &quot;
what exactly is on the gut about a hect@@ are of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator .
&quot; only then must we have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; &quot; said Ralf S@@ hr@@ end . &quot;
&quot; because this was still missing , the development plans are also still variable . &quot;

report by Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; edited by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
for easy overweight diabe@@ tics it can be weight loss surgery .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for mild overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for a new study at least five years .
it &apos;s still too early to tell if easily overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the death information requires a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert on weight loss surgery , which was a editorial board of the new study in J@@ ama . &quot;
weight @-@ loss surgery or obesity surgery use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity has been shown to treat type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out by men who are disease being obes@@ e with a Body measure index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a degree of weight in terms of size , is deemed to be normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
BM@@ I from 25 or more shows that anybody is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
the researchers used the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Information that has accumulated in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity and stomach upset - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those who undergo this operation declined from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained in the ones , who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal around 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who undergo any surgical procedure , accumulated at 36 % the diabe@@ tic disease completely and at 28 % partial . &quot;
&quot; in the medical @-@ treated group , diabetes is fully only rede@@ emed by some percent and in some cases only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were found in controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols &quot; generally better at the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors were found . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitors the patient @-@ blood levels of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
&quot; Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best held under 7 percent , writing the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average ho@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c would have decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
but in the medical therapy group there remained stable at around 8 per cent .
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease the mortality in five years , so that the leading researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also ins@@ ists average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , a higher decline in BM@@ I ( 7,@@ 4 vs. 5.1 percent ) and signed more a complete Over@@ coming from diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of severe men in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was at low @-@ fat people who are subjected to obesity , about 29 per cent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group , called conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for individuals with a BM@@ I below 35 , which are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors are supposed to take weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accum@@ ulate through these genetic changes , that have combined their bodies with obesity and diabetes , revers@@ al is a revers@@ al . &quot;
love @-@ history plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is a topic that tends to be more interesting in the fic@@ tional piece of F@@ ic@@ tion : a young woman , too fre@@ est@@ ly and un@@ si@@ ghtly , lately she hits the flock of her youth , and she fell in love with her . &quot;
&quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; actually , we are not so &quot; of Luisa Bin@@ der . &quot;
&quot; beyond love history , the novel can be especially interesting for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because it plays in Long@@ lers and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the main professional author grew up in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and is pleased that she could set a literary monument to her homeland .
&quot; it &apos;s impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe could not record all refugees , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East could lie . &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist prim@@ ers urged them to end violence in the homeless countries .
&quot; the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the start of his ten @-@ day visit in the United Kingdom , in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies . &quot;
he asked that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed against the interests of each Nations or continents .
he stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admir@@ able but the situation was not fair .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama was praised in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts at dealing with the crisis , he emphas@@ ised that there is only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; concentrating on several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions like a true peace and real development , mainly through education , for which Muslim countries can be created &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we must think about how the kill@@ ings in their countries will be reduced . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of force .
&quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of 11 September and turned out that the US &apos;s violent response has moved a chain of un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able events .
&quot; after the September 11 I have expressed my sympath@@ ies in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives have been good , but he made violence and it has created unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
quadru@@ ple increase of intake of hand san@@ i@@ ti@@ zer by children over the past 4 years
&quot; po@@ is@@ ations centers in the US report about an almost 400 % increase in the number of children under 12 years of age , the strong &amp; alcoholic beverages at Georgia , this is the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the number of revenues from dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants for children under 12 years of age , which report from 3.@@ 26@@ 6 to 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go out in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
he said that some children are able to drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a distur@@ b@@ ance in social media .
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap price .
teenagers are supposed to have a inf@@ ect@@ ant mixed with alcoholic mouth@@ wash to keep a more severe beverage .
younger children can be captured by attractive flavours of the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are sc@@ ented .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berries , grapes and oran@@ ges , which are very appealing to children . &quot;
hand @-@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially with infants can already lead a few sp@@ lash for alcohol poison@@ ing .
&quot; it &apos;s most concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical Director of the Gi@@ fts Centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t get lucky whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and if children come from it , then it is a fast way to consume much alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently taken four sp@@ lash of to straw@@ berry sc@@ f@@ or the hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant at school was brought into an emergency room . &quot;
&quot; their blood @-@ quality was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is considered by a adults by law , said Dr Chris Rit@@ sch@@ ey , an emergency medical doctor who treated her in the G@@ win@@ dy Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ apped their words and was unable to go when she came up in the lap@@ se .
&quot; doctors were monitoring them overnight in a separate children hospital at signs of deer @-@ trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had joined the head , said Rit@@ sch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; it was very wor@@ ris@@ ome , &quot; &quot; Jo@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has parents and teachers recommended to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ acles to be used or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant outside the reach of the child .
over alcohol po@@ is@@ oned out some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
&quot; in 2013 two women died in Ontario , after the lo@@ op@@ sy , the toxic , non @-@ toxic ingredient . &quot;
&quot; employees of healthcare agencies suspect that the product of meth@@ anol has contained a deadly solution , instead of eth@@ anol ) , which was noted as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth class were planned in the state of New York , their &quot; painted &quot; teacher , by passing anti@@ bacterial products all around the classroom , so it was a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ex@@ iles them out of their room .
the police regarded the negotiated plan as &quot; ul@@ li@@ tz &quot; and referred to disciplinary action at the school authorities .

D@@ ons increase leadership about Celtic on five points
&quot; Adam Ro@@ on@@ ey &apos;s co @-@ operation in the first half @-@ time gave Aber@@ deen a narrow victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e , so the D@@ ons score a five @-@ point gap between themselves and Celtic . &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths Play talk about D@@ ish@@ ar@@ mon@@ y
there are rum@@ ors on D@@ ish@@ ar@@ mon@@ ie at Celtic Glasgow that arose spontaneously by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insisted that he and his team @-@ amer@@ ica are not under increased control since they will prepare himself for the confrontation with the Dutch tab@@ ular leader .
&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players look forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish football te@@ dious Netherlands - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former Rang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national players of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in , since there is no title @-@ ri@@ ver@@ ry with the ranks . &quot;
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; &quot; in Holland they show no highlights in the Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the ranking is not there .
people here do not just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
you are talking about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
there &apos;s a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m playing and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn around the things and turn away Dei@@ la .
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic dem@@ a must fight , but the Norwegian Chef s@@ or to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent erup@@ tion from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who are now clearly at the head of the table with five points . &quot;
&quot; dam@@ n said , &quot; Celtic had already had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know , it is very frustrating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel it exactly like that - but we must go on .
&quot; we really need , really the support provided by Celtic because that makes the players better . &quot;
&quot; coming together , is as important . &quot;
War@@ bur@@ ton careful in January @-@ transfers
&quot; despite his comments prior to just a few weeks , the pointed out that he attacks several January @-@ transfers , is Rang@@ ers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton , he ins@@ ists that he will not distur@@ b the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x @-@ squ@@ ad . &quot;
the ex @-@ chief of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; the January @-@ transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
players who come in the summer have these off @-@ season time to integrate with what you saw with our own group in this season .
the team is really good .
&quot; sometimes more damage is done , by adding an unnecessary player to what you really need . &quot;
Celtic @-@ Ziel@@ k Mich@@ u with a back @-@ turn
&quot; S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ storms Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation , has suggested that he could retreat , if his contract is out at S@@ vi@@ ans . &quot;

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while in the UK it altogether increases .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged during the period from May to July in 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom was over 10,000 in the same period decreased by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate was 5 percent higher than 60 per cent , as reported by the offices for National Statisti@@ cs ( ON@@ S ) . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the employment was in Scotland increased by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2.@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
the employment rate for Scotland declined in the course of the quarter to 7@@ 4.@@ 0 percent - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said , &quot; The long @-@ term plan for the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
&quot; it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland met the historic decision , to remain part of the United Kingdom . &quot;
&quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline of unemployment . &quot;

why I will be a Exec@@ ution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , will be seeing how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope that it isn &apos;t going to happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator @-@ gallery during the Death chamber in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ sip is ex@@ orbit@@ ant by the dr@@ au@@ ght . &quot;
he has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation was made for the first time in January above his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; as the day near@@ er back , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a great way to tell the whole story about death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see posts in the US , and as many applications are often available on places , a flaw@@ less lottery takes place to decide which is to be elected . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who is chosen will both be admir@@ able .
I cannot do that .
&quot; apart from Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , I will sit down here by Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with calls and a two and a half hour visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we talk .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen , to draw up what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remind me of all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of being told to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the history of the prisoner , just as he wants , and you get access . &quot;
I describe myself with her .
&quot; she took one that she could have put her better off , &quot; &quot; but she still think that it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ sip had problems with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I had to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it myself if he would do it .
I told him that he may remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter is here to write there .
&quot; if he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the Movement is done against death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of Pod@@ casts that I have made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go here again for all the details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ sip is innocent .
&quot; his actions according to the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ es would make him guilty of being a benefici@@ ary of the act . &quot;
&quot; but I believe that such a strong probability is , that he is not guilty of murder . &quot;
&quot; I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
&quot; I can not claim , really objective . &quot;
there will be other re@@ porters to whom you can apply for that .
what you will get from me is what it means to die for a man to die .

&quot; Moo@@ dy &apos;s also told Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he did find himself under difficult circumstances , when it comes to the positive cob@@ alt tick at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had returned 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ onage allegations , and did not want it to see &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; as too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had to say nothing to say about it and I &apos;ve been eating for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that there is widespread .
&quot; it is sometimes respon@@ ds and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I &apos;ll go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to move about the head , and I would like my owners , that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they begin think , I do not do that , then I should not be a coach . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; before , Moo@@ dy had lifted the bomb into an interview with rac@@ om@@ ing.com that the integrity of integrity had tried to pick its shed . &quot;
&quot; in the eigh@@ teen months , Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with one man - whom I will name , and offered him a work in my stables to deliver information about what I do in my st@@ balls , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a sc@@ amm@@ ers .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly stick to their n@@ oses , because they have failed to believe me , to have failed . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , eh@@ em . Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , current President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , up @-@ to @-@ date CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were now aware of this and today . &quot;
should I think that it is personal ?
did the R@@ V@@ L cra@@ m precise and might blame people outside the coaches for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps people are thinking out there that I am .
&quot; maybe she has to take my license and contra@@ ven@@ e me , and I have no doubt that what I say will be giving her now about it . &quot;
&quot; but I have arrived at that point where it doesn &apos;t care , and that makes me sad . &quot;
this really makes me very sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the training level of the trainer made up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching continued to say that he could throw his license on the table . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy &apos;s best known by its preparation of the un@@ curved master black C@@ avi@@ ar , the R@@ ack treatment rule was &quot; ridiculous &quot; after a packing mud or sound was applied to the horse @-@ debate , what was b@@ umped against the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of race .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has been stra@@ ined mud on the leg .
it could have been that night like that .
for yesterday it could have been like that which was like that .
but it was also like the race day .
Moo@@ dy with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification can be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack at the race . a check into the matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who make up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules but here one went too far , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
man after PO@@ IN@@ Cur@@ sed was arrested

the cycl@@ ist was given with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injury after having been hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley &apos;s motorway .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ Amy is fighting against ri@@ vals because of cont@@ ests
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ una has been referred to as a &quot; Agenda setting &quot; of two Premier League &apos;s favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L program .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee will have the Storm player &quot; Ring@@ eling &quot; with his team allowed during the high season victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
&quot; Bris@@ bane Bron@@ co coach Way@@ ne Ben@@ nett really made a hardly disgu@@ ised note to the Storm Team , after having scored the final victory against North Queensland Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland are not &quot; too good &quot; in R@@ ingen . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ una defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that they are concentrated on their &quot; &quot; close contact &quot; &quot; at the T@@ AC@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ una added that the criticism of two leading trainers at its crew was hope@@ ful , because it feared that they were worried about being struck by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; this emerges over and over again - I did not hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about Ring@@ eling , when she told us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ una on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that in the whole year we have not changed anything from the defensive system or the techniques . however , over the last six weeks we have made our contact with T@@ kl@@ ist to a real focus , and that has produced the turn@@ around . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not able to lose it , so it was a bit a shock for him . &quot;
it &apos;s really funny as this time again and again at this time of year .
&quot; Bell@@ una has attacked the idea of &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Ben@@ nett has won the Prime Minister St George Il@@ tra@@ w@@ ra Dra@@ gons , the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; boring &quot; football match . &quot;
Way@@ ne talks of exciting football .
&quot; he was compared his play on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting her play was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ una . &quot;
&quot; I recall that St. George was being critic@@ ised as a boring team in 2010 , and Way@@ ne said that he will take a shift at it . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team who can play and watch the game as thrilling , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
&quot; this is the ball game , which one wants to play if one has this kind of players . &quot;
&quot; he did this statement in 2010 , he now wants to play football all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so that they can play like this . &quot;
&quot; I have a stronger confidence , because they &apos;re saying these things , because they &apos;re a bit worried , to play against us . &quot;
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think about us when it came to the Big Games .
&quot; Bell@@ una also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result , as the game of Bron@@ co against Cow@@ boys . &quot;
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts at our game , but this is an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks and do not have any points anything cl@@ amping ?
for me it is the Game maps .
&quot; when they mention , it means that in a phase we will meet again . &quot;
&quot; the Storm team has free this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Queensland Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I park . ticket sales begin from next service tomorrow . &quot;
Ser@@ bi@@ er with 200,000 $ deposit for drug ill@@ age
&quot; a man who may possibly cause a life @-@ long sentence due to his temp@@ tations to come into the ownership of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , who have been shaken after Queensland , was released against a b@@ ail of 200,000 $ . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Bundes@@ pol@@ ye@@ ei was found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was watched as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina and later at Café Co@@ om@@ era Rec@@ house where the police took 40 kilograms of the drug in a Chinese Echo .
&quot; despite a potentially viable punishment for trying to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the advocates of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole amount and that in the cafe could have been of an inno@@ cu@@ ous reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Re@@ agan , was worried about the escape of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic . &quot;
he has a clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travelled to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with the pen@@ alties , he assumed the police about its place of residence . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s mother and step@@ father had a security deposit of 200,000 dollars to be offered to release his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ id@@ av@@ able explanations of the two persons it is clear that the circulation of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Pas@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from being , waiting . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions he sends his Australian and his Serbian passport , where the police were daily and at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;

&quot; during a rear agreement with three trucks on the highway 5 in Karlsruhe , a truck driver has been severely injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;

St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girl used to cur@@ ling ped@@ ophi@@ le to send images
&quot; a ped@@ ophil@@ es used the phone of an 11 year old girl , to request pictures of child abuse . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg was wearing the girl &apos;s phone when this was asleep , log@@ out into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of permanent images sent from children that were sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hands of staying asleep Ho@@ gg .
&quot; she saw it , and found the confusing reports and aler@@ ted immediately her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of it and looked at the five images , then analysed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; web research that used terms for the search for an im@@ permanent images of children . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed against the officers that he did it , as there was &quot; &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet &quot; and he then announced that a poli@@ cem@@ an would be to fri@@ ghten it . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer E@@ ili@@ dh Rober@@ t@@ son said to the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court , &quot; he said it would be an addiction that it is addic@@ tive to people . &quot;
&quot; he concluded that seeking on the computer were carried out by him , but said it had happened because he wanted to claim a poli@@ cem@@ an to sc@@ are a ped@@ ophi@@ le . &quot;
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked to send more photos .
he said he did so to enti@@ ce it .
&quot; he said he is sick in the head , when he has drink , and he said , he wants to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ t@@ son added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on the tre@@ mb@@ ling , and on crying . &quot;
so she saw the in@@ decent pictures on the telephone and confron@@ ting the def@@ endants .
&quot; the girl was interviewed and said , that the accused will take advantage of the accused computers and Play@@ station to talk with girls who saw much younger than he did . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , ple@@ aded not guilty to the charges against the E@@ states on January 25 of this year , and not to be at a hearing at a hearing held on 24 March this year . &quot;
&quot; defen@@ ders Gregor S@@ im requested that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the Register of sexual offen@@ ders , since one could argue that &quot; no real sexual element is to be found in his understanding . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Al@@ ist@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael squ@@ al@@ lied with the judgment of October to October in order to obtain background reports on social work .
&quot; Ho@@ gg was allocated in this case , but due to hear@@ ings at other still available cases in pre @-@ trial custody . &quot;
it was recorded before the date of urine in the Register of the sexual pen@@ al code .
smug@@ glers soft on small border crossing to Germany from
more and more refugees are taken off from the major points of action at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many tro@@ users were made of fear of discovery and arrest of people more often at smaller bor@@ der@@ ings
&quot; on the Austrian side out , said a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police . &quot;
&quot; along the river flow Inn , more than 1,000 refugees were picked up in the districts of Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn . &quot;
they were on foot across bridges and dust on the German side .
they will be captured by Federal Police and forwar@@ ded to the registration .
&quot; on the Munich main station , following the new police station met a lot more refugees before the end of the weekend on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; just until 8@@ am , there are around 700 people arrived in the state capital , said a narr@@ ator in the morning . &quot;

Stuttgart : prec@@ ursor of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the South@@ west
Meteor@@ ologists warn of tor@@ ches in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; because of a deep pressure on Western Europe , the current maritime service currently take warm sea air to the country , distributed the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; brave Deep would be the sp@@ urs of the tro@@ op of &quot; Henry &quot; , &quot; who has drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the past few days . &quot;
fierce storms and t@@ witter are expected mainly in swimming .
&quot; according to DW@@ D until Thursday , it is still in the Black Forest , on the spon@@ ging Al@@ b and to figure at the bottom @-@ sea level with em@@ ads of 60 to 90 km per ho@@ arding . &quot;
the sun was soon to be seen by the sun on Friday .
the mass does it : every two years the car@@ makers show up their novel@@ ties at the I@@ AA .
&quot; in 2015 , it is especially noticeable in compact cars that are currently especially well @-@ selling . &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently especially popular : around 28,@@ 1 per cent of the new registr@@ ations has been in@@ scri@@ bed on this segment only in August .
this is also reflected on the I@@ AA ( public stage 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic ten@@ sion@@ istic cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars will be presented a lot of new compact models this year .
one of the largest Premi@@ ers for German auto industry is the Opel A@@ stra , which will be on dealers in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ stra is an extremely important model , &quot; said Opel &apos;s CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be well sold , the new A@@ stra boom should not be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel is facing an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf , in the prospect of 5@@ 650 Euro . &quot;
the current A@@ stra costs EUR 16 9@@ 90 .
the A@@ stra has a new 1,4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 horse@@ power .
&quot; H@@ esse includes additional diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 b@@ hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder petrol engine . &quot;
unlike the main competitor VW Golf and Ford Focus there is the Opel A@@ stra first only as a fifth .
&quot; the second one will follow in the spring of the Kom@@ bi , who is already visible on the I@@ AA . &quot;
and what will cross the A@@ stra exit at the I@@ AA remaining to new comp@@ actor ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault Shi@@ pped the fourth generation of its A@@ stra competitor Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the fair the Mé@@ gan@@ e is working exclusively as a fifth in a conventional and acc@@ entu@@ ated sporting GT @-@ version .
&quot; in the trade he comes back in the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ A3 wants to find its new model in the strongly growing segment .
&quot; in doing so , the compact Infin@@ iti is fitted with its curved lines fully into the design line of the brand . &quot;
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but also diesel with 80 kW / 109 HP or 125 kW / 170 HP is also available in the offer .
&quot; Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1,@@ 0 @-@ liter turbine and an output of 82 kW / 111 PS . &quot;
the maximum torque is due to characters of 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
the sales start of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; Ds 4 : not brand new , but completely renewed is the compact S@@ DS 4 that is seen on the I@@ AA . &quot;
&quot; on the outside , the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers laid hands on the front at the front : the cooler star was drawn new and the changed head@@ lights with LED technology was drawn . &quot;
&quot; inside , in particular , the Inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment@@ system was moderni@@ zed , which reduced the number of buttons by a touch@@ screen and first integrated by Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play . &quot;

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres in cells are deserted
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has quite given an ex @-@ prisoner of the whole pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , who has spent months in a small cell . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation , when they are housed in small cells . &quot;
this has decided the Federal Constitutional Court on a vote on Wednesday .
the affected people can even hope to judge the judges even if only a few days were locked in to tight spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
&quot; with it , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was located in the Berlin prison @-@ Te@@ gel @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was therefore completely separate . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man who is in his lawyer &apos;s details were now back on the free foot to have moved to a bigger cell . &quot;
his office cl@@ auses on account of the un@@ worthy arrest of migrants against the country of Berlin were sh@@ attered .
&quot; however , the Constitutional Court raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber &apos;s Constitutional Court and rejected the case for a new trial . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
the Chamber of Commerce now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons only a few days of Haf@@ tt@@ age , only a few days later , the compensation would be decisive , such a compensation would be made . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; the lack of protection of the personality would be to be concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce must now clarify the amount of artic@@ ulations .
the constitutional inver@@ ters have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
&quot; they said only in April of an in@@ mate , because he was naked in a cell . &quot;
man un@@ worthy is said to be a decision between 2011 and the multi @-@ domain fle@@ ction of a cell without separate toilet .
&quot; Karlsruhe on Wednesday reached the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had an in@@ mate in a parallel operation in November 2009 . &quot;
&quot; the then compl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs has been taken daily from 15 to 21 hours a day , in such a similar cell , in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot;
the Berlin prisons were also over in recent weeks for the lack of personnel in the Head@@ lines .
&quot; prisoners are therefore always including 23 hours including the aggres@@ siveness , even to blows , it should have come about because of the tense situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the legal pr@@ ero@@ g@@ ative , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied for young athletes , 19 May 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating the &quot;
immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the chan@@ cell@@ or is determined to accept it .
what is coming to Germany ?
&quot; approximately 800 000 asylum seekers are coming to Germany by forecasts of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs this year , according to the statement of vice chan@@ cell@@ or Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I will again and again : we can create this and we create that . &quot;
what comes to Germany conve@@ ys the following overview .
&quot; as for different forecasts up between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Education ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institute ) dwell@@ ings every year - and the next five years . &quot;
that &apos;s almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; the shortage of housing , but especially for payable flats : yearly , 60@@ ,000 and 80@@ ,000 social housing estates fell out of the rental price and in order to apply these particularly favourable apartments for refugees . &quot;
&quot; Federal Minister for Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) , therefore wants to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; a lot too little is that from the perspective of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 thousand social housing had to come up annually , and for this , the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.@@ 4 billion per year . &quot;
&quot; agreed , scientists and federal ministries are in fact that there have to be more tax benefits for investment in residential construction . &quot;
&quot; according to the Institute for Employment Research ( Institute for Employment Research ) , 55 percent of the refugees fle@@ ed in Germany can increase . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees would not be asked systematically at all after their qualifications in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for Integration and Education at the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
but for the integration of refugees it is essential whether you find a job in Germany .
&quot; work is the key for social contacts , for the appreciation in the reception society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the im@@ migrant , tells migrant who Diet@@ rich Thr@@ u@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ u@@ hardt , there has been a political shift : from job fuels for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; while there was a job opening for asylum seekers between up to five years ago , this was reduced in November 2014 on three months , as well as the resi@@ dency period , which asylum seekers have limited to a residence . &quot;
&quot; in the society - even on the basis of skilled workers - they have prevailed in the view that refugees should be able to make access to the labour market faster , even more quickly . &quot;
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are lack of German knowledge .
&quot; up to now , there is still no specific offer of general and work @-@ related language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs are most often given by personal contacts .
the structure of networks is therefore based on Thr@@ u@@ ated by the Royal Road for work integration .
&quot; the Berlin school administration established that only a few refugees give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to fifteen percent : &quot; for the kidn@@ apping parents it is only once again important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ no@@ bar , spokes@@ person for youth and family at the Berlin Senate . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration of hand@@ outs distributed in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators should increase greatly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity capacities - e.g. by allowing more vocational schools . &quot;
in the countries students are prepared without a course of welcome in welcome classes .
&quot; however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also of teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage , says Be@@ ate St@@ ote from the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk is estimated that approximately 20 percent of the refugees are studying in Germany .
&quot; generally , no federal state under asylum seekers or commem@@ oration of the study - the only exception being has been Berlin , domestic Frank Hen@@ kel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his attitude . &quot;
&quot; study @-@ willing refugees could be facilitated by access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; for refugees with a dom@@ inion , or d@@ ul@@ ing receive no benefits under the asylum seekers Act , when they begin studying . &quot;
&quot; basically , the latter is not getting up to a BA@@ Fö@@ G , since it does not fall under the circle of the local people . &quot;
&quot; toler@@ ated refugees had to be lived for four years in Germany to be entitled to BA@@ Fö@@ G legitimate , from 1st January 2016 to shortened this Spanish range to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but these mort@@ ars must be closed but require Steff@@ en Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
&quot; in future , Islam will play a more important role in the future because many refugees are Muslims and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually ero@@ ded equal rights to Islam , as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ church right to develop into a new state of religion . &quot;
&quot; it would also be important for the establishment of an Islamic welfare association , which is professionally seeking new arrivals . &quot;
the rights are also obligations .
&quot; so , the representatives of Islam have to agree on a clear contact and be prepared to work together with the state in many sectors and to give him certain possibilities of control . &quot;
&quot; that includes a readiness to act against religious fundament@@ alism , as well . &quot;
&quot; the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maced@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts could also be entered in Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to au@@ ti@@ ghten these conflicts in Germany do immediately have their right to stay here in Germany , in Germany , &quot; &quot; he told in Bay@@ rische Rund@@ funk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will continue to be a major theme of society in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this will also have to change the majority society , the dismantling of discrimination and racism will also displ@@ ac@@ ement . &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - a anti @-@ discrimination position since a tight decade and a universal equality law .
&quot; but it is getting very slow , how the NS@@ U series , in which police and government ignored the rac@@ ist motif . &quot;
&quot; equal chances for all : what migration organizations and stakeholders , non @-@ white German already demand for a long time , and what international agreements like the anti @-@ racial anti@@ ster Germany must undertake , must be peaceful in the coming years if the country is peace@@ fully and its new citizens should use its possibilities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is capable of supporting the previously expected refugees , the German President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , German Federal President Victor Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for man@@ power and capacities , we create that , &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , it takes extra money to flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , all arrivals are equal to the registration of health types . &quot;
acquired services could later be cancelled later with the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; and in the long run it is highly questionable , so many people are surve@@ yed with the limited power of power that asylum seekers can be viewed . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , make doctors especially create the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; so far , the scientists of the Berlin scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are worse above their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in medical practices , the interpre@@ ter would have to be taken care of , she calls for them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be helped many refugees , but also with more gener@@ alized medical contact points at the emergency area . &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
under refugee camps approximately there are clearly more unbe@@ arable people and in the young people go about HIV @-@ education .
&quot; but with the partly other disease @-@ cases , German doctors would come from her training but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery says . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not so hard to recognize . &quot; and what affects the sleeve &apos;s angel , be even allevi@@ ating through the refugees and even reli@@ eving sight . &quot;
&quot; Syrians have developed a sophisticated educational system , several refugees and even doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to demonstrate their qualifications and would possibly show examinations again . &quot;
at least half of the refugees coming to Germany is sick ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) mentally ill : most of them suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress @-@ compul@@ sive disorder or mental depression .
&quot; viol@@ in@@ ely , be refugee @-@ in@@ der , explains Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study published by TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee sk@@ ind traumati@@ zed in Germany
&quot; suffering from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress is suffering from , among others , suffers of so @-@ called Flas@@ h@@ backs with breathing difficulty , di@@ zz@@ iness , cardiovascular and death . &quot;
further symptoms are sleeping and concentration disorders , strong shock waves and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent that the symptoms would be chronic , be an early treatment necessary , stated Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; however , only four percent of psych@@ ologically sufferers have yet received a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although , psych@@ ologically @-@ seeking asylum seekers can be an application for psych@@ otherapy treatments , but the processing usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; moreover , among the social offices mostly experts or doctors , who are not trained for the mental disorders , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites to dream
&quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; the Cir@@ cus Experience takes place in the traditions of Cir@@ cus art . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to attract any age group in the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst looks into the man@@ ege on the tiles in was@@ en for day@@ dreams .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine to live without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , animal @-@ , and junior @-@ free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - under this slogan is the current man@@ e@@ way presentation . &quot;
for over 33 years the cir@@ cus is in the hands of the family Pro@@ bst .
the gift of inspiration for the family is in the blood .
&quot; it is important for us to take away the people from their everyday routine and bring it in a completely different world for two hours , &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior staff . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ dorf with a world city flair , &quot; said Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst its concept . &quot;
&quot; however , 50 cities on the island of just 3 000 km long tour can experience this flair . &quot;
the program of Cir@@ cus is convinced with talented artists from around the world .
&quot; excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v Clo@@ wn draws the audience with wit and charm . &quot;
even the Castillo Brothers understand their craft .
the hero of the St@@ um@@ m@@ lin wants to loose the Cub@@ an duo .
ease and light@@ ness - with these words they identify themselves .
your hum@@ orous art on the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s her@@ zen in the storm .
apart from numerous lau@@ ghing excit@@ ers the ac@@ rob@@ atic of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst looks also with finger@@ tips and joint .
to balance with the wheel on a ball ?
there is no problem for He y@@ uan .
Ser@@ ony will fascin@@ ate and sc@@ are at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascinated with their flexibility .
60 employees from 12 nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stresses Stephan@@ ies mother , Brig@@ itte , &quot;
abnorm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ ams are only too often subject to animal protection organisations .
&quot; Stephanie Pro@@ bst takes a position here as well : &quot; &quot; does not our animals know well , we are not doing well . &quot;
some 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every string unit .
&quot; the &quot; four @-@ legged arti@@ ste &quot; , &quot; as they are lovingly called , will be read by the eyes every wish . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
the animal does not feel comfortable it does not want it into the ring .
the supreme commandment thus : good for the animals ensure .
&quot; specially on their z@@ eb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mix of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a z@@ eb@@ ra @-@ mare , the family is very relaxing . &quot;
the two animals have lived together in a en@@ closure for eight years and nothing has happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our small jum@@ bo there , &quot; &quot; adds Brig@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the z@@ eb@@ roid is still not ready for the ring , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; so for each visitor , something might be part of it . &quot;
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter whether it &apos;s five or 1 200 viewers , we always do our best and with all my heart . &quot;
the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites from 17 to 20 September at 17 and 20 o &apos;clock .
Sunday morning the program begins at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
&quot; Thursday is the family day , at 17 o &apos;clock the prices at 17 o &apos;clock the rates are reduced . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the animal welfare is open every day from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe keeps in the parliament wrong speech
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down from one podium in the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he continued un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the parliament was also committed by allegations of opposition to the opposition , that they received anonymous death threats and had warned them of accompanying the Mr Mu@@ gabe to Mr Mu@@ gabe and Bu@@ hr@@ ands . &quot;
&quot; last month , they had booked him and interrupted him during his speech the position of the nation in parliament - this is the talk he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
the Spe@@ aker of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Op@@ positions politicians have received SMS messages on their cell phone that they warned Mr. Mu@@ gabe .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but she has the title &apos; death &apos; , he told journalists after the speech . &quot;
&quot; it warns the Parliament &apos;s members that immunity are passed in parliament , and as soon as they leave the parliament , parliamentary immunity are no longer effective . &quot;
the leader said that the Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i @-@ led party was &quot; concerned about the dangers for the politicians .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will have up to 30.000 jobs
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30.000 jobs within the restructuring and installation efforts of the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; HP will then print out in two listed companies this year , and will separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing business @-@ hardware and service activities . &quot;
the anticipated loss of job results in a load of more than $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter .
&quot; this restructuring programme will allow a competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ chairman and Chief Executive , which shall lead unity after separation . &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise is getting smaller and stronger than it is HP today , and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
&quot; as a stand@@ alone enterprise , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has over 50 billion Swiss revenue and will be limited to providing so far built @-@ in technology solutions for companies , such as an explanation of the company . &quot;
&quot; spl@@ its a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill He@@ w@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard , to produce electrical installations and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage has called &quot; the birthplace of the Silicon Valley . &quot; &quot;
HP has a massive restructuring process to cope with the recur@@ rence of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in that area based on the conviction that closely focused companies achieve better performance . &quot;
arsen@@ al @-@ captain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates are standing in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it was only September and if his rehabilitation runs according to plan , there is no reason why he could not play before Christmas . &quot;
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history his involvement in the next summer is certainly uncertain .
&quot; the great shame on this actual issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had stopped the last season after a separate kno@@ ck@@ le br@@ ink , and then re@@ discovered to his old momentum during the pres@@ e@@ ason . &quot;
&quot; this kind of hurt does not threaten the career , &quot; said Mr. Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that did not swim well .
it is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it didn &apos;t work in conjunction with his buttons or with the injury he had before .
&quot; this may seem true from purely medical perspective , but as worth@@ less recognized , there are the per@@ tin@@ ent danger of more injury , always when a player attempts to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops a pleas@@ urable pattern .
Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd had 23 different illnesses of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut in six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of arsen@@ als and 157 Lig@@ asp@@ ton in the last five seasons .
&quot; the wider image for arsen@@ al is that , in six of eight games , since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League clubs were leading the most viol@@ ability stage . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ess accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the infringement rate during the last season will last . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a random period of time in which you have to strengthen your body and gain mixed feelings &quot; , &quot; said Mr. Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will pass a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
Arsenal begins his Champions League season on Wednesday evening at Din@@ amo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ weg for next Wednesday and Wen@@ ger introduces himself a rotation within the team .
&quot; Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Post@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and to the players who need it to get a small break @-@ up , &quot; &quot; said . &quot;
&quot; although Arsenal won clear favor@@ ites , coming through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the places with the greatest intimi@@ dation effect in Europe . &quot;
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; un@@ conqu@@ erable &quot; campaign started in the last season .
the stadium completed on Tuesday night by a earthquake where on the Richter scale 3@@ 3.2 were measured .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is of the opinion that Arsenal won the teaching from last season with the Champions League &apos;s capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains of the distant hope that he will lead the club to his first European ap@@ ok@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said L@@ ater . &quot;
it has never folded in the arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not a dre@@ amer . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the Com@@ edy show that gave us serious lessons of men &apos;s friendly
&quot; the lack of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open themselves , now even more desper@@ ate than ever has become , such as self @-@ dr@@ ate amongst young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high proof . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains common in men than women . &quot;
in attempts to tackle the problem announced the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ase ( CAL@@ M - Camp@@ a@@ ign against a miserable life ) 2015 as the year of the man to ask the culture to ask for help if they need it .
friendship is the center@@ piece in the fight for master@@ ing this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depressed symptoms reported that if the suff@@ erer had a enough high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood &quot; , its chances of recovery are double . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not depressed , a circle of mental healthy friends suffer the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course , you have to get some friends so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of social media , communication , with its emphasis on style above substance , the in@@ ability of the answer is often more important than a significant contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life has the need to appear strong , wholesome and successful , even if in reality the isolation dominates . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists are ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , everything at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that affect our spiritual health much deeper . &quot;
and how a video game @-@ inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire has recently declared money can really not buy .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was put on your head .
&quot; every character was not defined by his work , but determined by his personality , which shines through the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s hu@@ gs , moments in football stadium and the longing of Ros@@ s to Rachel - all that came out of knowing that men can definitely relate to , even though they often go back to fully explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; like an employee of the phone care , I explained : ... &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel depressed and confident , can really clearly show me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not able to talk with friends .
&quot; I get the old phrase &quot; I get along with it &quot; has an enormous effect , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one speaks about problems openly . &quot;
&quot; friends is one of the shows that will come to mind , when I try to offer long @-@ term gains . &quot;
it also presents clearly the small moments of men @-@ friendly people .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ sider &apos;s status over the telephone calls the people in moments of despair , also helping the long @-@ term support come from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , when you celebrate Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ feast day with the celebration of the day completely new scenery , why don &apos;t you take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better , when you see somebody alone in Star@@ bucks , give him a smile and tell you Hello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the entire 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
&quot; Maria meets to help P@@ SG , Malmö to cervi@@ cal &quot;
Angel Santa Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson &apos;s Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malmö .
&quot; Maria met at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps to bring P@@ SG , in Malmö . &quot;
here is the report and the reaction to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Ed@@ Park@@ inson &apos;s course held course as Paris Saint @-@ Germain @-@ won the Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prince &apos;s Vic@@ stadium on Tuesday started .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after starting his Champions League Deb@@ ut as P@@ SG @-@ players who brought the French master to the path , but afterwards , they passed a series of opportunities before they finally pushed their lead , when Cav@@ ani achieved a super@@ visor in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in Group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish Masters , as they are not only striving for the qualification rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarters in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a c@@ ass@@ sp@@ ade of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an Mach@@ d@@ mo@@ vic@@ s gave pas@@ siv@@ ated chance to the gate . he later started in the game against his hometown team and against the association with which he has started his illustr@@ ative career already in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to get at home or to win in the Champions League . thus , it &apos;s a good start to re @-@ create problems and look back , even when there are certain things we have to perf@@ ected in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; told us . &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we have not scored one or two further goals . &quot;
&quot; he hi@@ mo@@ vic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which was able to hold a 2 : 2 draw in his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was aired in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; Argent@@ inian fully @-@ swal@@ lowed so was known as the man who ran for P@@ SG to the next stage in Europe , when he ran in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malmö &apos;s defense before he finished in Johan Wil@@ de past beautiful in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone believed that P@@ SG was able to achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malmö , that Celtic in a play @-@ off suggested to reach this level , stood at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine no@@ amm@@ ers on the field and ended with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle ground up a severe enemy . &quot;
&quot; but except for a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed away to Kevin Tr@@ p P@@ ill@@ ar in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , P@@ SG had sometimes in response to some mis@@ eries and bad deals , not least by any case of any mis@@ carriage and was abandoned at no less than five attempts alone in the first half , after the restart of Cav@@ ani took him after the restart . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he pointed out much more skill , when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass of Mach@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , the Di Maria turned into a m@@ ural , which was given by Wil@@ de in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pl@@ ump ... &quot;
&quot; the second goal was finally right after the hours of the stamp , thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Uruguay tor thereby generated his 6th Se@@ ason Pass , after Mach@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had set a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; this ended all the thoughts that Malmö could come back to the game , and only an excellent entry of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could be lifted to the end result , before being in Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later issued that P@@ SG played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish league which did not have the same level . &quot;
the qualification plays are not sufficient .
hats off before Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film photography
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the Afgh@@ an American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the variety and said that she is not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a Sunday night of HB@@ OS &apos;s Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , who emphas@@ ised the need for alternative approaches , especially in terms of a black protagon@@ ists in the chosen screen@@ play of the project . &quot;
&quot; when we talk about diversity , then do it in the cast of the film and not in the cast of the show &quot; , &quot; insured Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted , with irrelevant un@@ belief and called &quot; hoo ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian himself . &quot;
on and Brown the producer singing Ben Mon@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ my@@ ly brothers to discuss the show @-@ fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would like to invite people to think about it - who will be always the director with the director of Harmony , &quot; &quot; said Brown at first . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and it is a sp@@ line which is defeated by her white pot . &quot;

&quot; after the discussion has been broad@@ cast@@ ed , the Social Media attracted media from dis@@ approval via Dam@@ ons comments . &quot;
&quot; by Mr Po@@ oni , Mr Po@@ oni expresses his anger at the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on on the only black person in the room , so he can explain their variety - this is SO MU@@ EL@@ T that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et has served as 5.000 res@@ ets and 4,000 le@@ kes since its publication . &quot;
Dam@@ ons comments come at a time when accurate renewable representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
&quot; after the teenage Michael Brown killed in 2014 by a white c@@ emen , the movement of Black lives Mat@@ ter achieved a nationwide effect and put forward by authorities and authorities , discrimin@@ atory practices against colour defen@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince was doing a recording for the movement during the introduction of the nom@@ inees &apos;s albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; album silent &quot; , &quot; ( albums are still their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums are still their importance . &quot;
&quot; more recently , leader of the movement of Black lives Mat@@ ter published an explanation as a response to the question of the Fox @-@ News @-@ Person of Elisabeth H@@ b@@ beck , whether the group should be seen as a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black lives Mat@@ ter is a &quot; &quot; love @-@ group &quot; , &quot; the leaders said . &quot;
&quot; recently announced that Dam@@ on was placed on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ees , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le , who will be invited to visit the Pope to discuss about the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
&quot; whether he adopted the invitation or had already met the Pope , it is clear . &quot;
&apos; American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; cryp@@ t First Champion
&quot; professional sports clim@@ bers , and operator recep@@ tor Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero , became the first athle@@ te which won the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; the competition show , which just graduated in 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant , who closed all steps of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the final . &quot;
&quot; to the last task , the climbing was part of a 75 feet long climb @-@ rope in 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the period with which he completed the first Ath@@ en@@ as , who finished the ti@@ ent Phase 4 from American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge full three seconds more quickly , which made him winner . &quot;
Cal@@ di@@ ero talked to E ! messages after the hard @-@ fought victory - still under shock on winning the Great Prize of 1 million dollars .
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than 10,000 $ or my life , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap money . &quot;
so all of a sudden .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the executive producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood re@@ porter to discuss the finals and why Brit@@ ten , although he was the first ever finished the course , does not get any prize money . &quot;
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it receives one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changed - it receives the great gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t believe that he will win something over that .
he is just so happy to have what he did .
for all distinc@@ tions he was received by fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by somebody , then I am happy that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac had felt just the same when they had exchanged the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season to begin shooting in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sli@@ ces at Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ W@@ OL@@ IS@@ --@@ the second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit tiger .
&quot; once before , they were once one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tiger &apos;s on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers are reduced to her role as a sp@@ iler , but they played this part perfectly for the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ wins squ@@ ander@@ ed a chance for Ascension within a half of Houston , for the second American League of Wild@@ card . &quot;
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ Word , which was so difficult to seize over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad B@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon was holding his early offensive support ; when Detroit completed three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed 6 times in 1 / 3 sessions and made it possible for three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strong , &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to throw at bull@@ pen every game , and therefore I plan to move into the game . &quot;
the designed tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three matches and was in two uns with his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August .
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit game in Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits on July 6th . &quot;
&quot; he has kept the pl@@ y@@ wood well , &quot; &quot; told Pri@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at his ( impact training ) , looked clearly better at bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight to the game . &quot;
with three R@@ uns in the rear meeting at the end of the seventh meeting the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back into play .
center Fiel@@ ds B@@ yron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; Right Fiel@@ ds Aaron Hi@@ cks achieved a cabinet , and Simon brought his second bases for Brian Do@@ cian for Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed bla@@ ins Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy over@@ ran a wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , before the nomin@@ ee R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who escaped the right @-@ handed spin @-@ ha@@ ge a Two @-@ Run . &quot;
with a pair of runners and the finish run during the second run Ver@@ ges the third b@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ps to a double Play .
was it in the major league for the 27th time this season did pl@@ ou@@ ps hit a double play
&quot; after Detroit offered an Insurance Run at the end of the ninth ward , the Wall brought a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the result of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
the right @-@ handed sco@@ oter however S@@ ano with three pit@@ ches for its fifth Save .
Detroit benefited to the pr@@ el@@ ude to the game from a not moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers made three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the legal @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been rep@@ ain@@ ted before the match from the viol@@ in@@ ist , after having been missing for over one month because of a back pain . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I have liked , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I stopped , and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches since in the third inning . &quot;
after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter we sent a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a &apos; Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z delivered Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game that managed a single &apos; up the middle &apos; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z finished his 0 @-@ 21 story series with the down@@ folders in the Scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third b@@ ner Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right hand side , managed a further run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach third , which ended the threat . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers laid on the second scored one @-@ out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ ds Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; &quot; T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor said . &quot;
&quot; he has not done very well , but he did get the right spot . &quot;
Hu@@ gh@@ es found himself in a Pit@@ ch @-@ Count re@@ generated no points in the third inning before being replaced by the Rel@@ ie@@ ver @-@ handed ators A.@@ J.@@ A@@ ser .
Hu@@ gh@@ es came to three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .

his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people in this shelter will then be accommodated in Wiesbaden ( Wiesbaden , like the town of Wiesbaden on the Tuesday evening . &quot;
it will reck@@ on with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .

Isch@@ l : German military measures in Syria an option
&quot; head of Munich &apos;s Security conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , provides military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe that resol@@ ute thinking about military action options should not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he drafted the European states &quot; collective . &quot;
four years ago one was glad that the cup of a military involvement in Germany has passed .
&quot; now the conflict is approaching front of our front door , &quot; &quot; he said in Germany . &quot;
&quot; also , the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international aid to refugees . &quot;
Austria controls the Southern and eastern borders
&quot; according to Germany , Austria has also introduced security to its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , the Austrian Minister of Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in Austrian television station OR@@ F , to Hungary , no one now . &quot;
&quot; even Germany has no refugees back to Austria , too . &quot;
&quot; no , that is so agreed , &quot; she stated . &quot;
&quot; to the question of an agreement which could include a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , I &apos;ve already given appropriate discussions between the Direc@@ torate General for Public Security and representatives of Germany . &quot;
concrete figures called them not and pointed out to discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
in the last days ten@@ tens of thousands of refugees had come from the so @-@ called Bal@@ can@@ route from Hungary to Austria .

Germany started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states have so far failed to agree on a common approach to the crisis .
&quot; the EU &apos;s interior ministers want to take on a new attempt at a new startup for binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees on the coming Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot;
&quot; given the strong refugee crisis in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries with the first @-@ time and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will hold this together with the countries , and announced Merkel in the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultation with the Prime Minister in the chan@@ cell@@ or in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; defend Merkel , those people who bro@@ w the protection , came this too . &quot;
but who does not have a lead @-@ perspective but could not stay in Germany too .
this idea had been he@@ eded in the lap .
&quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or emphas@@ ised , the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge effort of force . &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees have now stuck on the Baltic Sea route .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
&quot; a few hours later , the government announced that the border to Romania was also back with a fence . &quot;
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
&quot; Hungary wants to prevent the smug@@ glers hung over Romania , &quot; said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to to the planned new border fence . &quot;
the Romanian government condemned the Plan immediately .
there were first sti@@ cking of people who had crossed the fence .

Rome now has a Martin Luther square
shortly 500 years after the Reformation in Rome there is now a Martin Luther Square .
&quot; in the presence of town President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , on Wednesday a hitherto unknown position in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill , had been bapti@@ sed in the name of the German Reform@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park lies in the middle of Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ seum .
the naming was requested by the working group of the evangel@@ ical Ch@@ urches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded the fact that the Protest@@ ants in the City of the Pop@@ es were able to live for centuries as a minority often only in secret to their faith . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic way , the Tradition of the Christian faith in Rome become more welcome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) stayed as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the year @-@ on 15@@ 10 / 11 several months in Rome .
he emp@@ t the city at that time as a welcome sin @-@ feeling .
his negative impressions are likely to follow him in his future fight against Rome .
&quot; the Luther had , then , with his thes@@ es , against the Ab@@ las@@ sh@@ an@@ del , had begun the split of the Dutch church . &quot;
hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( Con@@ gol@@ ding ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main monuments who founded Ot@@ mar Old for its Bible .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post has written the introduction and updated Scripture .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which now appeared with gorgeous images . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar &quot; , &quot; which was formulated in 150 motives by his very personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
its &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has obtained the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
&quot; on the contrary , according to the respective topics , this can be quite dark . &quot;
&quot; approximately three years Ot@@ mar Old has worked on his bi@@ ble project , for which he has met a subjective artistic selection from the many themes of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these include cycles , which are themes such as cru@@ st@@ g , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or father@@ land . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it has always been fascinated with several partners : this applies to the Luther publisher with his the@@ ological outlook , as well as the Kettler company with his emphasis on art books . &quot;
and that is above all the author of Klaus Al@@ te@@ post who has dis@@ gr@@ asp@@ ed himself on the basis of painting with the Bible study .
&quot; it has interpreted the Bible by the &quot; Ot@@ mar &quot; &quot; selected Bible and is today in the present context , &quot; translated into the current inter@@ relations . &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ ally mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; nestled among the original Bible College of Martin Luther , and any part of the artist , who is depicted in his own personal thoughts about the situation . &quot;
the tin @-@ band has golden Let@@ ters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allowed a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of intimacy .
&quot; emotions were finally a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar , which was born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Sover@@ eign Order . &quot;
&quot; therefore the education came already with the pipe stock , &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Old . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to re @-@ work that , in order to be able to carry my father down again , too . &quot;
&quot; his second goal is to make art more important in the quick@@ est time : &quot; &quot; the perception of picture @-@ worlds is characterised by complaints , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism will cause there .
artists have a different lust and desire to point things .
images have always something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a dinosau@@ r .
&quot; Ot@@ mar Old wants to understand that the spect@@ ator lifted himself into the pictures , &quot; let them come up , discover and feel the power they have , &quot; the image is seeking his counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post qu@@ itted on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Foundation who has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art &quot; : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures .
&quot; I did not respect the Bible completely , but also selected for it important , also mysterious topics . &quot;
&quot; this was not collaboration on eye level , &quot; says Al@@ te@@ post : &quot; it is about the pictures , the text merely describes . &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to improve his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pics speak for ag@@ ul@@ ators both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as of the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - pap@@ er- and can@@ ou@@ ges - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition presented on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Foundation .
construction line for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
&quot; plans made to place a place , companies commissioned to model ground level for a round course : one year later almost everything was finished - but still before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was finished . &quot;
&quot; failures in politics and administration place for crimes , especially among the residents who do not want to tolerate the railway . &quot;
&quot; so hill being de@@ ported , new place sought - well with formal planning and application for building permit . &quot;
the approval will enter in October the first community of Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now available in childhood and youth affairs .
&quot; I hope this year still happen , &quot; she said . &quot;
it should then be opened without a &quot; further memorial &quot; with the works at the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensified engagement for refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B increases its engagement for refugees to 2019 , and the Bundesliga are a clear sign in the weekend . &quot;
&quot; the soccer respon@@ ds to the turning situation in Germany , enabling the policy to secure its help in tackling the upcoming problems . &quot;
&quot; I consider this to be the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no one to say in principle , that is about me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be interested in each and every individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; said the DF@@ B director Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; during the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on 23 September , he intends to discuss the refugee situation in Germany . &quot;
&quot; next Wednesday , I am in the chan@@ cell@@ or and went there to the minister@@ ial wife of E@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; here the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football could and want to help .
but the decisive turn@@ outs must be setting the policy .
the German football federation is therefore their refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a Welcome &quot; for four years extended .
&quot; beyond the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun @-@ Stiftung , we have ensured that this programme runs until 2019 , &quot; &quot; stated Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the edge at the UEF@@ A session in St. Juli@@ an@@ / Malta . &quot;
also some Bundes@@ land@@ ists support this program .
&quot; already this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ asco is a clear sign when they get on the left Tri@@ kot@@ ar instead of the usual &quot; &quot; sponsor@@ ing logos &quot; &quot; we help - # -@@ welcome . &quot;
&quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; said Le@@ af@@ us@@ ens Sport@@ di Völ@@ ler &quot; ( Tuesday ) , and referred to the project as a &quot; natur@@ al@@ ness . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama gets every day , nobody is allowed to see . &quot;
&quot; we can use football boards , no , we have to use our strength , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees that have suffered so incredibly &quot; , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
&quot; H@@ offen@@ se CEO Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to EM @-@ Quali@@ fication of Hungary at this Friday , the national team of women selected 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;

reports : SAP pre @-@ chief loses an eye in the event of accident
&quot; chief of the Group &apos;s largest software Group , Bill M@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has been lost the left eye for several reports by the fall of the beginning of July . &quot;
&quot; in the accident at the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he fell down to midnight on a water @-@ jar , which he carried out in the left hand reports the &quot; &quot; Economic Week &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he was almost stub@@ born , was power@@ less , then turned out into the street - that told us so last week , &quot; the &quot; Wi@@ fe &quot; SAP @-@ co@@ founder H@@ asso flat@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could pon@@ der his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board at Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Phil@@ osoph@@ y . &quot;
the 54 year old manager was at the meeting and &quot; fully operational . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thurs@@ days ) , he will come back to Germany in October and lead further to the software companies . &quot;
&quot; I am there for SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman of the Chi@@ asso @-@ platform , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the S@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t was com@@ mu@@ te between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer located in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; he is important to go to the public with such a personal story , &quot; said the Manager of &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; any kind can happen . &quot;
&quot; what is important to re@@ stand up again , when you notice . &quot;

soccer : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ feller in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us have finally broken in the first group play of the Europe League . &quot;
the national player will be missing the championship leader of the soccer league in the du@@ el with the FK Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 . / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot rely on him , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ck@@ les on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga to le@@ aps against Le@@ verk@@ usen , we left the BV@@ B @-@ Coach : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high exposure of his professionals , Tu@@ ck@@ les will not only change its trunk eleven but on the back position . &quot;
so he called a change on the door@@ ke@@ position .
&quot; that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ feller , compete for the place of tribal Roman Bür@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , praised the soccer teacher the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; whether from Wei@@ den@@ feller in the future be used in all Europe League games , Tu@@ ck@@ les were however open . &quot;
with a high degree of probability it will also be the second game .
&quot; the for@@ ging statement by Mit@@ player Re@@ us that the final sign of BV@@ B in the Europe League has to be the objective , holding mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for veri@@ fiable : &quot; this means Marco &apos;s not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to pick the title .
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants to play the pioneering role for Germany
&quot; in Germany , following the will of the federal government , Germany should be fron@@ trun@@ ner in the change of technological technological development . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the cabinet resum@@ ed a strategy paper from the House of Verkehrs@@ Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things attract investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ mis@@ dt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the outskirts of the ven@@ er@@ an I@@ AA from a &quot; new mobile era &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less st@@ out , &quot; &quot; said do@@ vi@@ dt . &quot;
he wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries who also come together with representatives of industry at the I@@ AA .
&quot; among other things , the strategy paper of the ministry of transport emphasises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a breeding level on digital radio station . &quot;
testing new technology currently creates a test line on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; with that the driver &quot; &quot; fails to apply any additional liability risks , &quot; the federal government wants to verify the legal framework , and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; thus , Germany aims to use for an international scale that the permitted maximum @-@ speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars of 10 to 130 km / h is raised . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the federal government wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which hitherto only regards people as a driver . &quot;
&quot; as an automated driving , the car takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
&quot; technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds . &quot;
&quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , a highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ve@@ able vehicles on public roads were to be expected only far away after 2020 . &quot;
&quot; added value in the driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the site of Germany , the authors of the study value for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; digital connectivity of the steering can lead to increased safety and efficiency in traffic , &quot; said the SPD regime S@@ ör@@ n Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of the adhesi@@ on with accidents and the security of the personal data of the drivers must be clarified . &quot;
&quot; however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are quite skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by the For@@ sa institute conducted on Wednesday at the review of the For@@ sa institute in order to ensure that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars in the coming ten years will cover , 32 percent are expected not to believe in 20 years at all , 31 percent do not believe in it at all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of respondents reck@@ on up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous cars , in the USA 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the motor@@ ists in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on an independent vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a survey of the digital magazine for Bit@@ kom appropriate , only seven percent would agree to be able to leave control during the entire trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the free@@ way , this could show about 15 percent in flowing traffic , at St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
&quot; well , every fourth would have left the car under no circumstances . &quot;
B@@ oll says team@@ - and double start at table tennis @-@ EM

the final decision will be handed down at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boys don &apos;t have it in the morning .
&quot; however , we are strong enough to also take the title without Timo on the title , &quot; said Par@@ liam@@ entary Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf , during the EM @-@ tutorial in Düsseldorf . &quot;
gone by this time on the flight to a longer @-@ term sponsor@@ ing centre in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are now no longer such a clear favourite &quot; , &quot; stated single European Champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; Ham@@ el@@ ner , who led the S@@ etz@@ als in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , was also reminded of the 2013 European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Timo also had been missing and we became European champion . &quot;
&quot; this is why we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; explained the world @-@ dress history . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an ensemble .
&quot; it is a mixture of very great fashion show , and an Wach@@ s@@ ame @-@ Gr@@ us@@ el@@ k . the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich . &quot;
the highlights : window man@@ nequ@@ ins that can look scary thanks to video proj@@ ections .
&quot; they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , which among other things became Mad@@ onn@@ a stage out@@ fits to the great star of the scene and thus that he put men into ro@@ cking . &quot;
&quot; I can no longer say today that I am the duck at the Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; before it was easy , meanwhile , it is real , &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; from the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The S@@ ide@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( V@@ ome side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is seen from September 18 at the Kuns@@ thalle of the HY@@ PO Foundation , it is a good fortune that the fashion pot@@ ter has changed his way at a viewpoint about his person . &quot;
&quot; he had actually been to the contrary , because : &quot; for me an exhibition ended a bit by death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if you die , one gets into the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been in Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it is all about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into that hardly still under the man &apos;s work , which has written fashion history without ever completed a training . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not constructed , but it is an excellent chore@@ ograph@@ ed total de@@ di@@ work , for which much effort was operated : to stabil@@ ise the dolls , for example , has been engaged in a Sty@@ list . &quot;
14 tonnes of material have car@@ ded the makers according to information of the curator Thierry @-@ Max@@ im L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
just before the start of the October Revolution there was still a special treat : a leather h@@ osen out@@ fit with Cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he was always interested in strong women ( &quot; Women are more lau@@ er than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ act@@ los Ted@@ dy is shown in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , z@@ oned o@@ dic secret application of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he has dressed in his Ted@@ dy B@@ HS for clothes , and said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; if you have a d@@ oll to play , his parents would not have allowed him to do this . &quot;
he then got the dis@@ mis@@ sal of fashion and later applied for himself .
it took the fashion journals and watched the designs of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought it off course .
for his first own fashion show he has not able to pay the modul@@ arity .
they were not allowed but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze as fashion @-@ niche
&quot; before we went to the long amp@@ er presses in and around pl@@ agu@@ ed , about , meters too . &quot;
&quot; the impressive materials and spi@@ kes resulted in a large amount for customers , which they un@@ edited , for example , to blankets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the two @-@ two fron@@ ts . &quot;
instead the fashion is again important .
&quot; in the early hours of the Pl@@ au@@ ener , Fashion played a major role , was then pushed for textile industry through the home textile industry and is now re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt calls a few examples : head in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and for regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; actually , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which brings itself to past embro@@ ider@@ y , a growing collector . &quot;
&quot; those who are not operated in the textile branch in Germany , is no longer available on the market . &quot;
we already set up half of the orders with us already .
&quot; bo@@ at@@ ched Pl@@ auen , together with nine other companies , is a member of the association linked at Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embro@@ ider@@ ies . &quot;
only they are allowed to carry the protected label .
&quot; in the last 15 years , around 80 percent of the revenue has been dis@@ continued . &quot;
private dealers in stores and also the wholesale trade there are almost no more .
our products can hardly reach customers on this path .
&quot; today , the mass mal@@ ware will be produced much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively distributed through chains . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Export continues to export , currently on Russia and the USA . &quot;
there are plenty of reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association seeks to score points through environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer was declared by the nit@@ rogen in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; &quot; this year we have introduced a seal of quality that shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt supplements : &quot; this also refers to the materials used .
diploma @-@ Chief U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berger outside Z@@ wick@@ au School Z@@ wick@@ au - at the faculty for Applied Arts - and is specialised in embro@@ ider@@ ies and sp@@ itz .
in order to meet the competition from the Asian region you have to find high quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; a clash between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the factories , which in particular must think economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design can often only be slightly different to keep a customer base . &quot;
a few years ago formed textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter new snow @-@ tip new .
the machine is stu@@ ffed at some places and small chi@@ cks .
&quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ sch@@ ie@@ de@@ master de Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Kr@@ auss gave herself to be inspired , &quot; previously I could not start with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now they use the snow@@ tip for their jewellery .
in an elaborate process it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify with the subject of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also provides to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - in particular to customers whose ancestors used in respect and surroundings and who would like to have a mem@@ ento . &quot;
&quot; with this , I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot;

XI pus@@ hes to open the economy wider to the world
&quot; the economy must open a wide view to further growth , to promote growth , said President X@@ i Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group called to reform of the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should stand up to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in an address during the 16th session of the Central Committee for the deepening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; further start @-@ ups and advance reforms will advance new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , said X@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the leadership group has adopted a set of guidelines , including a negative approach to regulate market access , relaxation of the border controls policy , promoting citizenship ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the state operator . &quot;
&quot; the statement is created a negative list , which identifies the sectors and companies that do not come into question on investment . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is crucial , as it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , a legally @-@ owned business environment and open the market more open , says the Statement . &quot;
the government will also exploit controls on the powers transferred to the enterprises and make sure companies decide how they run their business .
&quot; the statement also says that China will permit border zones to allow new models of cross @-@ border economic co @-@ operation and new mechanisms to promote growth , regional growth . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of an offer , public controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change their policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legal interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; the statement said . &quot;
&quot; moreover , it is easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; , by making the requirements optimized and the application process should be facilitated . &quot;
&quot; the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and professional judges and pro@@ secut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
&quot; at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Yun@@ shan and Z@@ hang @-@ oli , as reported in a declaration issued after the meeting was published . &quot;
EU intends to double the mer@@ cury limit in de@@ ple@@ tion
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large beasts and consumers so that a significantly higher dose of nerves .
&quot; consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who introduced a corresponding working paper in the EU , critici@@ zed the plans sharply : &quot; risks and side @-@ effects , failed and infants , &quot; stated Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t said , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic reasons &quot; can be raised by one to two milli@@ gram mer@@ cury each kilo@@ gram of fish . &quot;
large predat@@ ory @-@ fish are already so strongly dened with mer@@ cury that on the basis of the still valid threshold values about 50 percent of the cat@@ ches are not allowed to be sold .
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be approximate . &quot;
&quot; in return for this relaxation , the EU intends to ti@@ watch the limit values on other fish of currently 0.5 milli@@ gram on 0.1 milli@@ gram on 0,@@ 1 milli@@ grams per kilo@@ gram . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ood@@ watch called this but &quot; trick &quot; because smaller bur@@ ial fish , such as car@@ p mostly made so low , that they already stick to the planned maximum levels . &quot;
&quot; the ab@@ dic@@ ation of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ che of distr@@ action , which helps alone the economy , &quot; &quot; stated Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal that cat@@ fish itself up across the food chain in particular in predat@@ ors .
&quot; this is why the Federal Government is warning that &quot; &quot; small quantities are already being able to cause damage from the nervous system &quot; &quot; damage caused by the nervous damage caused by the nervous system . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Ministry of Environment explains its homepage with regard to existing maximum levels , however , that a &quot; health concern of the general population &quot; could not be expected . &quot;
Mercury is driven primarily by the coal burning in the environment .
&quot; the German coal power plants come across a written records from the Federal Ministry of Environment to the Green Par@@ liam@@ entary Ombud@@ sman , Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ ked more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total amount in Germany em@@ itted total . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish around the Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; permanent and nationwide &quot; , &quot; the &quot; mirror &quot; had quoted in March from the paper . &quot;
last year Europe @-@ wide warnings from mer@@ cury in fish have already been among the most common health risks in the EU @-@ War@@ n@@ OS R@@ AS@@ FF .
