&quot; the backup measures after the Convention are termin@@ ated with regards to nuclear material when the community and the organization determine that the material consum@@ es or has been dil@@ uted in a way that it is usable for a nuclear activity , which is no longer usable or practically non @-@ refundable . &quot;
&quot; the community is specified according to the implementation of this Convention , the distribution of core material from the states , which is subject to securing the security measures after the Convention . &quot;
&quot; the security measures after the Convention shall be termin@@ ated with regard to nuclear material , as soon as the recipient state , as envisaged in this Convention shall take responsibility for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; the organisation introduces documents , from which every transfer and the application of the backup measures to the subsequent core material will be produced . &quot;
&quot; should the core material , the backup measures are used after this agreement , in non @-@ nuclear operations , such as the manufacturing of allo@@ ys or ceramics , thus agreed to establish the community with the organisation of such use of material , under which circumstances the security measures can be ended following this agreement with regard to this material . &quot;
II ) that the candle material during the duration of the non @-@ application of securing actions after this Convention is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons .
&quot; B ) The organization and the community meet a settlement , which in this Convention will only be applied as long as the core material used in such activity . &quot;
&quot; in the scheme , as far as possible , how long and under what circumstances these backup measures will not be applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the backup measures used in this Convention will once again be applied as soon as the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organization will be based on the total amount and composition of this material , in the relevant state or in the relevant states , and on any transfer of such material from this country or these states . &quot;
&quot; this explains its approval as quickly as possible ; it extends only on matters such as tempor@@ al and proced@@ ural regulations and agreements for the coverage , but does not include endor@@ sement , or subject to confidentiality , and does not refer to the following use of the nuclear material . &quot;
&quot; the organisation , the community and the states bear the costs arising from each of them in carrying out their respective obligations under the Convention . &quot;
&quot; creating the community , the states or individuals whose territorial costs are subject to , however , an extraordinary costs as a result of a special request of the organization , so reimbur@@ sement the organization these costs , unless they pre@@ dict themselves in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organization bears the costs of all additional measurements and sampling that are requested by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states make sure that the liability of liability for nuclear damages , including insurance or other financial security , shall be avail@@ ed according to their laws and other provisions relating to the organisation and their officials for the purpose of implementing this convention in the same manner as on the nation@@ als of the states . &quot;
any claim to the community or a state against the organization or the organisation against the community or a State of damages - with the exception of damages from a nuclear incident - asser@@ ted out of the implementation of the security measures after this Convention is regulated in accordance with international law .
&quot; if the Council intends to verify the information laid out by him from the Director General Director , that the organisation is not able to prove himself through the examination , for nuclear weapons or other nuclear fire@@ places , so he may report the reports in Article XII of the Stat@@ utes , and may also take any other measures there . &quot;
&quot; taking these steps into consideration the Council , in which mass was obtained by the applied security measures of weight , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two contracting parties is concerned - each representative opportunity to give the Council the necessary safety . &quot;
&quot; if you are searching for the organization , the community or a state , consultations on questions that arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States are entitled to seek , therefore ask that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this convention , should be tested by the Council . &quot;
the Council invites the community and the state to participate in the discussion of such matters by the Council .
&quot; if there are any disputes arising from the Council to Article 19 or any of the actions taken by the Council , arising out of the interpretation or application of this Convention and which are not included in negotiation or by another from the organization , the community and the states unified proceedings , made at the request of a party at an arbitr@@ al tribunal , which consists of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States have agreed two refer@@ ee , the organization also ren@@ ders two refer@@ ee , and the four so named refer@@ ee elect a fifth , who presi@@ ding the presidency . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States or the organization were named thirty days after the request of a refer@@ ee , the community or organization can seek the President of the International Court of tribunal , this arbitr@@ ator may appoint . &quot;
the same procedure is applicable if bin@@ der dre@@ ary days after naming or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator of the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a majority of the members of the arbitration proceedings is modest , and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the decisions of the arbitration proceedings are binding for the organisation , the Community and the countries concerned . &quot;
&quot; a ) This Agreement occurs for non @-@ weapon weapons , the contracting party of the contract and are members of the community , in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organization is specified that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of the convention . &quot;

B ) This Agreement shall remain in force for as long as the states of the contract are the contract .
&quot; the term &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the protocol . &quot;
purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedure used in carrying out the provisions of the part I on backup measures as required .
the aim of the procedures laid down in this Convention is the timely discovery of nu@@ ances of nuclear weapons for un@@ familiar purposes and the de@@ terr@@ ent of such di@@ version by the risk of premature discovery .
&quot; set out in Article 28 of the target group , the material Accounting is used as a backup measure of fundamental importance , associated with the spatial reproduction and observation as important supple@@ mental measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical conclusion of the tests by the organization is performed by an explanation , in which for any material balance sheet , which is listed for a specified period of time , under specification of the accuracy of the accuracy of the stated measurement . &quot;
&quot; in carrying out their veri@@ fiable tests , the Organisation for Article 3 makes full use of the safety system of the Community . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the community for core material in accordance with this Convention is based on a division in material zones .
&quot; the use of their backup measures will make the community of de procedures and measures to make use of the following kinds of use and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee@@ able , as they are used in supple@@ mental agreements and purpose : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measurement system to determine the quantities of preserved , her@@ ded , lost , lost or in other way from the inventory of the core material and inventory ; &quot;
( B ) the evaluation of the re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and the assessment of measurement certainty ;
C ) procedures for determining the testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) method for evaluating accum@@ ulations not measured stocks and not measured losses ;
&quot; F ) has a protocol - and reporting system , which indicates the material materi@@ alistic and the changes in the material , including the one - and outputs of the material balance sheet ; &quot;
G ) Pro@@ mis@@ sibility to make sure that the procedures and agreements are performed correctly ;
( h ) Proc@@ ed@@ ure for reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in line with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the backup measures after this agreement are not related to material in mining or processing .
&quot; B ) is used pri@@ an ( or th@@ ori@@ um@@ ous material , which has not yet reached the code of the nuclear power supply in the United States , thus divi@@ des the community of organisation the quantity and composition of the material as if it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; leaves nuclear material that is suitable for composition and purity for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ rope storage , in which it is produced , or is introduced to this core material or else , at a later stage of the nuclear power supply of nuclear material into the states , so it is subject to the others in that Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The backup measures provided in this Convention shall not be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 , however , the community is subject to the recovery of nuclear material , the backup measures for which it is temporarily not possible or desirable , so consult the organization and the community to each other through the application of appropriate security measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The backup measures provided in this Convention will be completed for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , unless the organisation and the community determine that this core material is practically non @-@ refundable . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Community , the organisation fre@@ es the core material from the security measures following this Convention : &quot;
&quot; a ) special spl@@ able material , if it is used in grams - or smaller amounts than sensor in instruments ; &quot;
B ) nuclear material when used in non @-@ nuclear activities after Article 13 in case such core material is refundable .
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ open@@ con@@ centr@@ ation of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 which is over 80 % .
&quot; on request of the community exemp@@ t the organisation of nuclear material , which would otherwise be subject to security measures after the Convention , from these backup measures , provided that the whole , due to this article in the states of free material volume at no time is more than &quot;
a ) a kilo@@ gram of special p@@ age@@ able material which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with an en@@ rich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lier of its weight with the accessibility , &quot;
&quot; III ) Ur@@ an with an en@@ rich@@ ment which lies under 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the nature of natural disasters , calculated by multip@@ lier of its weight with the fifth square of the en@@ rich@@ ment ; &quot;
&quot; B ) a total of ten met@@ ric tons of natural disasters and de@@ ple@@ ted ur@@ an@@ ium , with an en@@ rich@@ ment of more than 0,@@ 00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ; &quot;
&quot; C ) twenty m@@ etr@@ ic tonnes rounded down with an en@@ rich@@ ment of 0.@@ 00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) , or among them ; &quot;
&quot; the form of core material together with nuclear material , which is subjected to securing the security measures after the Convention , be processed or stored , so precautions are made for the application of security measures on the material . &quot;
&quot; the community meets with the organization of supplements which are required to implement the successful and effective execution of the tasks of the organization in accordance with the Convention , in which to apply the procedures laid down in the Convention . &quot;
supple@@ mentary extrac@@ tions can be modified or amended without a change of the convention in the agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the supple@@ mentary withdraw@@ als occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of the Convention . the Organisation , the Community and the States undertake all efforts to enter into force nine days after the entry into force of the Convention ; an extension of this period requires a renewal between the organisation , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; the organization arises on the basis of the initial initial index of the entire , the backup measures of the whole Convention in the States , regardless of its origin , and performs this inventory due to the subsequent reports and the results of its after@@ tests . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its member states Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; in ER@@ WA@@ EG@@ ER NA@@ CH@@ STE@@ H@@ EN@@ DER GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ DE - a ) The EEC has decided to contribute to the special economic cooperation established on the conference for international economic cooperation , in order to help the immediate need of individual countries with low income , their development through general resource centre problems . &quot;
&quot; it is the aim of the EEC and the Member States that the whole of the Member States will be tied to the agreement within six months , and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will be able to make it possible . &quot;
&quot; D ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement , and the central binding , to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution in the context of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the EEC has presented a table which is evident , in which way it is intended to apply the criteria laid down in this agreement - &quot;

the special account will be separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or un@@ z@@ ins@@ al notes , which at demand in the currency of the concerned state in order of organization as administrator of the special transaction account , and at the rear @-@ country of the organisation in the concerned country are to be deposited . &quot;
&quot; B ) The payment is made in two rates , namely the first in the amount of at least 45 V . h . entry into force 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator at the agreed time ; &quot;
&quot; II ) the second amount of the balance payable amount to 1 January 1979 , or at any other time , between the EEC and the administrator , considering the deadlines necessary for parliamentary approval . &quot;
C ) Every@@ one Member State can make payments from the above @-@ mentioned deadlines .
&quot; the car@@ et@@ ter takes place in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , about the dis@@ proportion of the cash or the school , in order to cover expenses for the specific requirements and the special ac@@ tional event in an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; with the provision of these loans , the administrator must be guided in accordance with the terms and conditions of the EEC : &quot;
III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the current and fores@@ ee@@ able economic problems in the country ;
&quot; VI ) of the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service , and its wider credit capacity for borro@@ wer policy without limitation ; and &quot;
VII ) the circum@@ ference in which the problems of the respective countries are regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each promotional loan serves the financing of a clear set @-@ up and quickly exp@@ and@@ able development programme or sub@@ missions ( including a sec@@ toral committee ) , regardless of whether it has been approved and managed according to the practices of organization funded by the organization , whereby the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement is considered to be considered as the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the means of the special transaction account may not be used instead of proper means of the International Bank for Re@@ construction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation , which are tied to a program or project undertaken by the directors of the Bank or organisation by the directors of the Bank or organisation . &quot;
&quot; apart from section 4 subject to special notification of the same recovery conditions , which apply to the organisation granted to the organization ; they are therefore discounted in 50 years in each case in 50 years . &quot;
special notification has been granted in one or more of the Member States currencies and are refundable in these currencies .
amounts for the payment of this denti@@ als are directly to the organization that it retains .
&quot; each promotional loan is indicated by a separate formulation , between the beneficiaries , and the administrator , in which particular the origin of the means is indicated . &quot;
&quot; the revenue from each promotional loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the beneficiaries , or for goods or services that are manufactured in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , which are members of the organization , and the notification of what the car@@ et@@ akers have specified at the time of the loan granted , recei@@ vers of a special transaction tax . &quot;
&quot; capital withdraw@@ als are made available to the applicant , and in this manner in the currency of a member state , the amount paid to its receipt as soon as possible from the administrator to the concerned Member State . &quot;
the administrator is instruc@@ ted up to the full allocation of all promotional loan the EEC relating to the assessment by the directors in preparation and of the directors and programmes used by the directors .
&quot; during the period of payout of the special Board of Directors , the administrator has taught the EEC quarterly on the development of special editorial loan and the expenses for this . &quot;
&quot; the administr@@ ations transm@@ its the EEC as soon as possible after conclusion of the financial year of the organisation , a detailed statement of the transaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tors of the Organisation to this statement . &quot;
&quot; after full payment of the special ac@@ credi@@ ting loan , the administrative de@@ posit@@ ors of the EEC will soon be submitted to a detailed report on the projects financed by the Special Account Group and programs . &quot;
&quot; administrator is created and guides suitable records and billing , from which the contributions applied to the special account resulting from the account orders and the withdraw@@ als to the Member States are inten@@ tionally available . &quot;
the EEC and the administrators work closely to achieve the goals of this agreement .
&quot; to do this , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the bai@@ li@@ ff up to the complete issue of the special editorial account from time to time a thought exchange about the state of the special transaction account , the continuation of the programmes or projects , and about any other questions that relate to the provisions of this Agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , which the EEC and the organization agree , not into force , the agreement and all the obligations of the parties are due to immediate effect . &quot;

&quot; the governments of the Member States have quoted the conclusion of the Council of the European Communities , the conclusion of the proceedings concerned . &quot;
the Secretary @-@ tariff leads these noti@@ fications together with a Noti@@ fication of the regulatory approval of this agreement through the EEC to the Organisation .
&quot; this agreement becomes effective and occurs in force on the first day of the month , which follows the day of receipt of the aforementioned notification during the organisation . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is sealed in two sig@@ natures in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch language , each wording in accordance with the same masses . &quot;
whereas the agreement was adopted in the form of a letter to change the Annex A of the Protocol No 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss E@@ id@@ gen@@ ossen@@ schaft ( 1 ) - HA@@ T has en@@ acted the following regulation :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss con@@ federation in the field of controlled core fusion and plas@@ m@@ ap@@ hysi@@ cs
&quot; the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community , named &quot; Euratom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , below the &quot; &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot;
&quot; named &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , listed below &quot; Bundes@@ rat , &quot; listed below &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large laboratory , the project J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation of a common company named after chapter V of the Euratom Treaty - are called &quot; &quot; charitable company J@@ ET &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for several years , Switzerland has been working with research in the field of controlled fusion and plastics , and is well acquainted with the area concerned . &quot;
&quot; as far as the practical use of the controlled core fusion is still extensive work , it is in the interests of the contract parties to summar@@ ise their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary over@@ l@@ apping and to accelerate their respective research , which have gained higher pri@@ ori@@ tis@@ ation due to the energy crisis . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is intended to enable every contracting party in the position of implementing their research efforts in the field of controlled core fusion and Plas@@ tic hysi@@ cs from the resources provided for the mutual benefit , and consequently the common goal of this research work , i.e. , the cost @-@ effective electricity generation by making use of the controlled fusion reaction to achieve faster . &quot;
&quot; to reach the objective of the current agreement , the parties parties have defined their respective research programmes in Annex I and II of this agreement , the &quot; Euratom program &quot; and &quot; Swiss programme . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to ensure an effective collaboration , the Swiss program assumes the long @-@ term objectives and the forms of the cooperation of the Euratom program ; it will be extended or changed after examination in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present Agreement , which may be relevant for the Euratom program . &quot;

the association established in paragraph 1 is realized by : - adequate participation of each of the parties parties during the preparation and execution of the programmes of the other party ;
&quot; - Exchange of the personnel among the laboratories in the Euratom Member States , in Switzerland and third countries with which Euratom signed a similar agreement as the present agreement , including &quot; Associ@@ ated Third Parties &quot; as well as the laboratories that work on the Euratom program ; &quot;
- mutually exclusive access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programmes .
Switzerland at the project J@@ ET took part in the aim of the current agreement .
&quot; in view of the implementation of the association agreements aimed at implementing the contract parties , the association agreement ( called &quot; association agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those between the Commission and the States and companies or persons , below &quot; &quot; Associ@@ ated Organ@@ iz@@ ations &quot; , &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Euratom program . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Euratom had concern that Switzerland concluded with the timing of the agreement in the agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , the agreement between the Commission and the Associ@@ ated organs will be called &quot; &quot; Trade Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of the current agreement between J@@ ET and the Council of J@@ ET , whose rules are accepted . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Euratom &apos;s concerns , that Switzerland can become an affiliate of every contract , unless association agreements or other similar contracts made by Euratom during the validity period of the present Agreement . &quot;
the institutions that are commissioned with the implementation of the Association provided in Article 2 of the present agreement are described in Article 5 to 10 of this agreement and in the association agreement .
&quot; the association agreement applies in particular to the establishment of a steering committee , the responsible representative of the Commission and the Council of the Federal Council . &quot;
- to monitor the development of research work and direct the best results achieved in accordance with the objectives of this agreement .

in the form of a brie@@ fing between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ inian Republic on the trade with H@@ amm@@ el and L@@ amm@@ ates
&quot; I honour me on the recent negotiations between our delegations to establish rules on imports of H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are as follows : &quot;
- fresh or cool@@ ed H@@ amm@@ el - lamb - and goat meat ( 02 01 A IV a ) ;
&quot; within the framework of this agreement , the export possibilities for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat of Argentina are set to the following annual amount : 20 000 tons , expressed in battle @-@ body weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; to ensure a flawless functioning of the agreement , Argentina is obliged to ensure that the fact carried out the agreed quantity of quantity not sur@@ passed and executed according to conventional products ( frozen or cool@@ ed ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the supply form as a result of changes in technology and trade are possible , the two parties agreed to each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the number 10 mentioned committees in order to find adequate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community takes the protection clause , comm@@ its them to ensure that the access to Argentina &apos;s common market in this agreement is not touched . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities , the community reserves the right to susp@@ end the objection from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
the community comm@@ its itself to restrict the added value to registered users from this agreement to a Ho@@ ech@@ ing set by 10 v.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; when entering new Member States , the Community changes in consultation with Argentina under number 2 fixed quantity according to the extent of the Argent@@ in@@ ean trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the bur@@ dens for these new Member States will be fixed , pursuant to the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this shall be taken into account under number 5 named Ho@@ ech@@ el@@ ation . &quot;
the total amount of people mentioned under number 2 will be determined by the day of the accession of Greece to the community on 23 000 tons of battle .
the community takes everything to avoid market development which could affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el and lam@@ b@@ ans on the joint market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; in particular , the community takes precautions , so that the sales of intervention stocks in frozen meat is not under@@ mines due to the implementation of the regulation in the paragraph of Argent@@ in@@ ic H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the goals and regulations of this agreement , the Community agrees that each actual application of equipment and other funding measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lam@@ bs were only carried out at prices and conditions that are consistent with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of community trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are comparable in a way that is compatible with Article XVI of G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the Universal inch and trade agreement . &quot;
&quot; Argentina ensures compliance with this agreement in particular , that within the quantities specified in this agreement , the quantities are specified under number 1 of the mentioned products . &quot;
&quot; the community is obliged to meet all necessary precautions , so that the distribution of export licenses for the aforementioned products with origin in Argentina is made dependent on the submission of a export license issued by the Government of the Argent@@ in@@ ean government . &quot;
the details for the application of this system will be determined that the position of a deposit for issuing the in@@ fusion license can be avoided .
&quot; according to Direc@@ torate @-@ regulations , the competent Argent@@ in@@ ean authority of the competent authority of the Community have been issued in regular intervals , the quantities have been issued , for the export license ; these details may be in@@ cip@@ hered according to identification purposes . &quot;
the committee is concerned that the agreement is properly applied and smoothly works .
&quot; he regularly checks the tendency on the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat me@@ val market of both parties and on the world market as well as sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions that are of importance to the number 7 mentioned goals . &quot;
&quot; the committee carries out that the proper application of this agreement will not be affected by this agreement , that products from H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat were carried out under the agreement not named tari@@ ffs numbers according to the community . &quot;
the committee discussed all questions regarding the implementation of this agreement and recommends suitable solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this agreement are un@@ har@@ med by the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the total amount of the annual amount is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 .
the amount paid by force from this agreement to the 1 . January of the following year amount is determined in relation to the total annual amount and contributes to the seasonal character of trade .
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas where the Treaty is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and according to this agreement on the one hand , and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina . &quot;
&quot; it is valid up to 31 March 1984 ; at that time it remains in force , subject to the right of every party to announce it in writing with a notice period of one year . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the provisions of this Agreement shall be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes that make it necessary to verify . &quot;
I would be grateful if you share the consent of your government .
honestly me to confirm the entrance of your letter with the following wording :

&quot; to ensure a flawless functioning of the agreement , oblig@@ ated New Zealand to ensure the fact carried out the set quantity not sur@@ passed . &quot;
the pr@@ un@@ ted quantities are being executed in conventional supply forms ( frozen or cool@@ ed ) .
the community insur@@ es that New Zealand with this agreement should not be prevented from using new technological developments or to maintain a competitive position on the market of the community .

&quot; the human full blood is in steri@@ le , protected bottle of micro @-@ organisms protected and allowed to keep up to its use at a temperature of 4 to 6 C ; higher temperatures are allowed only during testing and transport required times to cool down the blood immediately on 4 to 6 C . &quot;
&quot; a concentration of human red blood cells is a unity of human perfection , from which the biggest part of the karma has been removed . &quot;
&quot; it contains all red blood cells of the unit , from which it has been won ; other blood cells may be present or may have been partially removed . &quot;
the fluid content of the concentrations consists either from the remaining plasma or from an appropriate artificial ir@@ onic fix that was taken after the removal of the plastic .
&quot; the volume of the red blood cells should be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , so the approximate percentage of the er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te @-@ volume ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ it ) is to be used on the label . &quot;

the amount consumed in a container must be so great that the content may be used to perform the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturing of manufacturing has to lead over all production levels and control of re@@ agents for the re@@ group@@ ing written records .
reasonable samples of all issued re@@ agents are so long to retain the laboratory and can be adopted by some probability that the batch is no longer used .
&quot; the re@@ agents used for blood @-@ determination can contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of them represent the effective share , the others are the necessary means to reinforce the effectiveness and the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective appeal in three groups . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that re@@ agents of human origin only contain substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents are not able to contain any substances of human origin . &quot;
