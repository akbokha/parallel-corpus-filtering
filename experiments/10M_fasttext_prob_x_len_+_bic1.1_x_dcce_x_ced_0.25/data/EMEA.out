this document is a summary of the European Public Health Auth@@ orities ( E@@ PA@@ R ) in which studies discussed how the studies carried out for human therapeutic products ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated in order to get recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or its treatment , please read the pack ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you want more information about the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , as a solution to inser@@ tion ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. Cast thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , distr@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , a mental disorder , in which the patients can have normal episodes ( periods abnormal vo@@ icing ) alternat@@ ely with periods of normal mood . &quot;
&quot; bili@@ fy is used for the treatment of moderate to heavy Man@@ ic episodes , and in the prevention of Man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past . &quot;
injection solution is used for quick control of increased anxiety or behavi@@ oral disorders if the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both conditions , the solution can be applied to one or the melting pot in patients , which are prepared using tablets difficulties . &quot;
&quot; patients , who are taking other medicines at the same time , which are just like A@@ bili@@ fy , should be adapted to the dose of bili@@ fy fy . &quot;
&quot; this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably works mainly as &quot; partial Ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ in ( also called ser@@ otonin ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ in and dop@@ amine , but in lesser extent than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters effect to enable the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ can play a role in schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thus psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms will be less@@ ened , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy , the recur@@ r@@ ence of symptoms , was investigated in three studies of up to a year . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two trials at 8@@ 05 patients with schizophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which was ill over a period of two hours by placebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in another study A@@ bili@@ fy was tested for twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ operated dol , in another study the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo to prevent re@@ occur in 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms have already been stabili@@ zed with as@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy injections was found in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , the change in the symptoms of the patients was examined on the basis of a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment . &quot;
the company also led trials to investigate how the body ton@@ ed the melting pot and the solution to tear .
&quot; in both studies with the injection solution shown patients , the A@@ bili@@ fy received in doses of 5,@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger dimin@@ ishing the symptoms of spar@@ ked anxiety than the patients receiving a placebo . &quot;
&quot; when applied to the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ time studies more effective than placebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ bili@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks of more effective than placebo the recur@@ r@@ ative episodes of previously treated patients , and when in addition to an existing treatment . &quot;
bili@@ fy injections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms spar@@ ed anxiety and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side @-@ effects of bili@@ fy fy ( observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ id@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces , headaches ( dro@@ pping ) , vom@@ iting ( dro@@ pping ) , vom@@ iting ( vom@@ iting ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ itarian Pharmac@@ eutical Research ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy had in treating schizophren@@ ia and in the prevention of a new ic episode in patients who had overwhel@@ m@@ ingly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole are predic@@ ting to the risks .
&quot; in addition , the Committee came to the outcome that the benefits of inj@@ ecting anxiety in patients with schizophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder when a oral therapy is not suitable to weigh against the risks . &quot;
June 2004 the European Commission issued Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for approval by A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is used for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the polar disorder and for the prevention of a new ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily from meals .
&quot; increased effectiveness in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , independent of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients , a lower initi@@ al@@ dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duction is removed from the combination therapy the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ izi@@ ous behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases at the beginning or after the change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy also with treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epidemi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased risk of addiction risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dinal or isch@@ a@@ emia disease ) , cervi@@ cal disease , conditions , which are applied for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood@@ shed ( including acute and mal@@ ignant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies , which was a year or less persistent , there were occasional reports of over the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dy@@ mis . &quot;
&quot; if with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y patients identified signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sp@@ readsheet , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient developed signs and symptoms that point out to a m@@ ns , or unclear , without any extra clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ otic diseases , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , must be set . &quot;
&quot; therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or in cases associated with cryp@@ to@@ cases , with caution . &quot;
56 - 99 years old with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psych@@ osis which were treated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease patients had treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison to placebo .
&quot; there was , however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the an@@ age for unwanted cervi@@ cal events treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with ket@@ ac@@ orn or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients suffering from atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related undes@@ irable events involving AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs to patients , direct comparisons . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ mer , poly@@ ur@@ ry , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gie and weakness ) can be observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of worsen@@ ing glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schizophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia , in which weight gain is known as side @-@ effect , or an unhealthy lifestyle , and could lead to severe complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nerve system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally efficient medicines involving themselves over@@ bearing side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 @-@ antagon@@ ist Fam@@ ine , an ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the reset rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , however this effect is considered as clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with healthy promot@@ ers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased AU@@ C by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole around 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to expect other highly effective inhibit@@ ors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ etine and par@@ ox@@ etine , similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose @-@ reduction . &quot;
&quot; at C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans , the joint application can result with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ dable metabol@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; if you consider the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other high @-@ effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors , the potential benefits should be ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the potential risks to the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and HIV @-@ Prot@@ eas@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose @-@ reduction . &quot;
&quot; after inser@@ ting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , the dosage should be lifted from AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y to the dosage above the beginning of the companion therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or E@@ sc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be calculated with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole are no significant effect on the metabol@@ ites of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl an / 3 @-@ methodology ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ scopy ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ phic ) .
patients should be advised to notify her doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; due to the insufficient data base to safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in animal studies , this medicine should not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits justi@@ fies clearly the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , like other anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including power vehicles , to operate , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on it . &quot;
the following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) on than under placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the listed side effects is defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schizophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , in patients infected with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total of lower incidence ( 25@@ ,@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , Acc@@ ath@@ ic , D@@ yst@@ ony and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esie ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks was the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ tern in therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3.5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under half @-@ operated treatment .
in another study about 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term recovery period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patients groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases the CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ ine @-@ phosph@@ ate gases ) , generally temporary and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole patients , compared to 2.7 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects which can occur in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , and their occurrence in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include the mal@@ ignant neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome , sp@@ ig@@ dy@@ nas@@ tic events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tionally or inten@@ tional allo@@ wan@@ ces were observed with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone with adult patients with estimated doses observed by up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information on the effectiveness of a her@@ edi@@ fication with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that mol@@ y@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose of benefits is because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has high plas@@ m@@ ap@@ per@@ ation . &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar co @-@ disorder on the combination of a particip@@ atory effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 recept@@ ors and the ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recep@@ tor as well as an excessive aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ in@@ ep@@ tive and the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recep@@ tor .
in the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks to healthy pro@@ gangs showed the sound @-@ dependent reduction in the bond of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 recep@@ tor Lig@@ anden , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and in the coup . &quot;
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 2@@ 28 schizophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms demonstrated Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to placebo a statisti@@ cally significant increase of psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a Hal@@ di@@ dol @-@ controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of responsible people who contributed to the study drug in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ operated dol 73 % ) .
&quot; current values of Mess@@ ages , which were defined as secondary study destinations , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ mine @-@ depress@@ ants scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ operated dol . &quot;
a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks to stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schizophren@@ ia showed an significantly higher reduction of decl@@ ining rate that lay at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and in 57 % under placebo .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ tern in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study involving schizophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole a over placebo superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed d@@ osing with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to placebo no superior effectiveness .
in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bee @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed up to placebo superior effectiveness in week 3 and a casual effect that was comparable to that of lithium or semi @-@ operated chips in week 12 . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also pointed to 12 a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia on such as lithium or semi @-@ operated dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which in part over 2 weeks do not contra@@ dict Li@@ thi@@ um@@ - or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ mon@@ otherapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole a superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;

based on vit@@ ro studies the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 for the stretching and hydro@@ xy@@ fication of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole are cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation period is about approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with intensive metabol@@ ites over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and with approximately 14@@ 6 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in the pharmaceutical ine@@ tics between male and female healthy proportions , as well as a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic examination of schizophren@@ ic patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a worldwide @-@ specific evaluation of the pharmaceutical ine@@ tics revealed no indication on clin@@ ically significant differences in the ethnic affili@@ ation or the effect of smoking on the pharmaceutical co@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study by Pro@@ ban@@ den with a multip@@ lier liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect with regard to impairment of liver function of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not sufficient to pull out conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;

the effectiveness of my@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a prime study where 4@@ 60 women participated with metastatic breast cancer in which about three quarters used to obtain an anth@@ rac@@ er in the past .
the effect of my@@ x@@ ane ( in all some gift respectively as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to a conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicine ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side @-@ effects ) .
&quot; in total , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 with my@@ x@@ ane patients treated patients to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients receiving conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; consider only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between drugs and survival . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , patients showed previously other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer in terms of these indicators that an@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
it may also not be used with patients who are silent or before the treatment of low ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood .
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ itarian Affairs ( CH@@ MP ) noted that my@@ x@@ ane in patients were not more effective , effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medi@@ al medicines and that in contrast to other P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs do not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side @-@ effects . &quot;

P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules stabili@@ zed which promotes the storage of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by im@@ itation of their de@@ pl@@ y@@ mer@@ isation .
&quot; this stabil@@ isation leads to a in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vit@@ ational inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ ine conve@@ ys the Trans@@ zy@@ t@@ osis of Plas@@ ma@@ ges in the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ m cells and in the frame of in @-@ vit@@ ro studies has been proven that the presence of Alb@@ um in the transport of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is supported by the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ per cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ dot@@ hel@@ i@@ ale transport is conve@@ yed by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ night@@ umin@@ tor and occurs due to the alb@@ ume Prot@@ eins Con@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) an p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of the tumor .
&quot; the use of my@@ x@@ ane for metastatic mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ voice non@@ verbal studies and 4@@ 54 patients , which were treated in a random@@ ized phase III study study . &quot;
&quot; in a study 43 patients with metastatic mamm@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma treated with my@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic Mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; this multi @-@ centric study was performed in patients with metastatic mamm@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma that received every 3 weeks a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , either in the form of sol@@ vent @-@ handed p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medi@@ cation ( N = 225 ) or in the form of my@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised public condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ as@@ els . &quot;

&quot; • Training Bro@@ ch@@ ure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the drug ( subject information ) , labelling and pack . • With un@@ ambiguous representation of the product &apos;s correct cooling boxes for transport through the patient . &quot;
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed it is similar to a biological medicine which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also &quot; Re@@ ference Manual &quot; ) .
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood vessels , where in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications arise in case of the intervention a self @-@ bleeding is not possible and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor , who owns experience in the treatment of patients with disease , for which the drug is shown . &quot;
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self @-@ bleeding , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ene . &quot;
the injection may also be made from the patient or its super@@ visor as provided that they have received an appropriate guidance .
&quot; patients with chronic kidney failure / in@@ suffici@@ ency , or in patients who receive chemotherapy should always lie in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per year of adult or between 9,@@ 5 and 11 g / d@@ l in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients are before treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by a er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ od@@ ine deficiency or thereby , that the body does not sufficiently address the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used to increase the number of red blood cells , thereby reducing the consequences of a loss of blood . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a cell , into which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced , which it inspir@@ es to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed was inj@@ ected into a V@@ ene as an injection in a V@@ ene in a prime study with 4@@ 79 patients , who suffered from an@@ a@@ emia , with the reference agent . &quot;
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ ene before they were either transferred to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the change in the bun@@ ches between the beginning of the study and the distribution period in weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin has been studied with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
&quot; in the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ ost@@ al land@@ values of patients were maintained on Ab@@ se@@ amed , were maintained on the same measure , as in those patients , who continue to be E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , the patients continue to received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase from 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / d@@ l of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / d@@ l . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which may occasionally lead to symptoms of a encephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , ste@@ ed mig@@ raine headaches and con@@ fu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be applied in patients , which may possibly exceed ( allergic ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , as further studies are required to make sure that by no allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ itarian Affairs ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that for Ab@@ se@@ amed , according to the provisions of the European Union of detection , this medicine has been a comparable quality , security and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company , which determines the se@@ amed event , is provided for medical professional personnel in all Member States information , including information on the security of the drug . &quot;
August 2007 announced the European Commission of Medi@@ ce medicine P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co . kg requ@@ esting the approval of Ab@@ se@@ amed in the entire European Union .

a rise in the cabinet bin@@ s by more than 2 g / d@@ l ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should be avoided over a period of four weeks .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , occasionally in a patient can occasionally be observed individually by one patient &apos;s individual tick @-@ core values or under the corner of the corner . &quot;
in view of this tick @-@ glo@@ bin@@ ability should be tried over an appropriate dose management system that hem@@ mo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / d@@ l ( 6.@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to reach 12 g / d@@ l ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

&quot; the iron substitution should be started as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ ologist blood@@ stream program , so that before the beginning of the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy large rail@@ reserves are available . &quot;
&quot; 6 The recommended Dos@@ age amounts to 600 mm / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once weekly over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgical procedure and on the day of the surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this context , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given to 300 mg / kg every 10 consecutive days before , on the day of the surgery , as well as 4 days immediately after . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis can be given by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic cooking solution , in order to rin@@ se the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation . &quot;

8 For patients with chronic kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency should not be exceeded in line 4.2 recommended upper limit of the hem@@ mo@@ glob@@ in target concentration in paragraph 4.2 .
in clinical studies an increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular diseases was observed when Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ genesis ( ESA ) have been given by a Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ - target concentration of over 12 g / d@@ l ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefits to be attributed to the gift of epo@@ et@@ ins when the hem@@ ost@@ al bin@@ ational effect is increased on the level of control of an@@ em@@ ic symptoms and the prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the cabinet bin@@ der should amount to approximately 1 g / d@@ l ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / d@@ l ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of hypertension .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evi@@ denti@@ al coron@@ ary heart failure or storage in@@ suffici@@ ency should not be exceeded in line 4.2 recommended upper limit of the hem@@ mo@@ glob@@ in target groups .
&quot; according to present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia associated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency that are not yet di@@ aly@@ zed , the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency is not accelerated . &quot;
cancer patients should be considered for evaluating the treatment efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and the Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin @-@ response ( patients who may be trans@@ vers@@ ed ) .
if the H@@ B increase is larger than 2 g / d@@ l ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) which is exceeded per month or a H@@ B value of 13 g / d@@ l ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) must minimize the risk for possible anthrop@@ ic events ( see Section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy medi@@ ated an@@ emia - tin @-@ adjustable between 10 g / d@@ l and 12 g / d@@ l ) .
&quot; the decision for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ etine should be based on a health risk assessment involving the respective patients , which should also take into account the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; in patients , intended for a larger electrical orthop@@ edic surgery , if possible , prior to the start of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ a@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo a greater electrical orthop@@ edic surgery , as it should have an increased risk of thro@@ bot@@ anic and vas@@ cular disease , especially in a underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; moreover , it cannot be excluded that in treating epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with a starting point range of &gt; 13 g / d@@ l an increased risk of post@@ operative anthrop@@ ic / vas@@ cular events can exist . &quot;
several controlled studies were not proven for epo@@ chs that they could improve the overall survival with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of progression .
&quot; 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received an chemotherapy regim@@ en , when a Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / d@@ l ( 7,5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was aimed at &quot;
&quot; is applied epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa along with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in , should the blood levels of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in controlled and the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ ind@@ le should be adapted to the increasing hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ it . &quot;
from in @-@ vit@@ ro studies in tumor research there is no evidence of interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM CS@@ F with regard to hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .

the most common side @-@ effect during the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of existing hyper@@ ton@@ ations .
an increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ vas@@ cular events ( see Section 4.@@ 4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients under treatment with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
independent of the Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin @-@ treatment it can come with surgical patients with cardiovascular disease and vas@@ cular complications .
&quot; the genetically modified epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ col , and is identical to the amino acids and carbohydrates , and with the endo@@ genous human human@@ ism poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine . &quot;
&quot; it could be demonstrated by means of cultures of human bone market cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulated the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ese , and the leu@@ kop@@ o@@ ese does not influence . &quot;

survival and progression were examined in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blin@@ de plac@@ e@@ controlled trials and
&quot; in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between the human@@ ized human@@ ism and patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ism and patients . &quot;
in these studies dealing with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ly Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients with an@@ a@@ emia due to several common mal@@ ign@@ ancies consistent an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality rate than with the controls . &quot;
the overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ osis and related complications in combined with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ism Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin @-@ treated patients and in controls .
&quot; there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ genic events in tum@@ our patients , which can be treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ism Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative impact on the overall survival cannot be excluded . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results can be transmitted to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ism Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tum@@ our patients , who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim to transfer a tick @-@ level below 13 g / d@@ l since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the audi@@ ted data . &quot;
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ provisions following repeti@@ tive intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy pro@@ gangs and a somewhat prolonged half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injections are the ser@@ um mirror of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa much lower than the ser@@ um mirror that can be obtained after intraven@@ ous injection .
&quot; there are no sorrow : the ser@@ um mirror remain unchanged , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
( bone fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be attributed to a secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of her@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis patients , which were treated three years by epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the incidence of bone fibro@@ sis was treated to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients , which were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; 14 In animal trials , with approximate the 20@@ times of applying to the people recommended , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to dimin@@ ished body weight , towards a delay of the oscill@@ ation and to a rise in feder@@ ate mortality . &quot;

a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and the desired effect should be taken into account for the assessment of the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood c@@ els ( hem@@ mo@@ glob@@ in ) and tailor your se@@ amed dose to keep as low as possible .
&quot; this risk should be weigh@@ ed over from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa derived advantages very carefully , e.g. if you have an increased risk of thro@@ bot@@ anic vas@@ cular events , e.g. if you have been obes@@ e ( e.g. a deep ven@@ er@@ thro@@ mb@@ osis or pneum@@ onia ) . &quot;
&quot; in case you are a cancer patient , keep in mind that Ab@@ se@@ amed may work as a growth factor for blood cells and in certain circumstances the tum@@ our can affect neg@@ atively . &quot;

&quot; if your values are too high in the red blood @-@ offs ( hem@@ mo@@ glob@@ in ) , you should not get se@@ amed as an increased risk for bleeding @-@ formation after the surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if you use other medicines or have recently been taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; if you take Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( funds for the suppression of the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor will al@@ locate certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; laboratory studies have no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F ) and GM CS@@ F means a means to build the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or with HIV ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on how your blood poverty ( an@@ a@@ emia ) refers to treatment , the dose can be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
your doctor will be able to arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment company and make sure that the medicine is right and your hem@@ ost@@ net is not sur@@ passed a certain value .

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ opause and in men .
&quot; it is applied in patients with a high risk of frac@@ ture ( bone qu@@ arri@@ es ) , including in patients , who have suffered a least trau@@ matic ridge such as in the case ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip correc@@ tions should be obtained before the first in@@ fusion a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by inj@@ ecting into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; administration of acet@@ am@@ in@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( funds against inflammation ) just after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce the symptoms , like fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may be used by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data material for Zom@@ eta was used for the evaluation of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; during the first study , nearly 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis and the number of vert@@ ebr@@ ations and hip sions were examined over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study covered 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who suffered recently a frac@@ ture ; it was investigated the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies on a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with ris@@ kl@@ or@@ ate ( another Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was whether the salary of the alkal@@ ine Ph@@ osph@@ at@@ ase in Ser@@ um ( an enzyme to expand the bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the output value .
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of spinal cord in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis may be reduced over a period of three years compared to the patients under placebo over 70 % . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients , under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ otic medicines ) with those under placebo the risk of hip correc@@ tions was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study involving men and women with hip correc@@ tions 9 % of the patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 from 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less common in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be applied in patients who may possibly exceed ( allergic ) against customs , or other Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; as with all Bis@@ sau , patients are subject to patients at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to the risk of kidney and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( de@@ die of bone tissues ) in the ja@@ ws . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides information material for physicians to prescri@@ be A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , the evidence contains how to apply medicine , as well as a similar material for patients , in which the drug side effects are explained and pointed out when they should turn to the doctor . &quot;

the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men is recommended a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a once a year .
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic injury , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the operational care of the hip re@@ frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should be used by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
&quot; following a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a long R@@ emis@@ sive period was observed in patients who have addressed the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ injury hip re@@ frac@@ ture , an initi@@ al@@ dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 - i.e. or@@ ally or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended in front of the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , may be reduced by the gift of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
patients with kidney dysfunction ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) For patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this patient @-@ group .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A tin adap@@ table is not necessary , since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of elderly patients are similar to younger . &quot;
children and young people A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age as data relating to un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able and efficacy .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because this patient population is limited to limited clinical experience .
an existing hypo@@ kal@@ der@@ emia is before the beginning of the therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a through adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the fast setting of the effect of Zol@@ ed@@ ir@@ c acid on bone structure , a temporary hypo@@ cr@@ ite can develop whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , bad oral hygiene ) should be weigh@@ ed before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate a dental treatment with appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental surgery , no data are available whether the interruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk for oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the oral area . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the prescri@@ bing doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and be based on an individual benefits risk assessment .
&quot; the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , may be reduced by the gift of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of as a serious side @-@ effect reported cases of atri@@ al wor@@ sen was increased in patients , the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis ( P@@ FT , H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fr@@ ac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the overall prevalence of atri@@ al wor@@ sen between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.@@ 6 % ) and placebo ( 2.2 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , &quot;
kidney dysfunction was associated with kidney dys@@ functions that are expressed as acceptance of the kidney function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the modification of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a restricted kidney function were compared to three years compared to the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ ine and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in ser@@ um Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of the gift was observed by 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated to 0.@@ 8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the lab equipment , the temporary as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic lime @-@ values entered in a large clinical trial ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , at 2,3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical trial , compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies . &quot;
all patients received supple@@ mented sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study to post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis in the study on avoiding clinical questionn@@ aires after a re@@ frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; in the study on avoiding clinical questionn@@ aires , the vitamin D mirror were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , however the majority of patients received an Initi@@ al@@ dose vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions after the administration of customs clearance in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion location , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reports ( 0.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the j@@ aw was occasional , particularly in cancer patients , via oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primarily in the j@@ aw ) reported that were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , including customs clearance . &quot;
many of these patients had evidence of local infections including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients following tooth extraction or other dental surge@@ ons .

&quot; in case of an over@@ dose which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ der@@ emia , can be achieved by offering of oral calcium and / or a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ at a balance . &quot;
clinical effectiveness in treating the post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( P@@ FT ) The effectiveness and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either two slight or medium @-@ heavy vert@@ ebr@@ ations or a BM@@ D @-@ score for the Schengen governance process .
effects on morph@@ ometric formations of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a lowered significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new vert@@ ebr@@ ates ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated patients aged 75 years and older we had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal fluid compared to placebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0.@@ 00@@ 01 ) .
effects on Hü@@ b@@ frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a proved an abi@@ ding effect for three years working in a by 41 % ( 95 % CI - 17 % up to 58 % ) reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures .
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a raised the bone density at the lum@@ bar spine , hip and the dist@@ al radius compared to the placebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;

bone hist@@ ology with 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ ot@@ eric patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken a year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies from the pelvic area .
a micro@@ computer@@ ised ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed in line with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients compared to placebo an increase in the carrying volume of bone mar@@ row .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine Ph@@ osph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale Pro@@ pe@@ p@@ ti@@ d of the type I@@ - Col@@ lagen ( b @-@ CT@@ X ) in Ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ X ) in Ser@@ um were determined in sub @-@ groups from 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 24@@ 6 patients in perio@@ dic intervals during the duration of study .
the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months in comparison to the output value and was held at 28 % below the output value to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the output value to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ X was significantly reduced by 61 % below the starting point after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the output value to 36 months .
&quot; vitamin D mirrors were not tested rout@@ in@@ ely , but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 - i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks in front of in@@ fusion . &quot;
the overall plac@@ ality was at 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated with 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON R@@ FT study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment compared to placebo treatment the BM@@ D in the total th@@ ig@@ s and th@@ kel@@ eton as at all times .
the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment conducted more than 24 months compared to placebo treatment to increase in BM@@ D by 5.2 % of the total th@@ ig@@ s and 4.@@ 3 % to the leg .
clinical effectiveness in men In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON R@@ FT study were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was judged within 24 months .
the study was not designed to reduce the reduction of clinical trials in men ; the incidence of clinical freight tours was 7.5 % at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % on placebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 44@@ 6@@ M2@@ 30@@ 8 ) the once annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a compared to once weekly gift of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate related to the percentage of the lum@@ bar @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months in comparison to the output value .

11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg / em@@ ir@@ onic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily during 2 months was detected in two six months comparison studies .
the combined results were observed after 6 months a similar decrease of pain and pain failure compared to the output value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ sive study at the end of six months ( on the therapy ) could be included in a post @-@ observ@@ ance phase .
&quot; from the 143 with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and the 107 with ris@@ er @-@ treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic treatment could be maintained in 141 of the patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , compared to 71 of the last period of observation of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; unique and multi @-@ time 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg customs clearance in 64 patients , the following pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be dose @-@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma level rose rapidly from &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi@@ ph@@ as@@ sic disappearance from the big cycle with half @-@ life @-@ times t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ , 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long Eli@@ min@@ ation phase with a tempor@@ al elimination of temporary elimination of ½ g in 14@@ 6 hours . &quot;
&quot; the early judgment phases ( α and β , with the above mentioned ½ - values ) , probably represent the rapid Res@@ or@@ ption into the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 hours you find 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose : 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ influenced by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the in@@ fusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of customs clearance by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation against time ) . &quot;
&quot; a dimin@@ ished Clear@@ ance by Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ atic metabolic substances is impro@@ bable , because Zol@@ agi@@ c acid is not metabo@@ li@@ zed by humans and because it is a qu@@ ant or no direct and / or irreversible , hydrogen addic@@ ted In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ - &quot;
special patient groups ( see Section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Zol@@ agi@@ c acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance which was 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance and was in the 64 examined patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 @-@ 143 ml / min ) .
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney disorder up to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require a dosage adjustment of customs clearance .
&quot; as for severe kidney disorder ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ely Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data , there are no statements available for this population . &quot;
acute toxicity The highest not let@@ al intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous dose was in mice 10 mg / kg body weight and with rats 0,@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; for studies in dogs , single doses from 1,@@ 0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; intraven@@ ous and chronic toxicity in studies with intraven@@ ous application was administered in intervals of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , administered in intervals of 2- 3 weeks ( an accumulated dose which corresponds to the 7@@ 82 of the human therapeutic exposure , related to AU@@ C , corresponds to AU@@ C ) . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated application with cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects occurred among other organs , including the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts and the liver , as well as to the intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; the com@@ mon@@ est reimbur@@ sement of studies with repeated application was a multip@@ lier Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the metap@@ hysi@@ cal of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all doses , a report that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ resor@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;

&quot; Zol@@ onic acid is a representative of a sub@@ stan@@ z@@ est class , which is called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , above all o@@ estrogen made from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in rather gradual loss of bone mass that observed in men . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get occurs in bone structure too fast , and new bone material is constructed un@@ arranged , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a works by making the bone structure again norm@@ alized , thereby making a normal bone formation safer and thus gives strength to the bones . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or have to undergo a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff when you use other medicines or have recently been taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor it is particularly important to know if you take medications , of which is known to damage the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a along with food and drinks , you worry that you can take sufficient fluids according to your doctor &apos;s instructions and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ene .
&quot; if you have recently cr@@ ush the hip , the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended to make two or more weeks after the operational care of the hip . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg , which is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; as A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a works for a long time , you may possibly need another dose after a year or longer . &quot;
&quot; it is important to follow these instructions carefully , so that the calcium mirror is not too low in your blood in time after in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get may take A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a for longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
when the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a has been missed Set@@ ting you with your doctor or hospital in order to arrange a new appointment .
&quot; before ending the therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a Falls you consider the end of treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , take note of your next doctor &apos;s date and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion are very common ( with more than 30 % of patients ) but are less common after the subsequent in@@ fusion .
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ ache , occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; currently it is unclear whether A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you have such symptoms notice after you get A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; physical signs due to low calcium levels in the blood , such as muscle cr@@ amps or kri@@ p@@ tive or num@@ b@@ ly feel , particularly in the area around the mouth . &quot;

continued pain and / or non @-@ healing wounds in the mouth or on the ja@@ ws were reported above all in patients who were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate due to other diseases .
&quot; more than allergic reactions , including rare cases of breathing problems , Nes@@ sel@@ aus@@ al and angi@@ o@@ ö@@ dem ( such as swelling in the face , the tongue , or in the throat ) , has been reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects you have severely affected or you notice unwanted effects which are not listed in this use information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until the application ; normally , 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C. &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently exp@@ ired low @-@ injury hip , the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the operational care of the frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; before and after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , patients must be sufficiently supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients who receive a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the fast setting of the effect of Zol@@ ed@@ ir@@ c acid on bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ cr@@ ite can develop whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , according to at least twice a day 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently exp@@ ired low @-@ injury hip , a starting dose is recommended from 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 - i.e. or@@ ally or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D in front of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;

a summary of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public . this document is a summary of the European Public Health Auth@@ orities ( E@@ PA@@ R ) in which studies carried out how the studies carried out for human therapeutic products ( CH@@ MP ) conducted in order to get recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( in particular overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) is not used together with another di@@ abet@@ es@@ medicine ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
&quot; in addition to met@@ form@@ in patients ( in particular , overweight patients ) that can be used with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose may not be satisfac@@ tor@@ ily adjusted . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ um or insulin , the present dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ines or insulin can be maintained in the beginning of the account treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here should the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ esis ( low blood sugar ) should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body @-@ own insulin can be improved in better and the blood sugar mirror , causing type @-@ 2 diabetes to be better set . &quot;
&quot; with more than 1 400 patients studied the effectiveness of accounts in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; in doing so , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ mo@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates , how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which indicates that the sugar consumption reduced in the application of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional gift from Ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ ic har@@ n@@ ent in a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , whereas the additional gift of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of accounts and insulin was examined in 2@@ 89 patients , the patients received an additional reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients who additionally took placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual dys@@ functions , infections of the upper air@@ ways ( dro@@ wn@@ ings ) , weight gain and hypo@@ dies@@ thesia ( dimin@@ ished sensitivity to stimul@@ us ) . &quot;
&quot; accounts must not be applied in patients who may possibly exceed ( allergic ) towards pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , still in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ x ( high ket@@ one levels - in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; it has been decided that Ac@@ tos can serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in patients , where met@@ form@@ in is not shown . &quot;
October 2000 the European Commission issued the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to approve the approval of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , curved and wear on one side the mark@@ er &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the ins@@ cription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also shown for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin , and with which met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ toler@@ ability is un@@ suitable ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age are not available , so the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from the presence at least a risk factor ( e.g. former heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose @-@ by @-@ stage . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or oils , particularly those with reduced cardiovascular reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and oils , when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is applied in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardi@@ ac Out@@ come study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro @-@ vas@@ cular disease has been performed .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports of cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency showed that , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
patients with increased output liver enzymes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x Ober@@ border of the norm@@ ality ) or with other signs of liver disease may not be used Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .
&quot; if the AL@@ T @-@ mirror is increased to the 3 @-@ times of the upper range , the liver enzymes are as soon as possible to control . &quot;
&quot; in case a patient symptoms are developing to point out on a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , fatigue , appetite , appetite and / or dark resin , are the liver enzymes . &quot;
the decision whether the patient treatment will be continued with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be headed by the pre@@ clinical parameters of the clinical evaluation .
in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can be expressed by fats and in some cases associated with hydr@@ ation .
as a result of a hem@@ ophi@@ lia performed in the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on a mar@@ ginal reduction of the medium @-@ gl@@ are binary values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.@@ 1 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in comparative studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of the hem@@ ost@@ al bin@@ s around 3 @-@ 4 % and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , in patients , the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is composed as or@@ al branch or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ ic combination therapy with insulin gene , the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch was reported under the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ an , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , on an occurrence or a deterioration of a diabe@@ tic bro@@ o@@ ath with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ ders when patients report about interference of visual acu@@ ity ; an appropriate ophthalm@@ ologic analysis should be considered .
&quot; in a summary analysis of reports of unwanted events concerning bone mar@@ ching from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blin@@ ded clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one &quot;
&quot; actu@@ ation charges amoun@@ ted 1,@@ 9 Fra@@ k@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in the women &apos;s Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one for women and 1,@@ 1 frac@@ tures for women who were treated with a comparative drug . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.@@ 0 replies per 100 patient @-@ years ) with patients treated with a comparative drug . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wants to be pregnant or this occurs , the treatment is to be taken ( see Section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies for examining the interactions have shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on the pharmaceutical co@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines that are metabo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ Can@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ er are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ us ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one around the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction of AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that in treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one that dimin@@ ished in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance and thereby reduce the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the federal growth .
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequent &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( not invaluable ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ ors , and the fraction of the lens , as they also observe in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ analog desc@@ ents over the triple of the upper limit of the standard as often as under placebo but rarely more often than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff . &quot;
&quot; in an out@@ come study in patients with existing advanced macro @-@ vas@@ cular disease , the frequency of severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was by 1.6 % higher than under placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on b@@ z@@ w . &quot;
&quot; since the market launch was rarely reported via cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , however , if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was applied in combination with insulin or in patients with cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; it was conducted a summary analysis of reports of unwanted events relating to bone mar@@ tens , controlled , double @-@ blin@@ ded clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated groups and over 7.@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with comparisons . &quot;
&quot; in over a period of 3.5 years ongoing pro@@ active study , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ) who treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one patients , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a comparative drug . &quot;
&quot; with taking the recorded maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days occurred no symptoms . &quot;
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to work on an activation of specific nuclear power recept@@ ors ( per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome pro@@ lifer@@ ator Re@@ ep@@ tor @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) that leads to an increased insulin @-@ sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal cells . &quot;
it could be demonstrated that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripher@@ al glucose result in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time until the after@@ glow of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the start of therapy , a blood sugar inspection ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) with 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) are maintained . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo@@ x study about 12 months , patients whose blood sugar has been inadequate , despite a three @-@ month &apos;s Optimi@@ zation phase with insulin , was random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c reduced value around 0.@@ 45 % , compared to the patient , who still only received insulin , a reduction of insulin in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one group . &quot;
in clinical studies over one year proved to be a statisti@@ cally significant significant decrease of the album in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ quot@@ i@@ ent compared to the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small group on 18 weeks to evaluate Type @-@ 2 diabe@@ tics .
&quot; in most clinical trials , compared to placebo a reduction of the overall plasma @-@ gl@@ yp@@ el@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and a increase in the HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as slightly more clin@@ ically increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels observed . &quot;
in clinical studies over a period of up to two years reduced Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de are the total plas@@ tique and increased fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; compared to placebo , under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was not observed a statisti@@ cally significant increase in the L@@ DL cholesterol levels , while under met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de dimin@@ ished values . &quot;
in a study of 20 weeks the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one study reduced not only the so@@ ber @-@ tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial elevated level of tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ ons as well as to the hep@@ atic tri@@ gl@@ yp@@ el@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular disease study , 52@@ 38 patients were random@@ ized with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing macro@@ vas@@ cular disease in groups , in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; after oral application Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , whereby the peak concentrations to be achieved in imm@@ utable pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma usually 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is the effectiveness of the effectiveness of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; interactions could be proven that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on the pharmaceutical co@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) or lo@@ wers the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after oral use of radio@@ active marking pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the mark@@ er was mainly found in subjects ( 55 % ) and to a lower extent in the har@@ n ( 45 % ) . &quot;
the middle Plasma Eli@@ min@@ ation period of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one amounts to people 5 @-@ 6 hours and that of the whole active Met@@ abol@@ ism is at 16 - 23 hours .
the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its Met@@ abol@@ ites are lower compared to patients with reduced kidney function less than in healthy proportions . but the instal@@ ments of the oral clearing of the cervi@@ cal but resem@@ ble .
&quot; toxic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkey @-@ tuned after repeated administration with hem@@ ophi@@ lia , an@@ a@@ emia and rever@@ sible ex@@ centric heart hyper@@ trop@@ y . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that in the treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one that dimin@@ ished in the structure of hyper@@ insulin , and increased insulin resistance , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the federal growth . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) were induc@@ ed in the rat increased inci@@ dences of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( with male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( with male rats ) of the ur@@ inary epitheli@@ um .
in an animal @-@ model of the family @-@ aden@@ om@@ at@@ ous poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ ants led to an increased frequency of colon@@ tum@@ ors .
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , flat and wear on one side the mark@@ er &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the ins@@ cription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.@@ 0 replies per 100 patient @-@ years ) with patients treated with a comparative drug . &quot;
in another study two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with each pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were investigated .
in clinical studies over 1 year the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was consistently reported a statisti@@ cally significant reduction of the album in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ quot@@ i@@ ent compared to the output values .
in a study of over 20 weeks Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was not only the so@@ ber @-@ tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial elevated level of tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ ons as well as to the hep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
&quot; although the study was missing the target with regard to its primary end@@ point , which resulted in a combination of the overall ality , non @-@ deadly m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ally , stroke coron@@ ary ar@@ isation and re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arteries , put the results close that with the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no cardiovascular risk risks . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , flat and wear on one side the mark@@ er &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the ins@@ cription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ans was diagnosed in a total of 2@@ 94 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as can &apos;t produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ mo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates , how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ans led to a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c Spi@@ eg@@ els , which pointed out that the blood sugar levels were similar as with another human@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ans should not be applied in patients , who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human@@ ized ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , doses of acet@@ aph@@ aph@@ an may need to be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the full list is to be found in the pack @-@ board ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ itarian Pharmac@@ eutical Research ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of acet@@ aph@@ ine to weigh in the risks of diabetes .
October 2002 the European Commission issued the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S to approve the approval of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ans across the European Union .
mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice a day when a quick initi@@ ale effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injections must be kept under the skin at least 6 seconds to ensure that the whole dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood sugar has improved greatly , for example , by an intensive insulin therapy , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia war@@ ves can perceive significantly and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change in relation to strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin @-@ type insulin ( quickly effective , bi@@ ph@@ as@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNS against insulin in animal origin ) can cause a change in the dosage is needed . &quot;
&quot; if a dosage is required when changing to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ ans , this can be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after a change from animal to human insulin , reported that early warning @-@ symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different than with their previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; traveling to travel across multiple time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor since such trips can lead to that insulin or meals should be applied or taken at other times . &quot;
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions with the therapy and always ask for their patients to other drugs .

hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can develop however in stages : • Un@@ less hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ics can be treated by oral in@@ supply of glucose and sug@@ ary foods .
&quot; diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape variety , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sugar @-@ containing fruit juice . • gravity hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ics with consci@@ ous@@ nesses will be treated with in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injections of glucose ( 0.5 to 1.@@ 0 mg ) or given by glucose , intraven@@ ously through the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect starts within half an hour , the actual maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours , and the total period is up to 24 hours . &quot;

a number of spro@@ ckets ( hydro@@ ly@@ se@@ - ) places on the human @-@ insulin molecule has been considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites made by the split is active .
&quot; based on conventional studies on security resistance , toxicity , toxicity , gen@@ ic@@ ity , car@@ cin@@ o@@ genic potential and to reproduction , pre@@ clinical data can be seen no special dangers for human beings . &quot;

&quot; Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already signs of cryst@@ alli@@ zation , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or poison@@ ous node ( &quot; stones &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid level lies after two to four weeks still over 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ite , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months still gyp@@ sum incidents ; therefore , it is recommended that patients should take at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic even further medicines to prevent toxic waste . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transp@@ l@@ ant because it was not investigated for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , attended by the 1 0@@ 72 patients , the effectiveness of thre@@ e@@ con@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) compared with a placebo ( head@@ phone ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine to treat hypertension ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of Adenauer ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ gically in@@ ol was applied in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients whose ureth@@ ra was in the blood during the last three measurements under 6 mg / d@@ l .
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients , the aden@@ ur@@ ic participated in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who once spent 120 mg once daily , with the last three measurements a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of under 6 mg / d@@ l . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was in 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and with no of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adenauer ( observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headaches , diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea ( nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients suffering from heart disease , there is also an increased risk of certain side @-@ effects which affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ itarian Affairs ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the reduction of ur@@ ic acid pi@@ an in the blood but also a higher risk of side @-@ effects associated with the heart and the blood vessels .
&quot; treatment of chronic hyper@@ uri@@ tic emia in diseases , which have already led to ur@@ an@@ deposits ( including one from the medical history known or current toxicity and / or a Gi@@ cht@@ arthritis ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ser@@ um so@@ cle in accordance with 2 @-@ 4 weeks still is &gt; 6 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , a dosage can be considered at AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 times a day . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney activity , the efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ely Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents therefore have no experience with children and young people , the application of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate is not recommended in this group of patients . &quot;
organ@@ transplan@@ tat@@ too As there is no experience at organizing transplan@@ ts . the application of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate is not recommended in this group of patients ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease For patients with isch@@ a@@ emia disease or de@@ compensation cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency is not recommended for treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ ac@@ ulous medicines , it may come during the treatment period to an acute gyp@@ sum , because of the reduction of the ser@@ um har@@ ming pi@@ eg@@ els initially to be mobili@@ zed in the tissues . &quot;
&quot; B. with mal@@ ignant diseases and their treatment , readers and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - ny@@ han syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine can be so widespread in rare cases that it comes to a de@@ hydr@@ ation in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; liver disease Dur@@ ing the clinical studies of phase 3 , slight abnorm@@ alities of the liver function were observed in patients with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate treated patients ( 3.5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore recommended to perform before the start of the F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s treatment , and in the further course depending on the clinical findings of a liver function ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ in Z@@ s were not carried out in@@ effective studies on F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ or could lead to a rise in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line mirror ( a inhi@@ hibition of the metabol@@ ites by The@@ ophy@@ l@@ in was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .

in clinical studies the application of Nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase in unwanted events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ ella / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate can be used together with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or in@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dosage adjustment for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate or the other active substance .

&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid , the Magn@@ esi@@ um@@ hydro@@ x@@ id and aluminium @-@ hydro@@ x@@ id contains , the recording of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) delays and a drop in the C@@ max 32 % , but not a significant change in AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies can not be attributed to side @-@ effects of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
&quot; experimental studies do not leave direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful with the taxes of a vehicle , service of machines or in the exercise of hazardous activities , until they can be quite sure that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC is not influenced their performance . &quot;
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of the test reported cardiovascular events was observed in the total f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient @-@ years ) and in long @-@ term treatment studies ( 1,4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient @-@ years ) were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate has been found .
the risk factors in these patients were an arter@@ ial erotic disorder and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ally or a de@@ compensated cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency in the medical history .
&quot; ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 ) and rare ( DU@@ 1 / 1000 ) and the ( test evaluation ) in connection with the medicine could be described below and in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate treatment groups all over once were listed below . &quot;

&quot; 7 Off@@ ene long @-@ term studies in the open long @-@ term treatment studies were treated with 9@@ 06 patients up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the treatment @-@ related events related during long @-@ term studies were similar to those reported in the studies of Phase 3 ( see table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events have been reported in all f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s with a total of more than once , and occurred in patients who received F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term studies ( up to 4 years with a exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patients ) , according to some cases . &quot;

clinical studies results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and f@@ act study as described below ) which has been conducted with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ k@@ emia and g@@ out .
&quot; this primary host point was in every study of the proportion of patients , where the last three month of certain ser@@ um so@@ ils are &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a ser@@ um Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine to study course of &gt; 1.5 mg / d@@ l and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study demonstrated within 6 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) ( see table 2 and figure 1 ) the statisti@@ cally significant superiority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ act study showed a significant significant superiority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional dosage Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg daily .
patients received with ser@@ um Cre@@ ate ( 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / d@@ l ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summar@@ ized for the analyses . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol to # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg
the reduction of the ser@@ um har@@ dy species on &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor &apos;s visit in week 2 and kept permanently over the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um Cre@@ in@@ dable &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / d@@ l received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function . the AP@@ EX study evaluated the effectiveness of 40 patients with kidney function .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary host point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 times daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x per day ) were achieved . &quot;
there was no clin@@ ically significant significant differences in the percentage of ser@@ um har@@ n@@ re@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation with Pro@@ ban@@ den , regardless their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney function ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serv@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ ac@@ creditation con@@ centr@@ ations ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ E and F@@ act study ) had a ser@@ um harm@@ ac@@ creditation of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l .
&quot; the data collected in two years of open en@@ dur@@ ations study period 3 showed that the continued lowering of the ser@@ um intake levels on &lt; 6 mg / d@@ l ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) yiel@@ ded a decrease in the incidence of gyp@@ sum cases , so that less than 3 % of patients required in the months of 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. over 97 % of the patients required no treatment against a g@@ lim@@ b ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction of the poison@@ ing size , which in 54 % of patients had a complete disappearance of the g@@ allo@@ wan@@ ces by month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients showing a long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate ( 5.2 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open @-@ time extensions ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in healthy volunteers the maximum plasma @-@ concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the plasma @-@ centric time curve ( AU@@ C ) by F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate according to administration easier and multi @-@ pler doses from 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportionate .
doses observed between 120 mg and 300 mg is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate a rise in AU@@ C to be larger than the dose @-@ dis@@ proportionate increase .
after taking easier or multiple doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ max is about 2.@@ 8 @-@ 3.@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml .
&quot; however , there has been no clin@@ ically significant change observed in percentage of ser@@ um har@@ n@@ re@@ con@@ centric , provided this has been tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ SS / F ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate is in the range of 29 to 75 l after intake of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plastic connection of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary bond to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is consistent across the concentration width that is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
&quot; in vit@@ ro studies on human liver micro@@ som@@ ing showed that these oxid@@ ative met@@ res@@ isting are predominantly made by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ eh@@ cur@@ on@@ ide is mainly created by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as imm@@ utable F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate ( 3 % ) , its well @-@ oxid@@ ative met@@ ron@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and a further unknown metast@@ ases ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of urine also approximately 45 % of the dose was found in the chair as imm@@ utable F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate ( 12 % ) , its well @-@ oxid@@ ative met@@ ron@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as a further unknown metast@@ ases ( 7 % ) . &quot;
special patient @-@ groups ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After the intake of multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency changed the C@@ max of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at not in proportion to Pro@@ ban@@ den with normal kidney function . &quot;
the middle @-@ total AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate rose by about the 1.8 @-@ fold of 7.5 μ @-@ h / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ @-@ h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .

these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ li@@ fication and ur@@ in@@ ability and for the clinical use as non @-@ relevant .
it has been found that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day does not affect the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
&quot; at high doses , which occurs approximately at the 4,@@ 3@@ - times of human therapeutic exposure , maternal toxicity came along with a reduction in capacity performance and a development delay in the descendants of rats . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disorder in which the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ opause in which there is a risk for a low vitamin D mirror .
&quot; the patient must take tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and vitamin C ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid a irritation of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may not lay down until after the first food intake of the day , at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and Vitamin D@@ 3 are already separated from each other in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company laid data from earlier studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also led a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to detect the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase in vitamin D mirror .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with the patients who had been treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than those who took exclusively Al@@ en@@ dr@@ at ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also laid data on how to set the dose which in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE contained in the dose is exactly the dose which is needed for preventing a bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headaches , pain of muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscle , bone or joints ) and symptoms of digestive organs such as stomach ache , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gie ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , ul@@ cers ( diar@@ rhea ) , ul@@ cer ( diar@@ rhea ) , sau@@ cers ( pu@@ zz@@ led tum@@ my ) as well as acid re@@ bu@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; in patients with scales hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or one of the other components may not be applied in the AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in conditions of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ a@@ emia ( low size mirror ) or in patients who cannot stand upright or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , beverage or inclusion of drugs ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and vitamin C ) for the day . &quot;
these notes are exactly to be followed to reduce the risk of det@@ achment and connected side effects ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed by the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not cr@@ ush the tablet or the tablet in the mouth , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a exists . • The patients should not lay before the first food intake of the day , at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;

&quot; the doctor should therefore alert to all signs and symptoms to point out the response to potential m@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out , in the appearance of symptoms op@@ pressive irritation like dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gie , pain when dro@@ pping or new or herself worsen@@ ing the medicine ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of grave @-@ risk @-@ side effects seems to be increased in patients , who do not take the medicine properly and , or after the occurrence of symptoms that indicate to a solution @-@ ha@@ ired irritation . &quot;
it is important that all teachers will be passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .

the clinical evaluation by the prescri@@ bing doctor is author@@ itative work in each patient basis on the basis of an individual benefits risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted that they should take the tablet next morning during the failure of taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after having noticed their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets on the same day , but taking the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the week@@ day . &quot;
other diseases which imp@@ air the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated before starting the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE likewise .
&quot; Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da and some or@@ ale medicines may affect the Res@@ or@@ ption of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients must wait after the intake of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ at at least 30 minutes before they use other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific Inter@@ actions studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken together in clinical studies with a variety of usually prescribed medicines without being clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not used either during pregnancy or breastfeeding women .

&quot; Ad@@ vag@@ raf is administered for adult patients , a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent a rep@@ uted of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system . &quot;
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft have already been deployed in the EU , the company has submitted the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical trial in 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation were submitted , with the application of Ad@@ vag@@ f compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ tation was calculated after a treatment duration of one year ( by example examined how often a renewed organ transp@@ l@@ ant or a resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
&quot; furthermore , more recent studies on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients were carried out with liver transp@@ l@@ ant and examined how Ad@@ vag@@ f is taken compared to pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft from the body . &quot;

&quot; only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy and the treatment of transp@@ l@@ ant patients , should this drug prescri@@ be or make changes in immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us this can lead to transp@@ l@@ umps or to an increased incidence of side @-@ effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ om@@ ation . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of the formulation or regime should be made only under the eng@@ masch@@ ige inspection of one in the transp@@ l@@ ant experienced physician ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; in sequence of conversion to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dosage adjustment must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains . &quot;
&quot; the dosage of Ad@@ vag@@ raf should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of rep@@ lication and toler@@ ability , in the individual case and on blood levels ( see below &quot; &quot; Recommen@@ dations &quot; &quot; ( see below ) &quot;
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f at Ad@@ vag@@ raf should be controlled the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley levels before the conversion and over two weeks after switching .
&quot; on day 4 , the systemic exposure was measured as a talent , with both form@@ ulations , both in kidney and in@@ ber@@ transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated controls of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Ad@@ vag@@ ant to ensure proper substance exposure in the direct post @-@ transplan@@ tation phase .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with a low Clear@@ ance , an adjustment of the vaginal dosage can last several days until the Ste@@ ady State is achieved . &quot;
&quot; if the condition of the patient in the first post@@ operative phase is not allowed to take drugs , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrations to produce an in@@ fusion solution ) are introduced with a dose of approx . &quot;
&quot; duration of the application Z@@ ur repression of the transplan@@ tation , the immune system must be sustained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of the transplan@@ tation Pro@@ prophy@@ la@@ xis The or@@ ale Ad@@ vag@@ raf @-@ therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
other Dos@@ is@@ ations can be later required as the pharmaceutical ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after transp@@ l@@ ant .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of the transplan@@ tation Pro@@ vaginal therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommended - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f at Ad@@ vag@@ raf must be made of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules on a once daily intake of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules upon a once daily intake of Ad@@ vag@@ f , so this change in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the whole daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transp@@ l@@ ant After a switch from other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants on eag@@ les once daily must start treatment with each in kidney and liver transp@@ l@@ ant initi@@ al@@ osis for prophy@@ la@@ xis of transp@@ l@@ ulation .
&quot; cardi@@ ac l@@ ant For adult patients , which are provided on eag@@ les , is a oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day daily in the morning . &quot;
other transp@@ l@@ ant receiver does not provide clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ f at lung cancer and col@@ lateral transplan@@ ted patients in a oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.@@ 10 mg / kg / day and in intestinal transplan@@ ts in a oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adap@@ tations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function Z@@ ur maintaining blood @-@ tal@@ kers in the targeted area can be necessary in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions a reduction in the dose .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function As the ren@@ al function is no influence on the pharmaceutical co@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required . &quot;
&quot; due to ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ um kre@@ p@@ umping bar , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
conversion from Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to ad@@ vaginal when switching from a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on a tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the bottom level in full blood The dose should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of rep@@ lication and toler@@ ability in the case of the inf@@ ant of full blood @-@ gra@@ vit@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ ro@@ lim@@ us controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us talent during the first two weeks after transp@@ l@@ ant followed by perio@@ dic checks during the maintenance therapy .
&quot; blood @-@ talent of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be insp@@ ected after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f at Ad@@ vag@@ ware , Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tion , changes of immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or while applying substances that could alter the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us full bleeding ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as Ad@@ vag@@ raf is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments in the dose may need several days until the ste@@ ady state has entered . &quot;
the information in clinical trials allow for successful treatment in most cases is possible when the talent levels in the blood will not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice the talent of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us lies in full blood in the first time after liver transp@@ l@@ ations usually within the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and sha@@ ved - and sav@@ oured patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; during the subsequent treatment of liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac l@@ umps were generally used in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to severe undes@@ irable events , including transplan@@ ts or other side effects which can occur in a result of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of the formulation or regime should be made only under the eng@@ masch@@ ige inspection of one in the transp@@ l@@ ant experienced physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; 5 Z@@ ur treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ tation , which proved to be treated to other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants as therap@@ ists , are still no clinical data for the retar@@ ded wording . &quot;
to prophy@@ la@@ xis of the transplan@@ ts for adult cardi@@ ac transplan@@ ts and transp@@ l@@ ors in the chin @-@ age do not have a clinical data for the retar@@ ded wording Ad@@ vag@@ f .
&quot; due to possible interactions , which can lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ bic levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) , or other herbal medicines to avoid per@@ for@@ atum ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea is a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentrations in the blood necessary as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels in such circumstances can be subject to significant fluctu@@ ations .
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f a Lyme cardi@@ ac disease has been referred to as a cardi@@ ac disease or Sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ trop@@ hia , which can therefore also occur under Ad@@ vag@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such sound@@ ing disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , hypertension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , fluid over@@ load and wast@@ age . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants , the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted to the possible risk of sunlight or ultra@@ violet light due to the possible risk or use of a solar protection by means of a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; when patients have taken the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for pris@@ ings such as headaches , changed awareness of consciousness , cro@@ ws and visual dys@@ functions should be a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.g. &quot;
&quot; because Ad@@ vag@@ f carbide capsules , retar@@ ded , l@@ act@@ ose included , is available in patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ tary Gal@@ act@@ ose intolerance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption special caution . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of drugs or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or in@@ duction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus reduce the blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore advised to super@@ v@@ ise the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels with the same gift of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism , and to adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain equal concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a highly distinctive interaction with an@@ tim@@ y@@ k@@ oti@@ ka such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ol , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ol , as well as the Macro@@ lid antibiotic di@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV @-@ Prot@@ eas@@ ants ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; pharmaceutical studies seized that the increase in blood levels mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , caused by the im@@ itation of the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal combination . &quot;
&quot; Hoch@@ do@@ si@@ fied Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as used in acute const@@ ancy actions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood . &quot;
&quot; effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; therefore , the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with drugs , which are metabo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , whose metabolism is imp@@ aired . &quot;
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us down the clearing of ster@@ oid @-@ contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills and thus increase the hormone exposure , decisions about receptive measures are particularly cautious when making decisions about receptive action . &quot;
&quot; the results of animal trials have shown that tac@@ it lim@@ us can reduce the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one , and extend its half @-@ time . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants , the results of a small number of research on transplan@@ tation patients will not provide an increased risk of unwanted events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; at uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the newborn to potential harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
&quot; it consists of risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a Hyper@@ k@@ ali@@ a@@ emia of the newborn ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the low @-@ effective profile of immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants can often be found precisely because of the under@@ growth of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; below are the side effects listed after their frequency in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not invaluable ) . &quot;

cases of B@@ K @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ associated multi@@ fo@@ tic leu@@ co@@ encephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy including therapy with Ad@@ vag@@ ware .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or mal@@ ignant Ne@@ oplas@@ tics including EB@@ V@@ - Associ@@ ated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ours in connection with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and the high level of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; active mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on molecular level should be conve@@ yed the effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us by its attachment to an cy@@ tos@@ ol protein ( F@@ K@@ B@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the en@@ rich@@ ment of the connection in the cell . &quot;

Adv@@ ate is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a due to the lack of factor VIII conditioned , inn@@ ate blood cell disorder ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of application depend on whether they are advoc@@ ating for the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency that causes blood @-@ inner problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced by a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a cell , into which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced , which has been used to form the human scent factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate is similar to any other approved medicines called re@@ fr@@ ate , similar , but is produced differently , so that the medicine does not contain proteins or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was examined for prevention of bleeding and in surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of Adv@@ ent in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ t@@ sep@@ tic was evaluated with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; well &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headaches , Py@@ re@@ xie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ent may not be applied in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human scent factor VIII , Maus@@ - or ham@@ ster@@ protein or any of the other components . &quot;
March 2004 the European Commission issued the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG to approve the implementation of Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of substitution therapy depends on the severity of the factor VIII @-@ scar@@ city after the place and the extent of the blood and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following mor@@ phic events the factor VIII is to sink in the corresponding period not under the specified plasma levels ( in % of the norm or in that time / d@@ l ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impairment are removed .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat the risk for the patient .
&quot; during the treatment process , it is required to control the dose and frequency of injections , appropriate identification of the factor VIII sculpture level . &quot;
individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII to reach different in vi@@ vo recovery and show different half @-@ times .
3 Pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis Z@@ ur @-@ long @-@ term prophy@@ la@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given by factor VIII per kg body weight in the distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII is not yet achieved , or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed to em@@ ulate an In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so other therapeutic measures have to be weigh@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the speed of payments should be directed after the patient &apos;s payment , whereby the maximum inj@@ ecting rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alised antibodies against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ long@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII tom@@ an immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins that are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; the risk of inhibit@@ ors to develop , cor@@ related with the scale of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 out@@ position stage is most important and dependent on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ sch @-@ known inhibit@@ or development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product was observed to another , the recur@@ r@@ ence of ( lower ) in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of the ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A among women , there are no experiences regarding the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; in the greatest number of patients with inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , all patients have previously untreated patients who have a higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , headaches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( each 3 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , very rare ( incidence based on the available data is not invaluable ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated by the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) C@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ operative day ) in a patient with continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE In@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor of V@@ II@@ I@@ - Spiegel in plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th post@@ operative day .

in addition none of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years old and diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII &lt; 2 % ) after prior exposure to factor of V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentrations ( ≥ 50 days ) an F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or observed .
&quot; in previously not treated patients of an ongoing clinical study , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE patients treated In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors against factor VIII . &quot;
the immune response of patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by the study of antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend , as well as an ongoing peak of the anti@@ body @-@ mirror against anti @-@ CH@@ O cellular proteins , otherwise they occurred no signs or symptoms indicated on an allergic reaction or over@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; four patients were isolated across the occurrence of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash , and increased number of os@@ in@@ ophil@@ es Gran@@ u@@ lo@@ tes in several repeated product positions within the study . &quot;
&quot; 7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE was reported about hyper@@ sensitive type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ act@@ ating reactions ( frequency not known ) . &quot;

&quot; December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited , the Committee on Human@@ itarian Pharmac@@ eutical Research ( CH@@ MP ) officially distributed , that the company assumes its application for approval from advoc@@ acy for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer . &quot;
&quot; however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the past@@ ure parts ( tissues that connect other structures in the body , surrounds and supports ) . &quot;
&quot; this is a type of virus , genetically modified , that it can be a gene in the cells of the body . &quot;
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; , &quot; which was changed so that there can be no copies of themselves and thus no infections in humans can trigger . &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ours and thus allow cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein that is made out of the not broken in the human body existing p@@ 53 @-@ gene , usually contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , where the p@@ 53 @-@ gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the can@@ cer@@ ous cells may continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company recorded data from a study with a patient , at the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer in the area of the sub @-@ building , entered into the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP reviewed the answers of the company on the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ solved . &quot;
&quot; based on the examination of the initial documents , the CH@@ MP is issued on day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP opinion , not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore offers benefits to the patient . &quot;
&quot; the committee also concerns concerns relating to the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not proven sufficiently that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
&quot; the company employed the CH@@ MP not from knowing whether the withdrawal of consequences for patients has , currently participating in clinical trials , or &quot; Com@@ ic Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in . &quot;
&quot; changing substance criminal record &quot; means that the tablets are combined so that one of the effective components is immediately released , and the other is slowly released over a few hours . &quot;
aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever caused by an allergy to pol@@ len ( mu@@ zzle nose ) in patients with nas@@ al nose skin .
in adults and young people aged 12 and older the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food .
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ex@@ termin@@ ated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nose @-@ loop ( mu@@ op@@ ed nose ) . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be retri@@ eved for con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main factors were the changes in the severity of the ha@@ y fever that were reported by the patient before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients received their symptoms every 12 hours into a diary and evaluated with a standard ala , how hard the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in consideration of all hypo@@ cris@@ y symptoms , besides the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose related the patients , the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze assumed , about a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.@@ 0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients , the pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nose @-@ loop was seen , the patients under aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed up a allevi@@ ation of symptoms by 31.@@ 7 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who were des@@ ti@@ ghtness in alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ effects of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze ( observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are T@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ die ( cardi@@ tis ) , mouth , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( pneum@@ atic ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze may not be applied in patients , who may possibly exceed ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or any of the other ingredients , against in@@ ep@@ tive substances or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) are not applied . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in patients who suffer from Eng@@ age @-@ glau@@ coma ( increased water pressure ) , cardi@@ ac or vas@@ cular disease , including hyper@@ ton@@ ic ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ osis ( super@@ blood pressure ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ osis ( super@@ blood pressure ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ osis ( caused by brain blood vessels ) or have a risk for a here@@ tic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued the SP Europe for approval for the transaction of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is to swal@@ low it ( i.e. without breaking down , to break or ch@@ ew ) . &quot;
aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to mis@@ conception and efficacy .
the duration of the application is to keep as short as possible and should not be continued after the end of the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the use of time to 10 days due to long @-@ term application the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in time .
&quot; after the decline in the swelling of the mu@@ cos@@ as in the upper air@@ ways , the treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy when needed . &quot;
&quot; with Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within 2 weeks after completing such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tic activity with combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ls , per@@ go@@ lid , eg@@ ot@@ olin , aqu@@ atic olin , al@@ arms or nas@@ al , eph@@ ric met@@ at@@ rop@@ ine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ ac@@ olin , n@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy have not been tested for this patient collective and the data are not enough to give appropriate recommendations to the dosage .
the safety and effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data are not sufficient to pronoun@@ ce relevant recommendations .
&quot; patients must be informed about that treatment at the occurrence of a hyper@@ ton@@ ie or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , or mis@@ lead , cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea or any other neurological symptoms ( such as headaches or any strengthening of headaches ) must be set . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of following patients groups , patients under D@@ IG@@ ITA@@ L@@ IS • patients with cardi@@ ac disorders - patients with cardi@@ ac disorders in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ologically tests since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka otherwise prevent positive reactions on indicators for building actions or reduce their scale .
&quot; in the context of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol was additionally administered , however , there were no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests could not be noticed any significant differences between those treated with des@@ ti@@ ghtness in and the patients treated with placebo regardless of whether or not alcohol consumed alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabol@@ ites of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzyme has not been identified so that interactions with other medicines can not be excluded completely .
des@@ ti@@ at@@ ad@@ in inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; the in@@ conceivable of the application of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies will not increase frequency of abnorm@@ alities relative to the frequency of the normal population . &quot;
as the reproductive studies of animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ ic properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in should not be applied for aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze in pregnancy .
&quot; however , patients should be elu@@ ci@@ dated about it that in very rare cases it can come to a di@@ zz@@ iness that may lead to impairment of traffic noise or ability to treat machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a Z@@ NS depression ( se@@ dation , Ap@@ no@@ e , reduced mental attention , Cypri@@ an@@ ose , coma , coron@@ ary heart collapse ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor @-@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ins . &quot;

&quot; a Z@@ NS stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as A@@ trop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth@@ drying , p@@ up@@ ill@@ en@@ rigid , and - di@@ lat@@ ation , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the release of the release of pro@@ posi@@ tional cylin@@ dri@@ cal cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the im@@ itation of the expression of the no@@ hem@@ at@@ ol@@ ec@@ l P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ per cells . &quot;
&quot; at a single dose study with adults , des@@ ti@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg has no effect on standard measurement sizes , including the strengthening of subjective neg@@ ligence or the tasks that are connected to the flies . &quot;
controlled clinical trials were found at recommended Dos@@ age of 5 mg daily no increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ ess compared to placebo .
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of a Z@@ NS arousal . &quot;
&quot; it took 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , whereby 4@@ 14 patients received aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ am@@ in@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the overall cor@@ es for the symptom ( except nose @-@ skin swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the sul@@ try effect is determined by the nose @-@ loop surface was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic affili@@ ation groups . &quot;
as part of a single dose of the pharmaceutical study on the Phar@@ mo@@ vi@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of the administration in the plasma .

&quot; in the context of a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study , which was conducted with the formulation as the tablet to healthy adult proportions , was found that four Pro@@ ban@@ e@@ at@@ ad@@ in was badly affected . &quot;
&quot; a component review indicates that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) by pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , in accordance with the all@@ ot@@ ment of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in bio@@ equivalent was the exposure to a aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze tablet . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on security sp@@ amm@@ ers , for toxicity in repeat@@ ed@@ enti@@ ic@@ ity , the pre@@ clinical data can be detected with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in however no special dangers for the human being . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxicity than their individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine . &quot;
in reproductive @-@ production studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and to rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day non ter@@ ato@@ genic .

for children aged one to five years the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup b@@ z@@ w .
&quot; for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup b@@ z@@ w . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight trials with about 4 800 adults and young people with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies in seasonal Rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
&quot; the effectiveness was measured by using the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the p@@ add@@ les , impairment of sleep and the performance in the day ) before and after six weeks before . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been presented to prove that the body sy@@ rup the sy@@ rup , the solution to taking and the melting pot in the same way , as the tablets and the application in children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two weekly treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us became an average decrease of the symptom ( symptom score ) by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two trials in Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the withdrawal of the symptom was after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % compared with placebo treated patients . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied in patients who may possibly exceed ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in or any of the other components . &quot;
January 2001 the European Commission issued a licence for launching of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
&quot; one tablet daily , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and pers@@ istence allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience from clinical studies on the effectiveness of the application of disaster at@@ balls in young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be completed according to the previous illness . it may end after the end of symptoms and can be resum@@ ed in their re@@ acts .
&quot; in the pers@@ isting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( incidence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) , patients may be recommended during aller@@ genic treatment . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets when Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in addition have been administered ( see below Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study the intake of alcohol and alcohol was not reinforced by alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; however , patients should be elu@@ ci@@ dated about it that in very rare cases it can come to di@@ zz@@ iness that may lead to impairment of traffic noise or ability to treat machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ tik@@ aria , were reported in recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , when in patients those were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ effects which was reported more common than placebo , fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth@@ drying ( 0,@@ 8 % ) and headaches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
in a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 young patients aged 12 to 17 years ago the most common side @-@ effect headaches in patients were treated with 5.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and 6.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with placebo .
&quot; in a multi @-@ professional study , administered up to 45 mg of compensation in ( ninete@@ en @-@ time clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the release of the release of pro@@ posi@@ tional cylin@@ dri@@ cal cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the im@@ itation of the expression of the no@@ hem@@ at@@ ol@@ ec@@ l P @-@ sel@@ ect@@ i on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ al@@ cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study involving multiple users , in the disaster in a dosage administered up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine of the clinical dose ) was administered for over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; at a single dose @-@ time study with adults , des@@ ti@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg has no influence on standard measurement sizes , including the strengthening of subjective neg@@ ligence or the tasks linked to flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching flow and redness of the eyes and it@@ ching of the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can be divided into dependence on the duration of symptoms , alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and pers@@ isting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks .
pers@@ isting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as incidence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks .
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall cor@@ es of the questionnaire for the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ kon@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic pri@@ tik@@ aria was investigated as the underlying path@@ physiological chron@@ ology in spite of the etheric path@@ ology in the different forms and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited more easily .
&quot; as the history of history is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular diseases , it is expected that disaster results in other forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria also leads to an improvement of symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ tik@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effective in improving pre@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of p@@ add@@ ling at the end of the first tin intervals .
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka , in chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ tik@@ aria , the minority of patients , who were not being re@@ acted to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka , from the trial . &quot;
an improvement of the ju@@ cket by more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients treated with des@@ ti@@ at@@ to treated patients compared to 19 % of the patients treated with placebo .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of the sleep and the wa@@ its , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate this variable . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmaceutical study , in which the patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s in population , with 4 % of patients received a higher concentration of des@@ trucks . &quot;
there are no clue to a clin@@ ically relevant stat@@ ure after a daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
&quot; however , for the metabol@@ ites of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsi@@ bles , however , it has not been identified so that interactions with other medicines will not be excluded completely . &quot;
des@@ ti@@ at@@ ad@@ in inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in a dosage of 7.5 mg active meals ( fatty acid rich breakfast ) not on the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
the clinical studies carried out with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in pre@@ clinical studies showed a comparable degree of exposure to des@@ ti@@ ghtness in no quality or quanti@@ t@@ ative differences in terms of the toxicity of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and by Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
&quot; based on conventional studies on security resistance , toxicity , toxicity and reproductive @-@ production , pre@@ clinical data can be seen with des@@ ti@@ ghtness in no particular threat to human beings . &quot;
&quot; colorful film ( includes L@@ act@@ ose @-@ mon@@ oh@@ ydr@@ at , Hy@@ go@@ car@@ min , Macro@@ go@@ car@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , color@@ less film ( contains Hy@@ prom@@ o , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , Car@@ nau@@ ba@@ de , of light wax . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of the meals to allevi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and pers@@ istence allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see below Section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s are caused by infection in children under 2 years ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) and that no data is available which support a treatment of inf@@ ective rhet@@ oric with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ alies , in diagnosis the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and corresponding laboratory studies should play a role in diagnosis . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between the ages of 2 and 11 are metabo@@ li@@ zed and experienced a higher sub@@ stan@@ z@@ ant ( see under section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years , which are restricted to metabolic , is identical to the children who are normally metabolic . &quot;
&quot; this medicine includes Sac@@ char@@ ose and Sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients should not take with inherited problems of a fru@@ ct@@ ose intolerance , glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose in@@ suffici@@ ency or su@@ in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with as@@ eri@@ us tablets were not observed when Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol was additionally administered ( see below Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study the intake of ast@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol has not been reinforced by alcohol ( see below Section 5.1 ) .
the overall prevalence of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group like the placebo group .
&quot; clinical studies with adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ tik@@ aria , were reported in recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , when in patients those were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ professional study of adults and adolescents , administered up to 45 mg of compensation in ( ninete@@ en @-@ time clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; children aged between 1 and 11 years , who came into question for an anti@@ hist@@ am@@ in@@ therapy , received a daily non@@ lor@@ ry @-@ ind@@ le dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
&quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ tik@@ aria and the profile of des@@ trucks are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults can be extr@@ ap@@ pered with the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple users of adults and juven@@ iles , in a dose of up to 20 mg daily , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ac effect was described in a dose of up to 20 mg daily . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study on adults and juven@@ iles , in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ninth of the clinical dose ) has been applied for over ten days at adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls had been extended . &quot;
controlled clinical trials were found at recommended Dos@@ age of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents in no increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ ess compared to placebo .
&quot; with a single @-@ daily dose of 7.5 mg A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and young adults in clinical trials , no impairment of psych@@ omot@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies on adults , it was not com@@ promised by the simultaneous intake of alcohol neither to a strengthening of alcohol @-@ induc@@ ed performance and an increase in the sle@@ ep@@ iness . &quot;
&quot; for adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching flow and redness of the eyes and it@@ ching of the palate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall cor@@ es of the questionnaire for the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ kon@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis , less@@ ening A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ tik@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effective in improving pre@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of p@@ add@@ ling at the end of the first tin intervals .
&quot; the spread of this limited metabolic rate was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sians ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; similar pharmac@@ o@@ oc@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ up@@ form@@ ulations of children between the ages of 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which can be restricted . &quot;
the burden ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was about 3 to 6 hours higher and the C@@ max was about 3 to 4@@ times higher with a tempor@@ al half @-@ time distance of approximately 120 hours .
there are no clue to a clin@@ ically relevant ingredient in grief after a daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days at adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies prove that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults who received dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
&quot; however , for the metabol@@ ites of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsi@@ bles , however , it has not been identified so that interactions with other medicines can not be excluded completely . &quot;

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. is officially distributed by the Committee for Human@@ itarian Pharmac@@ eutical Research ( CH@@ MP ) officially on the approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied in adults and elderly people for the protection against flu that is caused by the trunk ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the In@@ flu@@ enza @-@ A virus .
&quot; this is a special type of vaccine administered in front of a trunk of the flu @-@ virus , which might cause a future pan@@ demic . &quot;
&quot; flu pan@@ demic breaks out , when a new strain of influenza virus emerging , which can easily spread from person to person , because people have not built immunity ( no protection ) on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the parts of the flu @-@ virus as &quot; &quot; body alien &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; by doing so , the immune system will be able to form a contact with an influenza virus of this gene@@ alo@@ gical anti@@ body . &quot;
&quot; afterwards the membran@@ es of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the surface of the surface , which recognizes the human body as a body alien ) , and used as a part of the vaccine . &quot;
a inspection of some of the study centers showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; by doing so , the volume of clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine is not sufficient to fulfill the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pan@@ demic vaccines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical examination and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you want more information about the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; it is applied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ ode@@ ficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which caused the acquired immun@@ ode@@ ficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who can not swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ acy will be taken as a solution for one , but this cannot be taken together with chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the safety of this combination has not been investigated . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ acy should only then be prescribed if the doctor has checked , which has taken anti @-@ viral medicines the patient previously , and the likelihood is that the virus is going to address the drug . &quot;
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily which are taken together with twice a day 100 mg of chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg the recommended dose of a@@ eg@@ ase is based on body weight .
A@@ gener@@ ase is reducing the HIV amount in blood while taking a low level in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines .
&quot; AIDS cannot cure AIDS , however , can delay the immune system &apos;s immunity and therefore also delay the development of associated infections and illnesses . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , which previously did not have been treated with prot@@ eas@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; this with low do@@ si@@ len@@ i@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medication A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with 20@@ 6 adults , who had previously taken prot@@ eas@@ ants , with other protein concentrations . &quot;
main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with un@@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change of the virus last after treatment .
&quot; in studies with patients previously not taken any prot@@ eas@@ ants , had more patients a viral last under 400 copies of ml than under placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the Vir@@ us@@ last but from the children who had been treated earlier with prot@@ eas@@ ants , were very few to the treatment . &quot;
in the study involving adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ eas@@ avi@@ r increased medicines A@@ gener@@ ase the Vir@@ us@@ last after 16 @-@ week treatment just as effective as other prot@@ eas@@ ers :
&quot; in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other protein inhibit@@ or , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the virus last after four weeks as with the patients who had previously recorded their previously prot@@ eas@@ ers : &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headaches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , di@@ diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , oc@@ ul@@ ency ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , vom@@ iting , rash and FA@@ gue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied in patients who may possibly exceed ( allergic ) against am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r or any other components .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is also not allowed to be applied in patients , the cur@@ ran@@ ts ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines which are just as gases and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood health diet . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines to HIV , in patients , the A@@ gener@@ ase is taking the risk of a Li@@ b@@ yp@@ ph@@ ie ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( deri@@ ving of bone tissues ) or an immun@@ isation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection that can be caused by the immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ itarian Pharmac@@ eutical Research ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of a@@ generic drugs used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat patients treated with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken along with the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic amplifier , but the committee indicated that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r is taken in combination with chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously been no prot@@ eas@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; as at the time the approval was limited for scientific reasons only limited information . &quot;
October 2000 the European Commission issued the G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited for approval for approval of A@@ gener@@ acy across the European Union .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , prot@@ eas@@ ers ( PI ) @-@ treated adults and children older than 4 years . &quot;
&quot; for usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be administered for pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sts of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r should be taken into account in consideration the individual virus scanner and the treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r as a solution to filing is 14 % lower than of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to inser@@ tion on a milli@@ gram is not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules amounts to 600 mg of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r twice a day together with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying fee of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boobs ) , higher doses need to be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules amounts to 20 mg Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the pharmaceutical , efficacy , effectiveness and safety of a@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other protein subsidies were not investigated in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data about uncertainty and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic data the dose should be reduced to A@@ gener@@ ase capsules with adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction at 450 mg twice daily , and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice a day . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application is to be done with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver disorder , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medicinal drugs , which possess a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ en@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal supplements which contain St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that a@@ eg@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
&quot; the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ generic gases does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot;
&quot; for usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be used together with low doses of chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an anti @-@ viral hepatitis therapy is an elevated risk for heavy liver herbs with potentially fatal course .
for the case of simultaneous anti @-@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant information on this medicine .
patients with existing reduced liver function including chron@@ ically @-@ active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; the simultaneous application of A@@ generic and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glucose levels , is not recommended , unless the possible benefit of a treatment weighs a risk of systemic coron@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oi@@ des effect including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and sup@@ compression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
since the metabolism of the H@@ M@@ G Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or inhibit@@ or heavily dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended for simultaneous appointments with Lov@@ ast@@ ine and Sim@@ vast@@ atin because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen .
&quot; 4 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International norm@@ ality Rati@@ o ) , methods are available for determining the active concentrations . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take these medicines at the same time , a@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r can be the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ on is given simultaneously with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on o@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ent symptoms , especially if there are also low doses can be administered from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the potential risk of toxicity due to the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ col in the A@@ gener@@ acy solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under a age of four and should be applied with caution in certain other patients groups . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be set on duration 5 , if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ cos@@ as are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including Prot@@ eas@@ ants , was reported beyond the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an ex@@ or@@ her@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases to be used to treatment medicines which were associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; B. lo@@ fty age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders associated with it . &quot;
&quot; in h@@ amm@@ ed@@ en patients ( type A and B ) which were treated with prot@@ eas@@ ants , reports are reported on an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous ar@@ omas and hem@@ ost@@ rop@@ es . &quot;
HIV @-@ infected patients with heavy immune def@@ ective can develop an inflammatory reaction to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections that leads to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms .
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial ae@@ ti@@ ology is assumed ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ isation , higher body @-@ measure index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose especially reported in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with small therapeutic width of ap@@ v@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with drugs , which possess a low therapeutic width and furthermore sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ en@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
&quot; C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with small therapeutic width of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be given together with drugs , whose active ingredients are predominantly about C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are linked to the increased Plas@@ ma@@ inst@@ alls with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in resulted in an 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure , and lead to a resource development . &quot;
&quot; when trying to match the reduced plastic levels by a dose of other protein @-@ inhibit@@ ors in combination with chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often unwanted effects were observed at the liver . &quot;
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) The ser@@ um mirror of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r can be degra@@ ded by the simultaneous use of herbal def@@ enses with St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) .
&quot; when a patient takes already cur@@ ran@@ ts , the Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r@@ mirror and , if possible , to check the Vir@@ us@@ last and remove the cur@@ rant . &quot;
a dosage adjustment for one of the medications is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered along with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz below ) .
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max to reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , dos@@ ages of 600 mg Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , showing the effectiveness and in@@ conceivable of this treatment regim@@ atas . &quot;
52 % degra@@ ded if Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg / Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administered .
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were obtained in the combination of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg total times daily ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dose of d@@ osing for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ etra cannot be given , however , a narro@@ wing surveillance is recommended , since the effectiveness and un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there has been no pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the anta@@ sia component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in is recommended that the revenues of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase is at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
therefore at the gift of E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) do not require a dosage adjustment .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz is not recommended in combination with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ equ@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both protein inhibit@@ or would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in on other Prot@@ eas@@ ants and existing limited data can be suspect that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in may be lo@@ wers the ser@@ um kon@@ zentr@@ ation of Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised , because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the decreased or possibly sub@@ therapeutic supplements . &quot;
&quot; when these medicines are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance should be made , since a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to a rise in the plasma con@@ centric ( AU@@ C ) from Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thus to a rise in the rate associated with Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; when it is required for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is administered along with A@@ gener@@ ase , becomes a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although there is no clinical data . &quot;
&quot; pharmaceuticals in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , but the plas@@ modi@@ ties of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
the simultaneous application of twice a day 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ mage avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily led to an increase in the C@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in plasma around 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ partly ) compared to the value which has been observed after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol every day without the simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ mage avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines which are listed below are including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or in@@ duction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are applied together with am@@ algam , possibly lead to interactions . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions which are connected to these medicines if they are used in combination with generic gases .
&quot; based on the data of other Prot@@ eas@@ ants it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da should not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , since it can occur to reset disorders . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of anti @-@ counter medications known as enzyme ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plas@@ modi@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channels like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Fel@@ low@@ pin , Isra@@ eli@@ p@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ di@@ pin , N@@ eck@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il may be increased 10 through am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r thus increasing the activity and toxicity of this medicine . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous ing@@ esting with a@@ gener@@ ase , their plas@@ tic@@ concentrations can increase significantly and strengthen associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
in a clinical study done in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days at Pro@@ ban@@ den have been climbed up to approximately 86 % for@@ ging ( 90 % -@@ con@@ den@@ sor interval 82 to 89 % ) .
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous Gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended together with this Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , unless the possible benefits of a treatment ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ ghs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oi@@ des ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; H@@ M@@ G Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors like Lov@@ ast@@ ine and Sim@@ su@@ vast@@ atin , whose con@@ sol@@ ation is heavily dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , have distinctive elev@@ ations of plasma @-@ levels at the simultaneous administration of a@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; since plas@@ mas@@ on increases of these H@@ M@@ G Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to my@@ opathy , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sis , the combined application of this medicine is not recommended with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; it will be a common monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ ze the mirror , as the plasma @-@ centr@@ ations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased with the same gift of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ acy may not be applied together with oral bi@@ ased mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while at the simultaneous use of a@@ generic Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution is advisable . &quot;
&quot; data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other protein components , indicate a possible increase in the plastic parts of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3@@ - to 4 @-@ fold . &quot;
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ on administered along with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on o@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ent symptoms , especially when also low doses can be administered from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of its very small reliability of historical comparisons , no recommendation cannot be given as the Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose is to be given when Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r is given simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; current offering of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , enhanced monitoring of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ality Rati@@ o ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti @-@ anthrop@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
the effect of an additional administration of chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills is not predic@@ tible as well as alternative methods for contrac@@ eption methods .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side @-@ effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in the current offering of ather@@ ase ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be applied according to careful monitoring of possible use for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk @-@ activ@@ ating rats were detected Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances , but it is not known whether Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r is transferred to men into the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
a reproductive study of pregnant rats that was administered by the n@@ ist@@ ung in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r was given during the lac@@ tation period a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight of the night .
the further development of the ann@@ ul@@ ties including fer@@ til@@ isation and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r to the womb .
the in@@ conceivable of A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in adults and children from 4 years onwards in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most of the side @-@ related effects associated side effects were slightly to moderate , occurred early on and rarely resulted in the treatment of treatment . &quot;
&quot; many of these events have not been clarified , whether in connection with the intake of a@@ eg@@ ase or any other simultaneously to HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the listed side effects come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ eas@@ ants were not pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day . &quot;
&quot; events ( degree 2 to 4 ) , which were employed by the investig@@ ator in connection with the study drug and were performed with more than 1 % of patients , as well as under the treatment performed laboratory changes ( degree 3 to 4 ) are listed . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy has been associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ b@@ ystro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripher@@ al and fa@@ al fatty tissue , hyp@@ ed intra@@ abnormal and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissue , hyp@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ zer@@ ate fat compounds . &quot;
&quot; at 113 anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ ally not pre@@ occupied persons , who were treated with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ u@@ dine / Zi@@ dov@@ u@@ dine on a medium duration of 36 weeks , was only observed one case ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 occurred at 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients under am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 11 % ) with 24@@ 1 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a medium duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
&quot; rash variations were usually slightly to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without itch , and usually disappeared within two weeks , without the treatment with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r had to be abandoned . &quot;
cases of Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disorder or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
HIV @-@ infected patients with heavy immune def@@ ective can develop an inflammatory reaction to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; with PI pre @-@ treated patients , the 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase received twice daily along with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degrees 3 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degrees 3 to 4 ) and CP@@ K values , which in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase together with low do@@ si@@ zable chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in case of an over@@ dose , the patient is on signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) to observe when required , are necessary supportive policies to initiate . &quot;
Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of HIV @-@ 1 protein and thereby prevents the proc@@ ess@@ ation virus and G@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ ous steps with the result of a formation of non @-@ irrit@@ ated viruses .
&quot; anti @-@ viral activity in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ bic cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as in peri@@ ph@@ ate blood@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % genital concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r is in range from 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm in acute cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm in chronic infected cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ recur@@ r@@ ored patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ mage avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages were observed - as with other spro@@ on@@ avi@@ r inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described only rarely observed .
&quot; in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ fit patients , the 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ mage avi@@ r with 100@@ mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r have received twice a day in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure came up until week 48 , with 14 isolation . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otype analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 , with prot@@ eas@@ ants did not encounter pre @-@ treated patients , showed res@@ istent patterns that were similar to those in adults . &quot;

gen@@ otype @-@ based analyses Com@@ otyp@@ ical interpre@@ tations systems may be applied to the ab@@ estim@@ ation of the activity of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with Prot@@ eas@@ ants / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ eas@@ ants and resistant insul@@ ators .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 @-@ algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ mage avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is defined as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , I@@ 87@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M , I@@ 8@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 87@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M , with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced probability of a vi@@ ro@@ logical contact ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to changes through additional data , and it is recommended , always to attract the current interpre@@ tations systems for the analysis of the results of resili@@ ent tests . &quot;
Phen@@ otyp@@ ical analyses @-@ based analyses of Clinical @-@ vali@@ dated phen@@ otype systems may be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otype data for the assessment of the activity of Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with Prot@@ eas@@ ants / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with Prot@@ eas@@ ants / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ eas@@ ants and resistant insul@@ ators .
companies who distribute diagnostic resource tests have clin@@ ically developed clinical @-@ Phen@@ otyp@@ ic Cut @-@ offs ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a resource testing .
&quot; each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ equ@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
there is currently data on the cross @-@ resistance between am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ eas@@ ants for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ mage avi@@ r Res@@ ul@@ pf@@ ade ; either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
&quot; on basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ ties not pre @-@ treated patients , in which a Fos@@ am@@ mage avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , Sa@@ equ@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 insul@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 insul@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; in the other way , Am@@ reg@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other protein @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; obtaining this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isolation . &quot;
the early demo@@ lition of a re@@ medi@@ ating therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits that may affect the following treatment .
&quot; the proof of the effectiveness of a@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily depends on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which with PI pre @-@ treated adults ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , So@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with Low @-@ do@@ si@@ lled Knights &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one hundred thre@@ e@@ fold ( n = 163 ) patients with a wei@@ ghted virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the part study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ allowance of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the So@@ C @-@ PI group in terms of time @-@ ad@@ dictions of output value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the Vir@@ us@@ last ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub@@ marine wave of 0.@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
&quot; the evidence of the effectiveness of un@@ bund@@ led A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 2@@ 88 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 with PI were dealt with . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ gener@@ acy solution was used to take and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice a day . &quot;
there was no low do@@ si@@ pped spro@@ cket at the same time ; the majority of the patients pre @-@ treated patients had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included a plasma @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output value . &quot;
19 Basi@@ cally on this data should be considered in the treatment optimisation of patients with PI @-@ treated children who are being considered to be the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; gases .
&quot; according to oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serv@@ um concentration of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0,5 @-@ 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max was reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease of AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ influenced by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and rate of the Res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume is about 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves to a large distribution volume as well as an enormous penetration of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissues .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the substance in plasma , with the amount of un@@ brid@@ ging Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r that represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ brid@@ ging Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active component during the ste@@ alth state in ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , drugs must indu@@ ce the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or pose a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution may be given when they are given simultaneously with gases ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the offering of A@@ generic capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily routine exposure to 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bi@@ over@@ added as out of the capsules ; therefore A@@ generic solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable to a milli@@ gram .
&quot; also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , hence the effect of a kidney function is likely to be low on the Eli@@ min@@ ation of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r @-@ plas@@ mas@@ h comparable to those that are obtained by healthy promot@@ ers after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous administration of chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on the canal @-@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , with male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne@@ al hep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular v@@ ein ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to people , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r , un@@ spoken . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of hep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ o@@ cular and car@@ cin@@ oma was not yet solved and the relevance of these observed effects for the human being is unclear .
&quot; from the present Ex@@ posi@@ tional data by humans , both from clinical studies and therapeutic use , however , there is little evidence of adopting a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity testing , the bacterial re@@ verse mut@@ ation@@ test test , micro@@ ph@@ ern@@ test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ en@@ ab@@ err@@ ation in human peri@@ ph@@ onic lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was am@@ nesty neither mut@@ agen@@ s nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
these liver @-@ toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life by measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine Ph@@ osph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; until now , in clinical studies , no significant liver toxicity in patients were observed , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase nor by the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies for toxicity in juven@@ iles , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality rate among the control as well as with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in a systemic plastic canal which was significant among ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) as the expected exposure to human dosage , however , a number of minor changes include thy@@ mus or@@ ong@@ ation and mar@@ ginal skel@@ etal changes observed in a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying fee of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boobs ) , higher doses need to be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules amounts to 20 mg Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the simultaneous application is to be done with caution when patients with relap@@ sing or lighter liver disorder , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International norm@@ ality Rati@@ o ) , methods are available for determining the active concentrations . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be set on duration 27 , if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ cos@@ as are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an increased risk of a Li@@ b@@ yp@@ ph@@ ie was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug addic@@ tive factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in resulted in an 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure , and lead to a resource development . &quot;
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max to reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were obtained in the combination of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg total times daily ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dose of d@@ osing for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ etra cannot be given , however , a narro@@ wing surveillance is recommended , since the effectiveness and un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz is not recommended in combination with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ equ@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both protein inhibit@@ or would be low .
&quot; when these medicines are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance should be made , since a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; when it is required for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is administered along with A@@ gener@@ ase , becomes a reduction in the dosage given by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose to 31 , although there is no clinical data . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium streams , such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Fel@@ o@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ low pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ di@@ pin , N@@ mu@@ di@@ pin , and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il may be increased by am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r thus increasing the activity and toxicity of this medicine . &quot;
in a clinical study done in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days at Pro@@ ban@@ den have been climbed up to approximately 86 % for@@ ging ( 90 % -@@ con@@ den@@ sor interval 82 to 89 % ) .
&quot; current offering of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , enhanced monitoring of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ality Rati@@ o ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti @-@ anthrop@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl@@ est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.@@ 0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) led to a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r by 22 % b@@ z@@ w .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be applied according to careful monitoring of possible usage for the mother compared to the possible risks to the fet@@ us . &quot;

&quot; in case of an over@@ dose , the patient is on signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) to observe when required , are necessary supportive policies to initiate . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ viral activity in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ bic cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peri@@ ph@@ ate blood@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % genital concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r is in range from 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm in acute cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm in chronic infected cells ( 1 µm = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; in the other way , Am@@ reg@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other protein @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; obtaining this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isolation . &quot;
&quot; based on this data , the treatment optimisation of patients should be considered to be considered to be considered with PI @-@ treated children of the &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ted &quot; A@@ gener@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ brid@@ ging Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active component during the ste@@ alth state in ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;

the bio@@ availability of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r as a solution to filing is 14 % lower than of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to inser@@ tion on a milli@@ gram is not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .

the simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive inhibit@@ or of the metabol@@ ites of these medicines and may cause severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia .
patients should be advised that a@@ eg@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
&quot; the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ generic gases does not prevent risk 47 to transfer HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot;

&quot; the application of the treatment with Al@@ dara hang on the duration of the treatment with Al@@ dara for up to 16 weeks in the genital area . • For small bas@@ al cell disease , the cream is open six weeks weekly . • In case of small bas@@ al cell cycles , it &apos;s during one or two four @-@ weekly treatment cycles , with four weeks break between the treatment cycles , three times weekly . &quot;
the cream is swal@@ lowed out of the sleeping @-@ skin on the affected skin areas so they have enough for a long time ( about 8 hours ) on the skin before it washed off .
&quot; in all studies Al@@ dara was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dara was tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with waiting in the genital area for 16 weeks . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients treated with full swing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dara was also examined to 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell cancer in two studies where the patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dara or placebo every day or five times weekly .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients with complete waste of tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dara was also tested in two studies on a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ak@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ mos@@ s .
in all studies Al@@ dara was more effective than placebo . • At the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area the complete healing rate in all four main studies ran@@ ged from 66 % to 80 % at the patients treated with Al@@ dara @-@ treated patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dara ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ ot@@ eric , not hyper@@ trop@@ ic ak@@ rot@@ ary ker@@ at@@ ry ( AK@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p with immun@@ ized adults , if the size or number of lesi@@ ons restrict the effectiveness and / or acceptance of cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less appropriate . &quot;
&quot; Monday , Wednesday and Friday , or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday , before bed @-@ bed and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is to continue so long until all visible fe@@ ver@@ ts are disappeared in the genital or peripher@@ al area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
&quot; a break in the process described above should be weigh@@ ed when intensive local inflammation occur ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) , or when a infection is observed in the treatment area . &quot;
&quot; if with follow @-@ up investigation 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the lesi@@ ons treated are only incomplete , should another therapy started ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; when a dose was om@@ itted , the patient would carry the cream if he / she notices it and then continue with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is in a thin layer and in the ger@@ ent , in@@ ating with the ref@@ lies infected skin area , until the cream has been fully drawn . &quot;
it should be carried out at these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with the potential worsen@@ ing of its autoimmune disease .
it should be carried out in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible Organ@@ ic or gra@@ ft @-@ versus reaction .
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily pre @-@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene has been carried out , two cases of severe p@@ hi@@ mos@@ is and a case observed with one to the circumc@@ ision of leading Stri@@ pes . &quot;
an application of I@@ mic@@ qu@@ im@@ od cre@@ ase in higher than the recommended doses is an increased risk for heavy local skin irritation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases were also observed under proper use of severe local skin irritation that have a treatment required and / or have resulted in a temporary physical impairment .
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had trouble passing urine , which required an emergency ca@@ the@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; to apply I@@ mic@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous methods for the treatment of external , genital war@@ ts in the genital and peripher@@ al area , there have been no clinical experience . &quot;
&quot; limited data indicate increased rate reduction for HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mic@@ qu@@ im@@ od cre@@ ase has shown a lower effectiveness in this group of patients . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of alkal@@ ine cancer with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm by the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips or the hair@@ line were not investigated . &quot;
local ho@@ stages are common but the intensity of this reaction takes place generally during therapy or reactions after completion of the treatment with I@@ mic@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
&quot; if it is required due to the discomfort of the patient or due to the severity of local bon@@ ding transactions , a treatment period can be made by several days . &quot;
the clinical result of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; as currently , no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment are available , other suitable therapies should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs do not have clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical study point out that with large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a reduced probability of response to the I@@ mic@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy consists .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of in@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or in the ears or on the lips area within the Li@@ p . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mic@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of in@@ tin@@ ent cor@@ at@@ osis in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and the scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis on the under@@ mine and hands support the effectiveness in this application , so this application is not recommended . &quot;
local ho@@ stages often occur but these reactions usually take back in the course of therapy to intensity or go back after lowering the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
&quot; if local bon@@ ding actions cause great discomfort or very strong , the treatment may be suspended for some days . &quot;
&quot; out of the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 AK@@ - lesi@@ ons are considered a lower complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mic@@ qu@@ im@@ od should be used with caution in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive treatment ( see 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies do not address any direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , the embryonic / federal development , the discharge or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither after one @-@ time nor for multi @-@ dimensional application of quanti@@ fiable ser@@ um mirror ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) , no recommendation to use during the lac@@ tation period can be given . &quot;
the most commonly used and as probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in connection with three times weekly treatment were local reactions at the place of treatment of tor@@ ches ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) .
among the most commonly reported and as probable or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od connection in connection @-@ side effects include complaints on the application site with an incidence of 2@@ 8,@@ 1 % . &quot;
the basis of 185 with I@@ mic@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of phase III reported side @-@ effects are shown below .
&quot; the most common , as probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in connection , were in these studies a reaction to the application location ( 22 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ treated patients ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects which were specified by 25@@ 2 in plac@@ ebo@@ at clinical trials of Phase III with I@@ mic@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with acute allo@@ at@@ osis , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; these pre @-@ tested evaluation of clinical signs shows that it came in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with three times weekly treatment with I@@ mic@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream frequently to local bon@@ ding transactions including Er@@ y@@ them ( 30 % ) , Ex@@ c@@ ori@@ ation / sc@@ rub@@ bing ( 23 % ) and Ö@@ dem ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to exam planned evaluation of the clinical signs shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mic@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream very often too heavy dro@@ y@@ topics ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ sion ( 13 % ) , and to heavy re@@ formation and c@@ rested ( 19 % ) . &quot;
in clinical studies dealing with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of the prostate Ker@@ at@@ mos@@ is was found al@@ pe@@ zie with an incidence of 0.@@ 4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment site or in the surrounding area .
&quot; the accidental @-@ time recording of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headaches , my@@ al@@ gi@@ as and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically wei@@ rd side @-@ effect , resulting in several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ ony that norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic study , according to the top@@ ographic application of I@@ mic@@ qu@@ im@@ od increasing systemic concentrations of the alpha@@ bet and other cy@@ to@@ k@@ ine have been proven . &quot;
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies could be demonstrated that the effectiveness in relation to complete exposure to the genital war@@ ts at an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment can be significantly superior over 16 weeks of placebo treatment .
at 60 % of the total 119 with I@@ mic@@ qu@@ im@@ od therap@@ ists patients were completely absent ; this was at 20 % of the 105 with placebo therap@@ lied patients from the case ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mic@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients compared to 5 % of 16@@ 1 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI )
the effectiveness of I@@ mic@@ qu@@ im@@ od on five @-@ time application per week over 6 weeks was investigated in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; the destinations of tum@@ ours were hist@@ ological confirmed single primary super@@ v@@ entri@@ cle , with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm . &quot;
&quot; the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years present data show that about 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od on three times weekly application in one or two treatment rooms of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week period , treated in two double @-@ flas@@ hes , plac@@ e@@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;

the first @-@ year data from two combined monitoring studies show a recur@@ ren@@ ces after one or two treatment periods a recur@@ ren@@ al rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) .
&quot; the approved indications of external f@@ eig@@ n@@ oses , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis and Super@@ inten@@ tional Bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma are usually not limited to and were therefore not investigated . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dara cream was investigated in four random@@ ized , double @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with m@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um Con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages ( 3@@ x / week for a period of &lt; 16 weeks b@@ z@@ w .
a minimum system intake of the 5 % natural I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream by the skin of 58 patients with ak@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during the three weeks weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest medicine concentrations in the Ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amoun@@ ted to 0,@@ 1 , 0,@@ 2 and 1,6 n@@ g / ml in use in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 single bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 75 mg , 2 bag ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated half @-@ time amount was approximately 10@@ times higher than the 2@@ hours half @-@ time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in a previous study ; this indicates a prolonged retreat of the drug in the skin .
the data to the systemic exposure showed that the Res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low for patients aged 6 to 12 years and comparable to that with healthy adults and adults with ak@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ v@@ entri@@ c cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on the painting toxicity in the rat led doses from 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg to significantly lower body weight and increased milk weight ; a also four months long run @-@ run study resulted in the mouse no similar effects .
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity at mice in the case of mice at three days a week indu@@ ce no tum@@ ors at the application point .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ s , is a risk to man due to the systemic exposure to be very low . &quot;
the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice that was treated with the effective cream earlier and in larger numbers as in the control group with low U@@ VR .

June 2003 the European Commission issued the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. to approve it from Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me across the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mam@@ mal @-@ cell culture ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of Chinese Ham@@ ster ) . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is for long @-@ term enzymes in patients with reliable diagnosis of a Mu@@ kop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ot I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be , if the patient carries this , every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 e / kg / h . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me at adults over 65 years was not determined and for these patients no dosage schedule is recommended .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suffici@@ ency was not determined and for these patients no dosage schedule is recommended .
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients may develop in@@ fusion @-@ conditioned reactions , which are defined as any associated side @-@ effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion , or until the end of the in@@ fusion date ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be monitored remot@@ ely , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made available in an appropriate clinical stage , in the re@@ organisation facilities for medical emergen@@ cies immediately . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that virtually all patients may form Ig@@ G antibodies to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; since little experience in regard to the resum@@ ption of the treatment after a longer break , must be cautious due to the theoretical risk @-@ reaction after a interruption of the treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti @-@ Py@@ th@@ intern@@ ships ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion conditions .
in the event of a slight or medium @-@ resistant reaction method the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and pro@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weigh@@ ed and / or a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to half the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
&quot; in the event of a single , heavy in@@ fusion reaction must be stopped the in@@ fusion until the symptoms are decreased , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is considering . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in in@@ fusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 are ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ am@@ in@@ ox@@ en / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) as well as a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate at which the pres@@ elected response occurred .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; experimental studies do not leave direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns that were exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase via the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended , is recommended during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me not to satisfy . &quot;
the adverse reactions in clinical trials were collected mainly as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients at the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) .
&quot; unwanted drug actions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the Phase 3@@ - study and its extension at a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years , often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper air@@ ways and lungs in the pre @-@ history , there are severe reaction to , including bronze pas@@ mus , breathing still@@ ness and coun@@ tenance ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ solic@@ ited pharmaceutical impacts related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a ph@@ as@@ e- 2 @-@ study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predominantly severe cont@@ estation of treatment and a treatment of treatment up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients , it came within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ ical version , where in the age of 5 with a severe trial period , usually within a month at a ser@@ o@@ con@@ ical version , ( on average after 26 days with patients aged 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; by the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature retirement from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients received no det@@ ectable antibodies before , including 3 patients , with which there was never been Serbian version . &quot;
patients with lack of anti@@ body rejuven@@ ation indicated a robust reduction in the G@@ ag @-@ mirror in the har@@ n while in patients with high antibodies a variable reduction of G@@ ag in Har@@ n was determined .
four patients ( three in the Phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ alized to low neutral inhibit@@ or activity in vit@@ ro that seemed to imp@@ air the clinical effectiveness and / or reduction of G@@ ag in the Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies appeared not to be associated with the incidence of unwanted drug actions , even if the appearance of unwanted drug actions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the reasoning for the enzymes is one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of accumulated sub@@ str@@ ates and the prevention of an additional accumulation of accumulation .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about cre@@ osis @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ or@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me have been investigated in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , plac@@ e@@ controlled phase @-@ 3 study to 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the whole disease spectrum was recorded , the majority of patients from the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient pointed to the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited when they had a for@@ ci@@ ated exp@@ ir@@ atorial volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change to the expected FE@@ V and the absolute walking distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label study study where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients compared to the placebo group improved the lung function and the co@@ gni@@ tion which is shown in the following table .
an open discussion study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and out of 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as out of the following table .
the decrease of the mounting percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically significant over this period of time and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volume increased further propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with a hep@@ at@@ opo@@ lies before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) to the end of the study , a normal liver size . &quot;
within the first 4 weeks a clear decrease of the G@@ ag @-@ mirror in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was established until the end of the study was constant .
&quot; regarding the hetero@@ geneous disease , considered by use of a combined end@@ point , the clin@@ ically significant changes exceeded by using a combined result ( 58 % ) , generally increased in 26 patients ( 22 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year @-@ old open phase @-@ 2 study was conducted in which primarily the safety and phar@@ yn@@ ge@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined at 20 patients at the time of their recording in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe kidney form and 4 with the medium run form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased due to increased GA@@ G@@ - Spiegel in the har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 e / kg .
&quot; in several patients , a scale growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined by the Z @-@ Score for these age group The younger patients with the mid @-@ course form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mid @-@ course form provided a normal mental stage rate , while at least no progress was made in cognitive development . &quot;
&quot; in a Phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ Do@@ atisation schem@@ ata were performed on the G@@ ag @-@ mirror in the resin , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute wal@@ k@@ test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the automation scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be present in patients , the difficulties with weekly inser@@ ts ; however , is not proven that long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two Do@@ atisation schem@@ ata is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available every year , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 years was similar to that in older and less strongly affected patients .
&quot; based on conventional studies on security insur@@ ers , toxicity in one @-@ time gift , toxicity for repeated calls and reproduction rel@@ ic@@ ity , the pre@@ clinical data can not recognize any particular threat to human beings . &quot;
&quot; since no compatibility studies have been carried out , this medicine must not be mixed with other medicines except with the ones listed under 6.@@ 6 . &quot;

if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive to one of the components of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have a severe allergic reaction to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; an in@@ fusion conditional reaction is any side @-@ effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion date ( see section 4 &quot; What side @-@ effects are possible &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you are taking medication , the chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because there is possible risk of dimin@@ ished effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if you have taken other medicines or have recently been taken , including prescription drugs . &quot;
information for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrations to manufacture an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to application and is provided to intraven@@ ous use ( see information for physicians and medical staff ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be if the patient den@@ ies this every 15 minutes gradually increased to a maximum dose of 43 e / kg / h .

preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technology ) • J@@ e after body weight of the individual patient to determine the number of th@@ inner bot@@ tled water bottles .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with Cis@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet been removed any chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) , and &quot; mal@@ ignant &quot; ( mal@@ ignant cancer ) has already spread to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ specific &quot; lung cancer , which is not the plate of epitheli@@ um cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have previously not been treated in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin , and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regim@@ en . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should be taken during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and injections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered along with Cis@@ pl@@ atin , should be given before or after the gift of Cis@@ pl@@ atin in addition to an &quot; anti @-@ e@@ tic &quot; ( drug against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( in order to prevent a liquid deficiency ) . &quot;
&quot; patients whose leu@@ ka@@ emia changes or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be raised up , ab@@ used or the dose should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ to@@ xed requires the formation of DNA and RNA , and prevents the cells to share . &quot;
&quot; the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed to its active form is easier to equi@@ p into cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of drug and cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the mal@@ ignant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oms A@@ lim@@ ta was studied in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients , which had previously not received any chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , which had previously been treated with chemotherapy , compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( a different drug against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) , namely in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin , survived an average of 12,@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the all@@ ot@@ ine administration of Cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients having previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.@@ 3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients in which cancer does not handle the record epitheli@@ um , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival rates than with the comparison of a comparison medicine . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued the El@@ i Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. to withdraw from A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union . &quot;
any diar@@ rho@@ ea bottle must be resolved with 4.@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium hydro@@ chl@@ oride inj@@ ecting ( 9 mg / ml ) - results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ - sis is taken from diar@@ rho@@ ea and with 0.@@ 9 % sodium hydro@@ chl@@ oride inj@@ ecting ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml further dil@@ uted ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is used in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma except in con@@ form@@ ative pl@@ atten@@ epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is shown for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al epitheli@@ al ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes a day each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of Cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² CO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma after previous - gan@@ try chemotherapy is the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; to decrease the frequency and severity of bon@@ ding actions , the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift , as well as the day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid are given . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days prior to the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be taken at least 5 doses , and the intake must be continued during the entire therapy period , and for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients must also obtain an in@@ tra @-@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ gram ) in the week prior to the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after every third payment @-@ cycle @-@ cycle .
&quot; in patients , the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ te received , before every gift , a complete blood @-@ image was created - the , including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a thro@@ mbo@@ lic en@@ umer@@ ation . &quot;
the Al@@ kal@@ ine Ph@@ osph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at @-@ Trans@@ am@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and alan@@ ine @-@ Trans@@ am@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should amount to &lt; 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit .
at the beginning of a new treatment course a dosage adjustment must take place under Ber@@ ück@@ erian activity of the N@@ adi@@ r of blood or of the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity of the forec@@ ast@@ ed therapy cycles .
&quot; after recovery , patients need to be treated according to the information in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute common F@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degrees 2 ha@@ em@@ ung .
&quot; should patients not develop @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be interrupted , until the patient gets the value before the treatment &quot;
the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA has to be termin@@ ated if in patients after 2 dos@@ is@@ tically shiel@@ ds or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity or not @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity or so@@ - continue with the occurrence of degree 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical trials do not notice that in patients aged 65 years or in comparison to patients aged 65 years an increased risk @-@ risk .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to not sufficient data about un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able and efficacy .
in clinical studies were necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance from ≥ 45 ml / min no dosage adap@@ ts that go over for all patients recommended dosage adjustment .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function of the upper lim@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ k and / or trans@@ am@@ in@@ as@@ en@@ values of &gt; the 3.@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in case of liver metastatic colorectal ases ) or &gt; 5.@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( for the presence of liver metastatic bits ) were not specifically studied in the studies . &quot;
patients must be monitored with regard to the Kno@@ wing g@@ ents and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be administered in patients before their absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ular number has again achieved a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ mbo@@ genic number has again achieved a value of ≥ 100 cells / mm ³ .
a dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ular number , thro@@ mbo@@ lic numbers and maxim@@ ally non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles - den ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
a lesser toxicity and a reduction of degree 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ om@@ mat@@ ological toxicity such as ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia and infection with degree 3 / 4 ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia has been be@@ o- and desp@@ ised when a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
&quot; therefore all patients need to be reli@@ ed in patient @-@ treated patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a prophy@@ l@@ actic measure for the reduction of treatment @-@ related toxicity ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium in@@ suffici@@ ency in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous intake of non @-@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ cos@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) like i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ ation ( &gt; 1,3 g per day ) for at least 2 days before the therapy and avoid treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients , intended for treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half @-@ time period , for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred , had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hypertension or Diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a dra@@ inage of the result before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment are to be wo@@ ken . &quot;
&quot; serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dinal , and cervi@@ cal events have been reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally reported when this substance is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous use of ad@@ ored vital substances ( except yellow fever , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of irreversible damage caused by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the treatment - g@@ inn to obtain advice on sperm conservation . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses can cause non @-@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g per day ) to a decreased P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed discharge with the result of a multip@@ ly up @-@ effects of side @-@ effects . &quot;
therefore caution is advisable when patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or Ac@@ e- t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid may be used in high dosage .
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ de@@ - TE@@ NS 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed been avoided ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data is available with regard to the interaction potential , with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , with a long semi @-@ service life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ fec@@ dis@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - fixed . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the scent status during the illness and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ality Rati@@ o ) if the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed with pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - and tim@@ il@@ ol@@ ites are expected to be used during an application in pregnancy severe birth defects . &quot;
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be applied during pregnancy , except if absolutely essential and after careful distr@@ action of the use for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity is made , men should be pointed out before the treatment course of the treatment plan to obtain advice on the sperm count . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into the mother &apos;s milk , and unwanted effects on four infants can not be excluded . &quot;

&quot; the most common side @-@ effects of All@@ i ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are ble@@ aching spots at After , Fl@@ atus ( Win@@ de ) with stu@@ d@@ ging , fa@@ eces , o@@ glob@@ ous s@@ acks ( winds ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( Win@@ de ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it must not be applied in patients who are treated with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent the organ of transplan@@ ts in transplan@@ ts ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ays .
&quot; it may not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption ( with which not sufficient nutrients from the digestive tract ) or in Chol@@ est@@ ase ( a liver disease ) suffer , and in pregnant or breastfeeding mothers . &quot;
July 2007 the European Commission issued G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited to approve the approval of Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K across the European Union .
&quot; it is inde@@ xed to weight reduction of adults with excess weight ( body mass index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be applied in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ cal , fet@@ ched nutrition . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied to children and adolescents under 18 , as not enough data for effectiveness and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , because Or@@ list@@ at is only minimal resor@@ bed , it is necessary in ageing and in patients with reduced liver and / or ren@@ al function , no adjustment of the dosage . &quot;
• Over@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other components • simultaneous treatment with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Chr@@ onic Mal@@ absorption syndrome • chol@@ est@@ ase • pregnancy ( see section 4.6 ) • simultaneous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of tre@@ ati@@ ful gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if alli is taken along with a fat @-@ rich in @-@ life or fat @-@ rich diet .
&quot; as the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by an improved metabolic control , patients should consult a drug against diabetes before starting a therapy with alli a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic should be adapted if necessary . &quot;
patients who use alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or an increased cholesterol level should consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage needs to be adjusted .
&quot; it is recommended to meet additional fluctu@@ ating kill@@ ers measures , in order to prevent this in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea possible failure of the oral contrac@@ eption ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
both in a study on interactions of pharmaceuticals as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of Or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in has been observed a lowering of the Cic@@ los@@ port in plastic .
&quot; when using war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with Or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( international rati@@ o , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients who were treated in clinical studies up to 4 full years with Or@@ list@@ at , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K , and the beta @-@ carot@@ ene inside the standard . &quot;
&quot; however , the patient should be recommended before bed@@ time a supple@@ mentation of the mul@@ tiv@@ itamin supplement to ensure sufficient vitamin ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the gift of a mal@@ dose Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on , a limited number of volunteers have been observed at the same time , a minor decrease of Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
the side effects of Or@@ list@@ at are primarily hospitable and hang together with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented . &quot;
the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg for a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
&quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not invaluable ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of the unknown side @-@ effects which have been established after the launch of Or@@ list@@ at , is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of a certain magnitude . &quot;
† It is plau@@ si@@ bly that treatment with alli can lead to def@@ enses with regard to possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg of Or@@ list@@ at and multi @-@ luggage of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings .
&quot; in the majority of cases reported after market launch , there were either no side effects or similar side effects as in the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on investigations on humans and animals can be traced by a fast rep@@ lication of systemic effect , which can be traced to the li@@ pas@@ sible properties of Or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
the therapeutic effect is set in the lum@@ ens of corn and the upper intest@@ ine by kov@@ al@@ ent bond to the active Ser@@ in @-@ Rest of the ga@@ str@@ ic and Pan@@ cre@@ atic Li@@ pas@@ en .
&quot; clinical studies were derived that 60 mg of Or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , absorption of approximately 25 % of food waste . &quot;
&quot; two doubles , random@@ ized , plac@@ e@@ controlled trials at adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 , the effectiveness of 60 mg of Or@@ list@@ at , taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ cal , fet@@ ched nutrition . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change in the body weight opposite the output value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of course ( table 1 ) and as percentage of those students who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction have been observed over 12 months , the largest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in the total cholester@@ in was 60 mg -@@ 2.2 % ( output value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.@@ 8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; with the wa@@ ist size , the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( output value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.@@ 6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) . &quot;
Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations of not metabo@@ li@@ fied Or@@ list@@ at were not measurable for 8 hours following the oral Gift of 360 mg / list@@ at not measurable ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , with therapeutic dos@@ ages , not metabo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma was only spor@@ adic@@ ally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of a speculation . &quot;

the most common side @-@ effects are associated with the effectiveness of the capsules and thus arise that more fats are ex@@ cre@@ ted out of the body .
&quot; these side effects tend to occur within the first few weeks after the treatment start , as at this time the fatty share in the diet may have not been consistently reduced . &quot;
&quot; with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize the nutritional esc@@ ences : • Beg@@ ins you already a few days , or better a week , prior to the first ing@@ esting the capsules with a fet@@ ched nutrition . • learning more about the usual li@@ posuction of your favourite food and about the size of portions that you normally take . &quot;

&quot; note the further down in this section below tables . • The suggested fet@@ ching intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat , which you should take with every meal . &quot;
&quot; which amount is suitable for you , see the below information that indicates the number of calories which is suitable for you . • Due to the mode of effect the capsule is the observ@@ ance of the recommended fat supply . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat to yourself as previously , this may mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by keeping the recommended fat reduction , you can maximize the weight gain and at the same time dimin@@ ish the probability for nutritional companion . • You should try to decrease progres@@ sively and continuously . &quot;
&quot; 34 This decreased cal@@ orie intake should allow you to gradually lose weight approximately 0,5 kg per week , without losing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments . &quot;

al@@ xi is used for chemotherapy and vom@@ iting the severe trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like Cis@@ pl@@ atin ) and chemotherapy for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi may be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a drug that can be used as an anti @-@ e@@ medication ) .
the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as the effects in this age group does not have enough information available .
&quot; this means that the active ingredient is preventing the bond of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ in ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) , preventing the recept@@ ors in the gut . &quot;
al@@ xi was examined in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults which received chemotherapy regim@@ ens which are severe or moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting .
&quot; chemotherapy in chemotherapy , which are severe trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of the patients who treated with Alo@@ xi were treated in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 132 from 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron patients ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
chemotherapy for nausea and vom@@ iting are reported 81 % of patients who were treated with alo@@ xi in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 153 from 18@@ 9 ) compared to 69 % of patients with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron treated patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( 101 out of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 the European Commission issued the Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd . a permit for the acquisition of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
al@@ xi is inde@@ xed : to prevent acute nausea and vom@@ iting with strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer disease and the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting at moder@@ ated chemotherapy due to cancer disease .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting that induc@@ ed by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be ampli@@ fied by adding one of the Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids .
&quot; as Pal@@ on@@ otic tron can prolong the col@@ der age , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ nesty Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of sub@@ species I@@ le@@ us after the injection of eng@@ ths . &quot;
&quot; however , like with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advisable at the same gift of Pal@@ on@@ osis tron with drugs that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T interval is extended or which tend to such an extension . &quot;
&quot; except in connection with a further chemical psych@@ otherapeu@@ tics , al@@ xi should neither be used in the days following chemotherapy nor for the treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies inhi@@ bited Pal@@ on@@ osis and the tum@@ ors targeted activity of the five examined chemotherapy regim@@ ens not ( Cis@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ in , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose Pal@@ on@@ osis tron and a ste@@ ady stat@@ e- concentration or@@ ical Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , one C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in a population based on a population @-@ based pharmac@@ o@@ e@@ tic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors ( D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ as@@ tics , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ ine , Khomein@@ i , hem@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ ine and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron . &quot;
&quot; experiences for the use of Pal@@ on@@ osis tron for human pregn@@ ancies are not present , therefore Pal@@ on@@ otic tron should not be applied in pregnant , unless it is considered to be deemed necessary by the prescri@@ bing doctor . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ gram to observed side effects ( total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , who were at least possibly with Alo@@ xi in connection , headaches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of over@@ sensitivity and reactions at the destination of destination ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experiences . &quot;
in the group with the highest dosage showed similar frequencies of unwanted events as in the other do@@ zation groups ; there were not a dose of dose @-@ working relationships .
&quot; there have been no di@@ aly@@ sis studies carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy for a Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ized double @-@ blin@@ d@@ studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients , which received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with &lt; 50 mg / m2 C@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 m@@ c@@ g or 750 m@@ c@@ g Pal@@ on@@ osis tron ( half @-@ time 7 hours ) or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 7,@@ 3 hours ) , which was given to Day 1 without D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ized double @-@ blin@@ d@@ study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients , which received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ Cis@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin , as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron received , given to 32 mg On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron , given to Day 1 intraven@@ ously . &quot;
results of the studies with moder@@ ated chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
the effects of chemotherapy induc@@ ed nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were comparable to the effects of Pal@@ on@@ osis tron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron and Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on . &quot;
&quot; according to the findings of Pre@@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ otic tron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular degeneration and re@@ pol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the study conducted by 221 healthy volunteers conducted study was assessing the E@@ KG @-@ effects of i.@@ V. administered from 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg . &quot;
tr@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous gift follows an initial decrease of Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations a slow Eli@@ min@@ ation from the body with average termin@@ ations of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plastic concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally included in the entire tin @-@ area of 0.@@ 3@@ - 90 μ g / kg in gest@@ ures and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous gift from Pal@@ on@@ osis tron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average medium ( ± SD ) rise in the Pal@@ on@@ osis tron Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; from pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations indicate that at once daily intraven@@ ous immun@@ isation of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ osis tron on 3 consecutive days , En@@ tex@@ position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) reached with the value of 0.@@ 75 mg of measured value ; however , the C@@ max after the reproduction of 0.@@ 75 mg was higher . &quot;
about 40 % are eliminated over the kidneys and some more 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites that have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor .
&quot; in @-@ vit@@ ro studies for met@@ res@@ ization have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in lower dimensions , the I@@ so@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 on the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron are involved . &quot;
&quot; elimination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ osis tron , around 80 % of the dose were found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ osis tron is un@@ altered active ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a unique intraven@@ ous error projection in gest@@ ures , the total body is 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ ale Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although patients with severe liver dysfunction is increased the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation period and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ otic tron , a reduction of the dose is however not justified . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies have been observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered adequate above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a small relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 From the clinical studies revealed indications that Pal@@ on@@ osis tron can only block in very high concentrations of I@@ on@@ en@@ can@@ als , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular degeneration and re@@ pol@@ arization and extend the duration of action . &quot;
&quot; high doses Pal@@ on@@ otic tron ( each dose was given in about the 30@@ ths of the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given every day over two years , led to a multip@@ ly frequency of liver tum@@ ours , endo@@ cr@@ ine Ne@@ oplas@@ tics ( in thy@@ roid , pitu@@ itary cord ) and skin tumor in rats , but not with mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the used high doses and since alo@@ xi are determined when people use the unique application , the relevance of these results will be limited to people . &quot;

June 2006 the Committee for Human@@ itarian Pharmac@@ eutical Research ( CH@@ MP ) passed a negative report in which the authorisation of approval for the processing of hepatitis C is recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C in the treatment of al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injections .
this means Al@@ ph@@ eon a biological medicine named Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A is similar to the same phar@@ ma @-@ effective integral part which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; Re@@ ference Manual &quot; ) .
al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ prolonged ) hepatitis C ( one caused by a viral infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic examination the liver tissue indicates damage , besides , the values of the liver enzymes is increased in the blood rate ( AL@@ T ) in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced , which inspir@@ es this to the formation of the substance . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data that occupy the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active ingredients , composition and purity of the drug , effectiveness , security and effectiveness in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
the study of patients with hepatitis C was compared to the effectiveness of Al@@ ph@@ eon with the effectiveness of the reference therapeutic approach to 4@@ 55 patients .
&quot; the study was measured , like many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks , and 6 months after the treatment of treatment to the drug ( i.e. no sign of the virus in blood ) . &quot;
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 e @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is for non business purposes only provided from the E@@ MEA is to prohi@@ bit the approval for the CH@@ MP ?
&quot; in addition , concerns have been utter@@ ed so expressed that the data on the stability of the active ingredient and the drug is not sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients infected with hepatitis C , which spoke to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in the clinical study . &quot;
&quot; after hiring the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease has more than more patients again than with the reference agent ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; aside from that , the test results obtained in the study on how far the drug forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it may be used for the treatment of Im@@ peti@@ go ( one with cr@@ ust formation , associated with skin @-@ infection ) and small infected wor@@ m@@ ations ( cr@@ acking or chi@@ pped ) , amor@@ tis@@ ation and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been demonstr@@ ably or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant for@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ ó may not affect these types of infections .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age , the skin surface should not be over 2 % of the surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient refers not to the treatment after two to three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial cast@@ or ( the parts of bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was carried out in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.@@ 1 % ) of the 71 patients under placebo spoke to the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected Hau@@ tw@@ os , Al@@ tar@@ go and Cef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar coun@@ ties : when the results of both studies were taken together in front of the house , about 90 % of the patients of both groups spoke to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was caused in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( whi@@ ch@@ illed cav@@ ity in the body tissues ) or of infections that have been demonstrated or presumably by MR@@ SA are not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which has been observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irritation at the order of the order .
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ itarian Pharmac@@ eutical Research ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go during short @-@ time treatment of the following superficial skin infections on the risks predomin@@ ate : • Im@@ peti@@ go , • infected small in@@ fir@@ ing , amor@@ tis@@ ation or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission issued the G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for the marketing of Al@@ tar@@ go across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; patients in which no improvement shows within two to three days , should be investigated once and should be considered an alternative therapy ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the case of sensi@@ ti@@ ze or severe local irritation due to the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment shall be broken , the sal@@ ine is thoroughly un@@ certain@@ ed and an adequate alternative treatment of the infection will be begun . &quot;
&quot; Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections , by which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gens or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies in secondary wounds was the effectiveness of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ icillin @-@ resistant for@@ k@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , insufficient . &quot;
alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment no bet@@ tering or a deterioration in the infected place occurs .
the effect of simultaneous application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical resources on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations , which were obtained in humans following topical skin or infected superficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition cannot be expected in vi@@ vo ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 . simultaneous gift of 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the middle ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max to top@@ ographic application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on the cool@@ ed skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
&quot; due to the small systemic , exposure to topical application in patients may not be deemed necessary if topical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin used during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive @-@ visual acu@@ ity after oral intake and are inadequate in terms of a statement on effects on birth and the federal / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
&quot; Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should be applied only during pregnancy , if a topical anti @-@ bacterial therapy is clearly inde@@ xed and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of a systemic antibiotic . &quot;
when deciding whether the breastfeeding has continued or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continues to be termin@@ ated between the benefits of breastfeeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for women .
&quot; in clinical studies to 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was applied , the most commonly reported out@@ effect of irritation at the date of employment , which regarded approximately 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; mode of ret@@ ali@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated through fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the functioning mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective in@@ hibition of bacterial synthesis of bacterial synthesis on interaction with a particular as@@ signing of the 50@@ s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ oms which differs from the ties of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the bin@@ der @-@ site Protein L@@ 3 are involved and in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ rods and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ as@@ e@@ Center .
&quot; due to the relationship at this Bin@@ ding site inhi@@ bit p@@ lights transfer , partly P @-@ binary inter@@ activity and prevent the normal education of active 50@@ s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ inal sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; should be noted on the basis of the local prevalence of resistance to the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin , with at least some infection forms , a consultation should be pursued by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity from Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to S.@@ aur@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the insul@@ ates were delicate or resistant to meth@@ icillin . &quot;
&quot; in case of non @-@ response to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton ) Valentine Fel@@ co@@ ci@@ din should be considered . &quot;
or@@ ption In a study involving healthy adults was placed 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and de@@ ported skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , which received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days to the topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plastics were generated . &quot;
the sampling was done on days 3 or 4 with adult patients each before the medication and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual system inclusion in the people after topical application of 1 % sal@@ be on 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP Hem@@ p . &quot;

&quot; studies for oral toxicity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were conducted over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is applied for the protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases which affect the liver ) in children between one and 15 years that are still not im@@ mu@@ n against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix will be applied within two doses of the vacc@@ inations with a protection against hepatitis B possibly only after administration of the second dose .
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix can only be used if the immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and is ensured that the vaccination program can be brought to an end from two doses . &quot;
if a refres@@ her dose for hepatitis A or B is possible Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given .
&quot; vaccines have an effect by bringing the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , &quot; as it can defend itself against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; and generates antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components approved since 1996 and it has been approved by Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
&quot; the three vaccines are applied to the protection against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children will be administered in a three doses existing vaccine . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adult ingredients were included , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as evidence for the use of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibodies a month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared to a six @-@ month period and a 12 month period between the two injections . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix fought between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the final inj@@ ecting in the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix had at a six @-@ month distance between the injections .
&quot; the most common side @-@ effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccines ) are head@@ ache , loss of appetite , pain at the inj@@ ecting location , redness , redness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may not be applied in patients , who may possibly exceed ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
August 2002 the European Commission issued G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als S.@@ a. for approval for the event of Ambi@@ rix throughout the world
&quot; the standardization plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ in@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vaccines , whereas the initial dose is administered for the first dose between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ hes are desired for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vaccines or with a combination of combination . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibodies are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective mon@@ olith@@ ic vaccines .
&quot; it is not yet completely assured , whether immun@@ ologically competent individuals who have addressed to a disease vaccine as they may need a refres@@ her as protection as they may not be protected by immun@@ ological memory at no longer demonstr@@ able antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all injections , for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the gift of the vaccine appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring are always available immediately . &quot;
&quot; if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardization scheme with the combination of hepatitis B is recommended , the 360 ELISA test form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able hepatitis B surface . &quot;
&quot; in case of her@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis and persons with disorders of the immune system , after the pri@@ mers and anti @-@ h@@ bs anti@@ body is achieved , so that in these cases the gift of other vaccines may be required . &quot;
&quot; as an intra@@ der@@ mal inj@@ ecting or in@@ tra @-@ muscular administration could lead to an almost optimal imp@@ aired success , these injections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; however , in case of thro@@ mbo@@ lic cy@@ top@@ ic@@ ie or blood @-@ related disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected into sub@@ cut@@ aneous , since it may occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration . &quot;
if Ambi@@ rix occurred in the second living year in the form of a separate injection at the same time combined with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us type b vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or combined with a combined mas@@ - m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine was the immune response to all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ ective , it must be assumed that there is no adequate immune response . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study that has been conducted with 3 vacc@@ inations of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , rest@@ ro@@ ent@@ ery , headaches and fever is comparable to the frequency that observed in the earlier Thi@@ ere sal@@ - and preserv@@ atives . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ inated Ambi@@ rix had been administered at a total of 10@@ 27 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years . &quot;
in a study of 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix had been compared to those of the 3 @-@ doses of combination .
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and balance on a comp@@ utation pro forma dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on one calculation basis per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the test subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the pros after the receipt of a dose of 3 @-@ doses of combination . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vacc@@ inations reported 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the Pro@@ ban@@ den , the Ambi@@ rix had received , over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % at the Pro@@ ban@@ den , which had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of matri@@ mon@@ ality was comparable ( i.e. about the entire vaccination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the promot@@ ers , the Ambi@@ rix received , compared to 3@@ 6.@@ 2 % in the Pro@@ ban@@ den , which received the 3 @-@ doses combination . &quot;
the frequency of distinctive pain and balance was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination of combination with the 3 @-@ doses vaccines .
in a comparative study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year vaccines the occurrence of local reactions and general transactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that in administration with the 3 @-@ doses formed infected with the 3 @-@ doses formed hepatitis @-@ A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface .
&quot; however , with the 6@@ - to 11@@ - year @-@ old , however , after vaccination with Ambi@@ rix had a common occurrence of pain ( on the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band . &quot;
the share of vacc@@ inations containing more serious side @-@ effects during the 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ inations with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ inations with the combination of 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B @-@ surface and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface was not different statisti@@ cally .
&quot; clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to 15 years , the ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion@@ rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
the ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion@@ rates for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4.@@ 2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study carried out at 12@@ - to including 15 years of age , 142 two doses received Ambi@@ rix and 147 the default combination with three doses . &quot;
&quot; at the 2@@ 89 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was invaluable , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 @-@ tin in@@ lays was significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the immune response shown in a clinical study study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after completion of the full vaccination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) have been listed in the following table .
in both studies the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ doses vaccines with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses scheme with a combination of 360 ELISA test form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A @-@ virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface .
people who were at the time of pri@@ mers out between 12 and 15 years old could be demonstrated the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies for at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vaccine scheme .
the immune response observed in this study was comparable to that which was noted by vaccination of 3 doses with a combin@@ ant material consisting of 360 ELISA test with a combin@@ ant hepatitis C surface and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial at 12@@ - until including 15 years old could be shown that the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies is comparable 24 months after immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6@@ - months vaccine scheme .
&quot; if the first dose was Ambi@@ rix in the second life year at the same time with the refres@@ hes of a combined Di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis@@ us , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis@@ us ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ umps in vaccine administered was the immune response to all anti@@ gens . &quot;
&quot; a clinical study , which was conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults , showed similar Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ con@@ ges@@ tion as for earlier formulation . &quot;
the vaccine is available as well as after the res@@ ignation as well as after the res@@ ignation of any stranger particles and / or physically visible changes .

at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccine with Ambi@@ rix .
&quot; instead , it will recommend to you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased content of effective ingredients ( 360 ELISA test of a form@@ ic@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface area ) . &quot;
the second vaccination dose of this vaccine with decreased content of effective components is usually administered for a month after the first dose and may give you a vaccination protection prior to completion of the vacc@@ inations .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is suffering from individuals who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems under the skin and not in the muscle . • if you / your child are weak@@ ened due to a disease or treatment in your body &apos;s def@@ ences or if you / your child is sub@@ ordin@@ ated to a her@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination may not be adequate so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccine is .
&quot; 21 Sa@@ w your doctor if you / your child take further medicines / including those who have been vacc@@ inated without a prescription ( including those that have been vacc@@ inated without a prescription ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated without a prescription / was given or immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) have been administered / has , or this is planned in the near future . &quot;
&quot; it may be , however , that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine must be given simultaneously with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and possible different limbs . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix will be administered at the same time , or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or breastfeeding women is not administered , unless it is urgent to vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B . &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination , please talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; cooking very common ( more than 1 case per 10 ver@@ im@@ pf@@ low doses ) : • pains or discomfort at the inser@@ ting , or redness • irrit@@ ability • headaches • loss of appetite • loss of appetite &quot;

&quot; further side effects , the days or weeks after vaccination with comparable combination of hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 sal@@ low doses ) are reported : &quot;
&quot; these include limited or extensive coverage , the it@@ ching can be or blo@@ wer @-@ shaped , swelling of the eye @-@ section and the face , troubled breathing or lo@@ cks , sudden blood pressure and awareness . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packaging to 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; based on the data , which has become known since distribution of the first approval for the ownership , the CH@@ MP opinion that the benefit @-@ risk @-@ risk for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , Ambi@@ rix had only been placed in traffic in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure . &quot;
&quot; in the age of over a month , Am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in pre @-@ history for patients aged over a month or with hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary encephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high am@@ moni@@ ac@@ al concentrations ) . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps will be mixed to meals - split by several single beds to meals - mixed , mixed under the food or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ bis ( through the abdom@@ en in the stomach of leading hose ) or a nose plate ( through the nose in the stomach of leading hose ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study , as Am@@ mon@@ aps not could be compared to another treatment or with placebo ( a head@@ phone medication , i.e. without active ingredient ) . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps also can lead to loss of appetite , a abnormal acid levels , in blood , depression , stimul@@ i , hydr@@ ation , hydr@@ ation , flav@@ oring , rash , vom@@ iting , rash , un@@ pleasing body odor or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ itarian Pharmac@@ eutical Research ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Am@@ mon@@ aps can effectively prevent patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle on high am@@ mon@@ ium values .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps has been approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; as due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval was limited to information on this drug . &quot;
&quot; the use is inde@@ xed to all patients , in which a complete enzyme can already be manifested in the newborn age ( within the first 28 life @-@ age ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ feste ent form ( in@@ complete enzyme ) , then there is an indication for use when in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , there is a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary encephal@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with lo@@ op@@ ic disorders is AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS also available in gran@@ ule form . &quot;
the daily dose will be individually charged with regard to protein intolerance and for the growth and development of the daily protein intake of the patient .
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults . &quot;
in patients suffering from a premature deficiency of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans@@ car@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase is the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required .
patients with a Arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase defect must be arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets must not be administered for patients with dy@@ nas@@ al disorders , as there is a risk for the emergence of oil ha@@ gan@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets are not immediately visible in the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore only be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , or heavy kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency , as well as with sodium and wast@@ ing clinical conditions . &quot;
&quot; since metabol@@ ites and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at over the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution with liver or kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
the importance of these findings in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; at sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slo@@ wing of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and an increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
there also found a delayed impulse of cerebral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be as@@ certain@@ ed if phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted into the mother &apos;s milk and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during the breastfeeding period is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS joined at 56 % of patients at least an unwanted event ( AE ) and 78 % of these undes@@ irable events was assumed that it was not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; the likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year @-@ old par@@ anor@@ tic patient , who developed a metabolic encephal@@ opathy , P@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ie , peripher@@ y N@@ europ@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; a case of over@@ dose , during a 5 months old babies , came up with an accidental dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) . &quot;
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate that showed in a intraven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dose @-@ limited neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound used by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that is ex@@ iled through the kidneys .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ ometric is similar to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative vehicle for elimination of nit@@ rogen nit@@ rogen .
5 patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0,@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be produced .
&quot; it is important that the diagnosis is early on , and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and the clinical outcome . &quot;
the prognosis of the early mani@@ um form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in the newborn age was almost always infectious and the disease itself resulted in the treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with its sti@@ cking @-@ free an@@ alo@@ ga in the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; by her@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nit@@ rogen oxi@@ des ( sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl , sodium and possibly substitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new borrowed at post @-@ part@@ al ( however within the first months of life ) to increase to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary encephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients there was time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits . &quot;
in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ um form of the condition ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ots form of the or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans@@ car@@ b@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) that were treated from a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ e@@ yp@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a prot@@ ein@@ reduced diet amoun@@ ted to the survival rate of 98 % .
existing neurological deficits are hardly rever@@ sible in the treatment and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ den@@ sed in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , using phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were obtained after offering a single dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in so@@ ber @-@ balance sheet as well as repeti@@ tive gifts from oral doses determined by up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients with intraven@@ ous immun@@ oh@@ y@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; after a oral dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl in tablet form , 15 minutes after in@@ ges@@ tion measurable Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations were determined by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
in the majority of patients with urine cycli@@ c dys@@ functions or hem@@ ost@@ asis bin@@ aries ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the next morning no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma was shown .
&quot; in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the medium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma levels were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the cont@@ atis@@ fied product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine crossed over the kidneys .
&quot; according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us testing , Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses received no kl@@ ast@@ o@@ genic effects ( investigation 24 and 48 h after the filing of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2@@ 800 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either oral ( infants and children who can not swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with lo@@ op@@ ic disorders ) or about a guest ro@@ stom@@ a or a no@@ stri@@ ls . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in plasma should be held within the normal range . &quot;
in patients suffering from a premature deficiency of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans@@ car@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase is the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when rats were exposed to the birth of phen@@ yl@@ o@@ at ( active met@@ abo@@ lit by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , it came to lesi@@ ons in the pyramid of brain rin@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; the likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year @-@ old par@@ anor@@ tic patient , who developed a metabolic encephal@@ opathy , P@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ie , peripher@@ y N@@ europ@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ ometric is similar to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative vehicle for elimination of excess .
on the basis of examinations concerning the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen .
&quot; existing neurological deficits are hardly rever@@ sible in the treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur . &quot;
&quot; after a oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in granite form , 15 minutes after in@@ ges@@ tion measurable Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations were detected by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
during the duration of durability the patient can save the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C .
&quot; this procedure includes the small measuring spo@@ on 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring spo@@ on 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spo@@ on 8,@@ 6 g sodium poly@@ ri@@ y@@ vi@@ on . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to get the medication over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at amounts to up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; patients with these rare diseases are missing certain liver enzymes , so that they accum@@ ulate the sti@@ cking @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulate to consumption of proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if you are conducted at your laboratory studies , you must notify the doctor that you can take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can influence the results of certain laboratory studies . &quot;
&quot; taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently been taken , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; while breastfeeding has not allowed to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine could be absorbed into the breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , con@@ cre@@ teness , headaches , taste distur@@ ban@@ ces , descendants of the hearing , dis@@ oriented problems , memory problems and a deterioration of existing neurological conditions were observed . &quot;
if you find one of these symptoms in yourself put yourself immediately with your doctor or with the emergency room of your hospital &apos;s introduction to appropriate treatment .
if you have forgotten the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood sugar to the heart ) , for example with inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ally ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ L &quot; &quot; ( an anom@@ aly in the electro@@ cardi@@ o@@ gram or E@@ KG ) . &quot;
&quot; will An@@ gi@@ ox applied to the prevention of blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose will be administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help in patient with Ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of one PCI .
&quot; roughly 14 000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox near all@@ ine or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins @-@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( GP@@ I ) was compared with conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a GP@@ I . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI the patient often became a st@@ ent ( a short tubes , which remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a clas@@ p ) , and they received additionally other medicines to prevent blood c@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , cardi@@ ac cases or re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year altogether as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who subjected to one PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was just as effective in regards to all indicators as effective as ha@@ par@@ in , except for heavy bleeding , in which it was much more effective than lifting . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox may not be applied in patients who may possibly exceed ( allergic ) against bees , other stag or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as people with heavy hypertension or heavy kidney disease or cardi@@ ac infection . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ itarian Pharmac@@ eutical Research ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is a acceptable substitute for ha@@ par@@ in .
September 2004 the European Commission issued the Company The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd . a permit for the In@@ corporation of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non@@ - ST @-@ Heb@@ rides ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) for an emergency treatment or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bolt from 0.@@ 1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if the patient is carried out in another sequence an PCI is carried out an additional bolt from 0.5 mg / kg and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the operation should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
&quot; after the PCI , the reduced re@@ fusion dose can be resum@@ ed by 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately prior to the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initi@@ als intraven@@ ous breakdown of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a result of directly following intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the operation .
the safety and efficacy of a all@@ ot@@ ted Bol@@ us gift from An@@ gi@@ ox was not tested and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
&quot; this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to 225 seconds , should be shortened as a second fee of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the appearance of lower ACT values , the re@@ formed and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before the application and the bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis can be administered quickly intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is no longer required , provided the 1,@@ 75 mg / kg of in@@ fusion dose is administered properly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney function , ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which is subjected to an PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din against ACS or not ) , a lower fusion rate of 1,4 mg / kg should be used . &quot;
is the ACT value below 225 seconds is a second bol@@ us@@ dose of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg and the ACT 5 minutes to check once again after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis .
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney injury , which resulted in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) which was included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which was included in the ACT value 5 minutes after the Gift of the Bi@@ val@@ u@@ dine @-@ Bol@@ us without a dosage adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 For patients with severe kidney cancer ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also on di@@ aly@@ sis patients is gi@@ gi@@ ox contra@@ indicated ( see below Section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be introduced 30 minutes after termination of the intraven@@ ous ser@@ et@@ ted He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular He@@ par@@ in .
• more well @-@ known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other components or against mil@@ u@@ dine • active blood pressure or increased risk disorders due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ ost@@ al @-@ system and / or mis@@ sive dis@@ mis@@ sive disorder . • harder un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able hypertension ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored throughout the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding particularly when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine is given in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even if at PCI patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine occur most of the bleeding in arter@@ ial point positions , in patients who undergo a per@@ v@@ aneous anth@@ ology ( PCI ) during the treatment basically may occur throughout bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in patients , war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , an monitoring of the IN@@ R Wer@@ ts ( International norm@@ ality Rati@@ o ) should be considered to ensure that the value is achieved after the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine again before the treatment . &quot;
&quot; starting from knowledge about the operation mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tika and thy@@ roid glands , it can be assumed that these substances can increase the danger of blood . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine with thy@@ roid glands or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ al parameters are regularly to control . &quot;
&quot; the experimental examinations are inadequate in terms of effects on pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development , dis@@ binding or post@@ nat@@ al development insufficient ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ized to either un@@ questionable ha@@ par@@ in or em@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ ine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; both in the bi@@ ol@@ ir@@ u@@ dine group as well as in people treated with army @-@ treated groups , it was more common in women and patients over 65 years more often than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding have been defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and TI@@ MI standards for heavy bleeding like in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , young people and children aged six and over with diabetes . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdom@@ inal wall , the thi@@ ghs or the arm inj@@ ected or as permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin in the regulation of glucose ( sugar ) in blood or the insulin is not eff@@ ec@@ tual .
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs significantly from human resources , and the change means that it seems faster and a shorter period of time has become a short @-@ effective human . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in its use in combination with an effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body is not able to produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; with type 2 diabetes , in which the body insulin is not effective , A@@ pi@@ dra was investigated in a study of 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the effectiveness was the amendment of concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ ost@@ ine ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which indicates , how good the blood sugar is set . &quot;
in the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes after six months a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( of 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin is determined .
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal levels . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra must not be applied in patients who may possibly be overweight ( allergic ) against insulin or any other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adapted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that may affect blood glucose levels .
September 2004 the European Commission granted San@@ o@@ fi Av@@ enti@@ s Deutschland GmbH to approve the approval of A@@ pi@@ dra across the European Union .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , either in the field of the abdom@@ en , the waiter @-@ cap or of the Del@@ tam@@ us@@ k@@ els or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion in the field of the abdom@@ inal thickness . &quot;
&quot; due to the decreased glucose capacity and reduced insulin @-@ change , insulin can be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the force , the brand ( Her@@ oes ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , cin@@ ded , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method can draw a change of the insulin delivery . &quot;
&quot; 3 A poor dosage or the her@@ nia of a treatment , particularly in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ de ; these conditions are potentially deadly serious . &quot;
changing a patient to another insulin type or an insulin in another manufacturer should take place under stringent medical supervision and may require a change in dosage .
the timing of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change when changing the lines of treatment .
&quot; to the substances that can increase the blood@@ sugar activity and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ ine ( ACE ) inhibit@@ or , fibro@@ us , flu@@ ox@@ etine , mono@@ chrome oxid@@ ation , se@@ al@@ x@@ yp@@ hen , s@@ ali@@ c acid and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ ies such as bet@@ ab@@ lo@@ osen , C@@ lon@@ id@@ in , Guan@@ ac@@ id@@ ine and reser@@ pine may be allevi@@ ated or absent the symptoms of in@@ ep@@ in@@ ous obj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies for Re@@ production sto@@ x@@ ic@@ ity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ ling@@ ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ ities in terms of pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin is over into the human breast milk , but in general insulin is neither being absorbed into the mother &apos;s milk , nor will it be resor@@ bed after oral application . &quot;

severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ics with consci@@ ous@@ nesses can be treated by in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injections of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which are given by a trained person or treated by intraven@@ ous immun@@ isation by a doctor .
&quot; after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the pri@@ - thing for the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin lo@@ wers the blood sugar level through the stimulation of the peripher@@ al glucose ( especially by skel@@ etal muscle and fat ) as well as by the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
&quot; studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be done faster by insulin @-@ in efficiency , and the activity of action is shorter than in hu@@ - man@@ em . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 diabetes , insulin showed insulin effect in the therapeutic range from 0.@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , a dis@@ proportionate increase in glucose effect , just like Human@@ ité . &quot;
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast pace as normal human and achieves the complete glucose effect of approximately 2 hours earlier than human .
&quot; from the data , it was obvious that in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ ic gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved like with human@@ ic standard , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin was obtained in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale control was given as with human subjects , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin is given to insulin in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal - a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control as for human normally , which is given 2 mi@@ rage before the meal ( see picture 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - previously ) before the beginning of the meal in comparison to human normal , 30 minutes ( normal - 30 min . ) before the beginning of the meal was given ( figure 1 A ) , as well as compared to human normal situation , which was given 2 minutes ( normal - before ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - after@@ ward ) after the beginning of the meal in comparison with human mal@@ ades , which was 2 minutes ( normal - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) . &quot;
