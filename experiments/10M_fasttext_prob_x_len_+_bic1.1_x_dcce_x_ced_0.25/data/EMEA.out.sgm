<seg id="5">"B. Cast thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I-disorder, a mental disorder, in which the patients can have normal episodes (periods abnormal voicing) alternately with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">"bilify is used for the treatment of moderate to heavy Manic episodes, and in the prevention of Manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past."</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is used for quick control of increased anxiety or behavioral disorders if the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both conditions, the solution can be applied to one or the melting pot in patients, which are prepared using tablets difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="9">"patients, who are taking other medicines at the same time, which are just like Abilify, should be adapted to the dose of bilify fy."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitters, i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells. "</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole probably works mainly as "partial Agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazole like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in lesser extent than the neurotransmitters effect to enable the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since dopamine and 5-hydroxytrypcan play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, thus psychotic or manic symptoms will be lessened, causing psychotic or manic symptoms."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the effectiveness of Abilify, the recurrence of symptoms, was investigated in three studies of up to a year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two trials at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which was ill over a period of two hours by placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study Abilify was tested for twelve weeks to 347 patients with Haloperated dol, in another study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo to prevent reoccur in 160 patients in which the manic symptoms have already been stabilized with asbilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injections was found in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered by Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in the symptoms of the patients was examined on the basis of a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also led trials to investigate how the body toned the melting pot and the solution to tear.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both studies with the injection solution shown patients, the Abilify received in doses of 5,25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger diminishing the symptoms of sparked anxiety than the patients receiving a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"when applied to the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-time studies more effective than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks of more effective than placebo the recurrative episodes of previously treated patients, and when in addition to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">Bilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms spared anxiety and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side-effects of bilify fy (observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapidal disturbances, headaches (dropping), vomiting (dropping), vomiting (vomiting), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, restlessness, insomnia (sleeping disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee on Humanitarian Pharmaceutical Research (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify had in treating schizophrenia and in the prevention of a new ic episode in patients who had overwhelmingly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes in the treatment with Aripiprazole are predicting to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the Committee came to the outcome that the benefits of injecting anxiety in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes of bipolar disorder when a oral therapy is not suitable to weigh against the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004 the European Commission issued Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for approval by Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is used for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of the polar disorder and for the prevention of a new ic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes in the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily from meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"increased effectiveness in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, independent of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients, a lower initialdose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 induction is removed from the combination therapy the Aripiprazole should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suizious behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases at the beginning or after the change of an antipsychotic therapy also with treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased risk of addiction risk with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotic medicines.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazole should be applied with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocardinal or ischaemia disease), cervical disease, conditions, which are applied for hypotony (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with bloodshed (including acute and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical studies, which was a year or less persistent, there were occasional reports of over the treatment with Aripiprazole dymis."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if with ABILIFY patients identified signs and symptoms of a late dyspreadsheet, should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient developed signs and symptoms that point out to a mns, or unclear, without any extra clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotic diseases, including ABILIFY, must be set."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore Aripiprazole should be used in the anamnese or in cases associated with cryptocases, with caution."</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis which were treated with Alzheimer's disease patients had treated with Aripiprazole in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">"there was, however, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the anage for unwanted cervical events treated with Aripiprazole-treated patients."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycaemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketacorn or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients suffering from atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycaemia-related undesirable events involving ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic drugs to patients, direct comparisons."</seg>

<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania, in which weight gain is known as side-effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle, and could lead to severe complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nerve system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally efficient medicines involving themselves overbearing side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2-antagonist Famine, an gastric acid blocker, reduces the reset rate of Aripiprazole, however this effect is considered as clinically not relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical trial with healthy promoters, a highly effective CYP2D6-Inhibitor (Chinidin) increased AUC by Aripiprazole around 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected to expect other highly effective inhibitors from CYP2D6, such as Fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose-reduction."</seg>
<seg id="52">"at CYP2D6 'bad' (=" poor ") Metabolisians, the joint application can result with highly effective inhibitors of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extendable metabolites."</seg>
<seg id="53">"if you consider the common gift of Ketoconazol or other high-effective CYP3A4-inhibitors, the potential benefits should be outweigh the potential risks to the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV-Proteaseinhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose-reduction."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after inserting the CYP2D6- or 3A4-Inhibitors, the dosage should be lifted from ABILIFY to the dosage above the beginning of the companion therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 can be administered together with ABILIFY can be calculated with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazole are no significant effect on the metabolites of CYP2D6 (Dextromethyl an / 3-methodology) and 3A4 (Dextroscopy) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphic).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify her doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to the insufficient data base to safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in animal studies, this medicine should not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits justifies clearly the potential risk for the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, like other antipsychotic agents, patients should be warned of using dangerous machines, including power vehicles, to operate, until they are sure that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on it."</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) on than under placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>

<seg id="71">"the side effects which can occur in connection with an anti-psychotic therapy, and their occurrence in treatment with Aripiprazole, include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, spigdynastic events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentionally or intentional allowances were observed with Aripiprazole alone with adult patients with estimated doses observed by up to 1260 mg and without death."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information on the effectiveness of a heredification with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that molysis in the treatment of an overdose of benefits is because Aripiprazole has high plasmapperation."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar co-disorder on the combination of a participatory effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>

<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled Monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I-disorder showed Aripiprazole a over placebo superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled Monotherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed dosing with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I-disorder showed Aripiprazole compared to placebo no superior effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bee-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazole showed up to placebo superior effectiveness in week 3 and a casual effect that was comparable to that of lithium or semi-operated chips in week 12.
