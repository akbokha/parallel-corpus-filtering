&quot; to translate the module , find in the &amp; par@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Ex@@ tras website . select from the listing , select the output and target language of the translation . &quot;
&quot; if a part of the text is selected , only this part is translated into the entire R @-@ URL . &quot;
&quot; machine translation is only very rudi@@ mentary - bab@@ el@@ fish in the best case produces a crude translation and in the worst case nonsense . therefore , the translations should not make important decisions depending on the translation before . &quot;
&quot; only web pages can be translated on the Internet . other texts should be translated on the Bab@@ el@@ fish site , where you can insert a trans@@ lat@@ able text directly . &quot;
&quot; the package package includes various modules for &amp; par@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of &amp; par@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier available . &quot;
more information about using &amp; par@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ;
&quot; to load these modules in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; select Settings extensions .... opening the typ@@ ing card tools and select the desired modules . &quot;
&quot; this is a list of standard installation modules from the pack@@ et ; add @-@ ons . please note that any more modules are installed on your system , in case you have added additional software . &quot;
&quot; you should install the box base , the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click at the &amp; par@@ quer@@ or ; then you can view the page , the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; to the crash , or the list of cras@@ hes , if available , delete . &quot;
&quot; the module An@@ tim@@ filter ( also called the folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; par@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under ex@@ tras An@@ view@@ filter . with the module you can filter &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways . &quot;
&quot; to use the DO@@ M buildings in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; you can choose to display Ex@@ tras DO@@ M tree ... and thus open a new window with the DO@@ M of the document . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , example : document@@ ations , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root canal . &quot;
the Module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; par@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view for objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ Type I@@ node / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different tool@@ bar and text messages to view the content of your local file system .
&quot; the distinctive feature of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in it , conce@@ aled folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . each object is displayed by a rec@@ tan@@ gle with its area proportion@@ ately to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the size of the sub@@ ordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; &amp; FS@@ View ; reflect the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum total of the size of the entries in it . according to that , large files , even then can easily be detected as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; Unix ; command you can be considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the pedal @-@ display a rec@@ tan@@ gle , which represents a file or a folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles possess reasonable colour and description settings . &quot;
&quot; the colour of a rec@@ tan@@ gle , which is switched above view mode , can be either depth for the light detection of the ti@@ stic touch , or the illustration of another file contents , such as name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type . &quot;
&quot; a rec@@ tan@@ gle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each property , you can specify , if enough space to display is present or whether the area of sub@@ ordinate justification may occur ( whereby the display error occurs by restrictions on the sign of the pedal ) . furthermore , you can set the relative position of the lab@@ eling in the rec@@ tan@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; the setting algorithms for pedal aps should be kept to ensure that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ es in &amp; FS@@ View ; this goal is not always respected . it is drawn up , that less space is lost for the frame when the rec@@ tan@@ gle is square . &quot;
&quot; as divi@@ ding the surface of an entry for the sub@@ ordinate entries , the implementation will be left . here , it is necessary for the description and avoidance of space loss by means that rec@@ tan@@ gles arise as possible . the best methods for this are lines , columns or recur@@ sive . &quot;
&quot; you can define the minimal booked area for an entry over the menu entry view points . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the surface of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a sub@@ ordinate entry . &quot;
originally &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets thought that was developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ e@@ gr@@ ind .
the module image gallery can be found in the &amp; par@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Ex@@ tras picture gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
&quot; when you call the image gallery , a dialog will open up with which you can specify the appearance of the gallery . &quot;
the option title of the page allows you to adjust in a text box the title of the picture gallery page .
the option images per line has a sli@@ ders and a hub to adjust the number of thumb@@ nail images of each line in the gallery .
&quot; with the h@@ kreu@@ z fil@@ en@@ ame of the image , you determine whether the file names are displayed among the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the an@@ alogue of file size , see if the file size is displayed among the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the t@@ aps image size , see if the size of the pictures under the thumb@@ nails will be shown in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in a dialog folder , you determine where the gallery will be stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included . &quot;
&quot; in file selection Save in HTML file , enter where the HTML @-@ page is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; with the an@@ alogue field sub@@ folders , you can adjust to a sli@@ ders or a hub , to which level the sub@@ folders can be included . &quot;
&quot; with the str@@ aps of original images , you can copy whether the original images are to be copied to the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the inter@@ sect of a comment , you can use a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the pictures in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the intercom field of color , you can specify for the thumb@@ nails a different colour @-@ depth as in the original pictures . &quot;
the Module &amp; HTML ; settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ;
the Module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under ex@@ tras HTML @-@ settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :

&quot; a simple to use camera point will be provided to you to connect to your digital camera and your photos directly in &amp; checking ; -@@ albums are supported by means of library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and any card reader that is supported by your OS , with &amp; checking ; working together . &quot;
&quot; evaluation came ; contains a quick image processing with basic imaging tools . you can use these to review your photos , comment , review and correct . the handling capabilities can easily be expanded with K@@ DE Image plug @-@ ins interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; though &amp; checking came ; easy to use , it makes use of professional skills available . it works complete in the 16 @-@ bit color foam and all available modules support the raw @-@ conver@@ ts using li@@ bra@@ f , DN@@ G @-@ Export and ICC dy@@ administrative procedures . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more met@@ adata , such as &amp; eg , about the camera or the lens , can be searched for . &quot;
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; checking ; an open source project . that means it is focused on supporting the end users . you should therefore report problems and improvement .
&quot; checking came , trying to make the milking of problems or suggestions as easily as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu features a page with a lower connection system . all required information is already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your account . &quot;
&quot; checking came ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that the user and developer came to each other . if you have a regular user of &amp; checking , please click here for questions to other users of &amp; checking ; however , in this mailing list , you &apos;ll be able to answer any questions of other users . in this mailing list , you should therefore be powerful . &quot;
&quot; you can also visit the press conference , to visit news about released versions and other information about &amp; checking out . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; checking , is registration in the developer mailing list . guide to report on the developer mailing list from &amp; checking out . &quot;
&quot; for the first time you start , you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database . here you can select a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the folder name or click on the folder icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you have to specify a local folder on your computer . this path will remain the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you will be able to add as many folder as you would like to add . &amp; checking out ; will you use additionally as an Al@@ ben@@ library . settings &quot; &quot; Edit &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder , which contains images , as a base folder . &amp; checking came ; read every sub@@ folder as an album . no picture appears on it . during the passage of the folder you will get a further step view like this : &quot;
&quot; checking came ; dur@@ istan search the Bibli@@ othek@@ s@@ ad in its entire depth . you can shut out no sub@@ folder , unless it is in hidden folder . this allows you to get extraordinary &amp; checking out by placing a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a basic folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list may not take photos as symbols . you can change the picture by selecting a most popular photo from the album and this is then called the album symbol . further details can be found in the section albums . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the basic folder , you can enter &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; afterwards you should learn how to use My albums and my keywords in order to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; data backup : if you use the raw mode of your camera , so you may also use it . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ f library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , then you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu Help raw material support . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ m and Ro@@ h work@@ flow .
&quot; a simple to use camera point will be provided to you to connect to your digital camera and your photos directly in &amp; checking ; -@@ albums are supported by means of library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and any card reader that is supported by your OS , with &amp; checking ; working together . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera will then be implemented as a USB mass storage device . the camera will also be implemented via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its derivatives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; digi@@ tization came ; used the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital camera cameras , which has a continuously increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widespread protocol created by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows transferring images from digital cameras to machines and other peripher@@ als without the need of additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transfers over the serial port is slow , this connection is now obsol@@ ete . however , this connection supports pictures with g@@ photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found at this link . &quot;
&quot; li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must be created with li@@ bex@@ if support , so that EX@@ IF support is not required by some li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 compan@@ ys . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the EX@@ IF support may not be available in li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the EX@@ IF support may not be available in li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most beautiful things to see &amp; checking , is how easy to expand its functionality by modules : &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; checking , K@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ gs and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipulate images in virtually any way , as it is also a user . your advantage is that it &apos;s much easier , &amp; checking out ; through writing a small module to supplement a function when the changes in &amp; checking came out . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift . &quot;
&quot; moving and drop images works anywhere : you can disc@@ ard an image in another part of the tree stream , across the horizontal partition line or to another application window . the only constra@@ int is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords , disk list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a data selection allows you to highlight the most common : JP@@ EG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ w , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is used only for the fields , which are currently displayed in the symbol@@ ised view . so the fil@@ let on the fil@@ en@@ ame is displayed only when this ind the tool@@ bar is also displayed . which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the file settings . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ l@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo boxes . all the photos that were taken from &amp; checking , are stored in a single night@@ time . these albums can be sorted according to the folder in which the album was first created , sorted by the name of their collection in the furniture properties or by the date on which the album can be altered in the features of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can scan also a photo directly in an album . choose to scan the album impor@@ ting images . you can also add a scre@@ enshot directly to an album . select songs import@@ ing scre@@ enshot . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move a picture from an album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse on the target album and drop there . in the then appearing menu you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move it to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album includes a collection of photos and the album properties , allowing you to find information about this collection . to access the album properties , you must right click on the album and edit the menu item . &quot;
&quot; album collections : are one method to mark your albums , so that you can select your photos by selecting from the tool@@ bar or view albums . if you want to add or delete new collections from the tool@@ bar . if you want to add or delete new collections from the tool@@ bar you can make this in the settings for collections . &quot;
the album - date : is used when you sort your albums by date with View albums by date sort .
&quot; the buttons El@@ t@@ ester , average , newest : these set the date on that of the oldest , the latest image or the average of the album . first , the average of the pictures will try out of their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last modification of each file in this folder will be used . &quot;
&quot; if you first entered an album in &amp; Edit , the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol of the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ l@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; chosen . sometimes , the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and click in the context menu &amp; quot ; As a night@@ um@@ look at the list . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can always be included in a collection and collections can not be scr@@ apped .
&quot; checking came ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the range my key@@ word list left down in the main window . album collections have another effect . to the collection include all photos of the album . of course , you can use both methods to organize your photos . &quot;
&quot; the picture window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures in this album are displayed in the picture window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two lou@@ pe buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; if you open an album the first time , you need to wait briefly while the thumb@@ nails will be generated . this can avoid you in which you re@@ use the menu Ex@@ tras All preview images . &quot;
&quot; information on each image is displayed below the thumb@@ nails . what information this is , you can browse through settings ; set up here . choose the albums page and customize the area thumb@@ nail to your wishes . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nail pictures have help window , the loc@@ . if you want to rest a moment over a picture . the help shows the main characteristics including all the tags of a photo . the scre@@ enshot shows in the section introduction into the main window shows such a help window . &quot;
photos are all what happened at &amp; checking ; go . albums and tags allow you to organize your photos as it suits you . you can get all the functions that come with &amp; checking out . you can choose between the context menu of preview or the menu image in the menu bar . you can choose between the viewing images , a di@@ h@@ au or the editing of pictures . &quot;
you can open the picture editing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 image editing ... or the contex@@ tual menu of the picture with the right mouse button and Edit ... you can select a guide on how to edit your photos . with the picture editing you can view your photos and change it .
&quot; it may happen that &amp; checking came ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by clicking the context menu with the right mouse button . for this , and how to customize this your needs , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should note that after processing by other image processing programs you may come to problems with the data contained in the picture . some programs do not store this data from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture etc . &quot;
&quot; currently , there are two possibilities for rotation . the easiest way to click the preview is to click on the preview and select rotating . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , you can click with the right mouse button on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . note that you maintain the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you got a photo of &amp; checking , delete , it will move in the trash cans of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . f@@ 8 picture del@@ e@@ tion or deto@@ x if you prefer really del@@ eting , you can use this by using Shift . &quot;
&quot; view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sl@@ at quot ; organize your photos on the basis of the data . &amp; checking came , use either the EX@@ IF @-@ date or , if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all the photos of this month will be shown in the file view . you can choose days or weeks in the date sheet bottom in the file view , so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown . &quot;
photos with key@@ word provides a flexible and powerful option to organize your photos and cat@@ alo@@ ze . tags are sti@@ ckers who can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a key@@ word has been assigned to a photo may be found by selecting this key@@ word or search .
&quot; when a key@@ word is selected , all photos that have been marked with this key@@ word are shown . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . here you can also make your tags logical . you can also make parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My sampling record , so you can find the keywords you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and proven key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the picture , at least for JP@@ EG , so you can also use your tags in other programs . besides , the keywords will be re @-@ imported in loss of the database as soon as possible ; the pictures noticed . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by using the right mouse button , either on &amp; quot ; My key@@ word &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; add new key@@ word &quot; &quot; after you add a new key@@ word after you have clicked on an existing line , this becomes a sub@@ ver@@ b of this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word using the right mouse button and Dele@@ te . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo . &quot;
&quot; you can change the position of a key@@ word by moving it to the desired position in the tree , and drop there . then a menu that gives you the option to reloc@@ ate . a key@@ word can only be once a tree at a time . &quot;
&quot; you can change the properties of a key@@ word by clicking it with the right mouse button and edit in the context menu . you can edit the name of the sample and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , you must select the picture with the right mouse button , and select in the context menu . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; for checking ; s functionality with key@@ word to be able to handle , you must first specify your photos with key@@ word , you can click on the appropriate word in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; alternatively , you can click on the thumb@@ word click on the images and select from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; you can choose a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords called his wei@@ ghty tags . in this way you can select a key@@ word for any person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , at which it was made etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with key@@ word , this is displayed under the preview of the picture in the main window . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a key@@ word in which you click with the right mouse button of the photo and select from the tags menu . the menu shows you only the keywords , which have been assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the time@@ frame view shows a time @-@ dependent h@@ isto@@ gram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can click on this h@@ isto@@ gram . to select a time frame , you only need to select to the lower right of the selection panel , which is the time unit indicated . thus , all related images are displayed in the main window . &quot;
&quot; in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . then it appears in the list below . &quot;
&quot; include all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , data collections , and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; Neb@@ ula er Re@@ box is a small lamp to find the green if the search takes place . if you click here the filtering is deleted and all the pictures again displayed . if the search has nothing found , then the lamp becomes red . &quot;
the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the tel@@ escope . if you open this you can get a simple search box as described above . you can search this search here but as a live search that has always been fil@@ tered out as a search criterion . after you have saved the filter in the list .
&quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search is done . the text box save search than is used to choose your request to choose a name in My search list . if you choose to choose your selection from my search list , you just need to select the corresponding entry from the view My search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you want to edit search , the form to enter the search again with the previously entered search information . if you select As extended search , the dialog for the extended quest to change your previous search . here you will find more rules for finding out your previous search . further information can be found in section The tools for Advanced search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select in the context menu search . &quot;
&quot; the Advanced search provides you with an exten@@ sible search form with many search@@ ers , with which you entered in certain fields of &amp; checking ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of search procedures is used to set the options for a search query in the file database . any option can be deleted with others over the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or Min@@ es ... link above . in addition , you can create finding the type &amp; quot ; AND NIC@@ HT@@ quot ; create . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization came ; character@@ izes any picture by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these sig@@ natures . the lower the difference between two sig@@ natures and the more they correspond to . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each picture to find a similar . by means of a spon@@ ge , the results can be enlarged or down@@ sized . if you want to shift a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then this will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sketch : hand @-@ hand color@@ sketch : draw a fast sketch and &amp; checking ; find the matching images . also here a spon@@ ge can be set .
&quot; this rider represents an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can press with the mouse wheel in or out zo@@ oming , and move it . all the pictures within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course , this requires your images ge@@ o data . &quot;
&quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . it is then added for later use of the list below . it works like a live Ge@@ o @-@ folder . &quot;
&quot; checking has entered a lumin@@ aire in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . it works with all supported image formats , also raw files , together . &quot;
&quot; select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em illumin@@ tal add from the context menu . the selection is added to the light table and open its windows . if you are back in &amp; checking , main window , you can open the lumin@@ tically fast with L Ex@@ tras lumin@@ aire . &quot;
&quot; from the preview bar you can drag the pictures you want to compare in the left or right area of the window , and drop there . a small arrow indicates which copy in which window list is to be seen . so , you can preview the same area of the two images , so you can compare the same area of the two images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to sort out quickly from a picture series . if you use p@@ air@@ wise navigate from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically displayed in the areas to display . the right adjacent picture is displayed in the right area . this simpli@@ fies it through a number of similar pictures . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal sol@@ dering actions are also working directly from the lumin@@ aire as e.g. F@@ 4 file Edit .... &quot;
all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails in the lighthouse . this makes it e.g. to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you can see to the crossed arrows . in order to minimize the visible range of the picture , you need to click this and the &amp; L@@ MB . in the mode Pre@@ view both images will show the same picture area . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works equally well as in other views . simply use the zoom re@@ gler among the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel round in the image in and out of zo@@ oming . this happens in both images if you are in the mode Pre@@ view .
&quot; what is a digital inventory - apart from the fashion office ? digital stock management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to the final edition and the permanent storage . each of us does not record a form of digital inventory , but most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we will provide you with a tool , plan and practical tips on how to secure your pictures , protect , protect and use photos . we consider downloading , ren@@ ame , evaluate , evaluate , evaluate , evaluate , evaluate , maintain , maintain , maintain , maintain and export image files . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization inventory , categ@@ orized , categ@@ orized , categ@@ orized , ass@@ uring , is looking , transformed , pre@@ assembled and exported content that have a monetary or cultural value . &quot;
met@@ adata is defined as data on data . met@@ adata is defined according to your definition data that provide information on or for documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
&quot; I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t even need to know how many photos you have , then you certainly don &apos;t use &amp; checking ; the approach the met@@ adata for both in a database as well as in the image files , you will certainly use very fast finding and a secure archiving you can access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
the first thing you do and need to know before you maintain any thing in your system is the structure of information structure compared to the data structure . your image files must somehow be stored on your computer if you want to save it to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; take note that you eventually have to change to a greater drive .
&quot; maybe you &apos;ll be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly about your location . if you were using enough photos , then you will print sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then export a folder for images that you can print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have different requirements such as ver@@ aging the photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % working files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organise your structure for such content . &quot;
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the stack @-@ processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation from original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative image .
&quot; we also recommend the option met@@ adata to be saved in the settings page of the met@@ adata page , which ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written in the file . if you forget this , you can select the met@@ adata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the menu Album . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what to change ? to make a met@@ adata editor for a number of selected attributes , these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now , the real work begins , since you should now select all the images , description and a review . of course , you can select all the pictures that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense , as you can concentrate on the best photos at the best work . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s work with keywords , keywords , as well as other programs often called , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; checking came ; automatically the tree for you build b@@ z@@ w the pictures to the right place . the changed keywords will be done by clicking on another . the changed keywords will be pursued by &amp; checking ; updated while the sub@@ trees are tr@@ acked . &quot;
the graphic shows how different met@@ adata is cut . this is a very rough representation since each block of met@@ adata in truth consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar dates are characteristic of all images .
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to gra@@ ft@@ ings or comments , the third important tool to catalog your met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t want to see most of your photos just , they want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . you are sure how your photos will arrive . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then catch some details to see people , the place . &quot;
&quot; now I say to you this is the landing stage of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start to dream , associations , the historical time period is present again , you might even hear the silence . the cap@@ tion therefore has completely changed your perception of this panoramic location . &quot;
&quot; for others who view your photos the title may be more important than the picture itself to create an interest . if you show images you should tell a story . remember , the key is to help you understand about the motive it has moved to what you understand . &quot;
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for himself alone .
&quot; with &amp; checking , you can export as much text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as cap@@ tion . if you export your pictures into Web @-@ galleries , then these alleg@@ ations are exported to your wishes in the lab@@ eling and / or the title of the Web @-@ Gal@@ ery system . &quot;
&quot; remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without navigation system ? it was not a boring planet before Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation already starts with light speed . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities to exploit the ge@@ olo@@ ur@@ isation are already un@@ coun@@ table and will be used in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can export your trips by using images with geographical references . however , the pictures can also export to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps observer . &quot;
&quot; copy@@ left is a word game with copyright and describes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you which information came in the ordering page of &amp; checking ; as information can be deposited :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creators and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo . for example , if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer , for example , the name of a company or organization may not be changed . this field does not support Com@@ mas nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for editor ) : linked to the author . this field contains the work@@ book of the photographer . examples of this can be the work of photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or Independent Social photographer . since this is a comment to the author &apos;s field , this must also be filled out . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider to identify who has the photo . this does not necessarily need to be the author . if the photographer is listed here for a news agency , like Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press . if the photographer is a bearing photo , then the group / Agency is shown here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this cannot provide protection against abuse . each one of the little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator may delete or modify this . the solution to this problem is digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important . &quot;
&quot; the digital water@@ mark is unique for each picture . &amp; checking came , will provide such a module for st@@ acking processing in the near future . &quot;
&quot; issues : record errors , record failure , EC@@ C , transmission error , aging of memory media , restore , redund@@ ancy , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ sti@@ tion &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same which can happen to you in traditional paper images or neg@@ atives . in this section we are dealing with problems with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; roll On@@ track , the largest database company in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes a loss of data . &quot;
&quot; to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs must be treated more cautious and you can no longer use CDs and DVDs in archive quality , you can also get CDs and DVDs in archive quality . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that has a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . whether you believe that is in your surve@@ ying room . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable but you can use this risk in which you can use good discs and good recording equipment , and they are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot of reliable . so it is all about choosing the right choice . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to error , even if you are just first written . that &apos;s why they use a control mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data is only effective data , the rest we needed for the form@@ atting , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; for faul@@ ty CDs and DVDs there is a discounted program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster the apparent miracle of CDs and DVDs . it works under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but there are similar applications the damaged data of damaged dis@@ ks , hard disk , flash drives , etc . read out . &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to save the For@@ mat@@ ing War against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost tr@@ sm@@ al the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.@@ 5 GB . all that has been said to CDs and DVDs is of course also available for Blu @-@ ray Disk .
&quot; slowly burn with a good recording device on high quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ate format . also , if you read the media with a description , date &amp; author marks and then on a clean , dark dry and above animals protected area . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of hardware or software that can read the media . &quot;
dis@@ disk makers keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturing guarantee will include a new disk but not the data . Google will provide a large field study on the error mechanisms of dis@@ ks : dis@@ ruption
&quot; shortly : dis@@ ks keep the longest when you are operated in the temper@@ ar@@ tur@@ area of 35 ° C up to 45 ° C . these errors are not the most common fault of fault , SM@@ ART can not notice these errors . however , these are especially les@@ ef@@ eh@@ ler and evac@@ uation teeth . the expected lifetime time is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
this is just the loss of loss due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also have data loss due to a black@@ out before you have secured the files but these losses normally can be recovered without major problems .
&quot; while most electrical appliances do not make much difference , that can cause serious damage when using computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . thus , these abnorm@@ alities may cause severe damage , hardware design , destructive mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
the most widespread protection against electricity tips is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is absorbed part of the energy heat and the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in . but remember that not every socket also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should be careful that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also be careful to protect the protection against lightning bolt , thus protecting the properly connected devices . &quot;
&quot; as an over@@ voltage of each cable can use to your machine , you should note that even all the peripher@@ als that are connected to your system . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage protective for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axi@@ al cable of the cable car and the television card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a notebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore contain very small and you also contain the protection for the modem . this makes you ideal for travel . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection your system will protect against minor fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a drop of few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful in making uninterrupted power supply . &quot;
&quot; besides the protection from over@@ voltage ti@@ ghtness , these devices can automatically launch cordless energy . this gives you the possibility to save your data and go down the system . however , if you purchase a US@@ V , you should be sure that they are using the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the underlying software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; concern the potential risk to which your computer system is exposed and compare your safety when using electricity with the cost of avoiding this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can be available for less than a euro . for example , this is just a small price difference if you consider getting all cables off before you go on holiday . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web @-@ Service contains S@@ 3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service . with the right configuration you can use this as drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup goal for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer which you can store any amounts of data . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to hard drives , however , very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you have to send the data about the compar@@ atively slow Internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general security solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo @-@ community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . the professional version will not provide you with full resolution online . the professional version will not provide you with full resolution online . for 25 $ per year you get unlimited memory , which should be checked in reality only . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of the data backup , the web @-@ solutions are very secure . transmission error will be automatically certified by the TCP protocol and with the large companies is included in the offer a backup and a partial storage . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all transm@@ issions are suscep@@ tible to transfer errors . the fil@@ esystem and b@@ tr@@ fs make at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive safely .
&quot; the worst thing is that no one says if a transmission error occurred , not when this occurred in your hardware . all these disorders remain un@@ discovered until you &apos;re going to have no protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought about it . the internet with its TCP protocol is a significantly safer data away than that in your computer . &quot;
un@@ reliable power parts are another source of transmission loss as they create interference within the data stream . in normal fil@@ es@@ ystems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transfer issues , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year . &quot;
&quot; C@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates to be able to deal with plate errors , and is available under a compliant license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is available soon for &amp; Linux and Windows . read this article in English . &quot;
&quot; Oracle has launched an own initiative with its b@@ ypass file system . it is still used in the Alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms , and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel . &quot;
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the notebook and 46 % in the workplace systems . at not@@ ebooks the proportion of theft is already 50 % .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than the Me@@ ists think . it leads to a lower damage , such as theft or re@@ install@@ ations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under Linux ; no longer has been sighted . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , rout@@ ing , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the spread fil@@ esystem . here you can find a very good English article here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the test process at a sudden break during an operation is higher and an in@@ defin@@ able status will be avoided . if a file has not been completely saved before the issue entered , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
&quot; sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings removed from fundamental physical borders . it is meant that while the technology is further developed , there is a natural fron@@ tier for this progress . sensitivity and in@@ sensitivity to all kinds of light sensors are not far away from this border . &quot;
&quot; today , cameras get into the direction of 10 Meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel . for higher resolution , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . &quot;
&quot; you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; therefore , do not make anyone else for data loss . so ensure your data often in one plan and test this backup before you do anything other than the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of plates or the size of hard disk drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash , you are lucky if the drive is not connected to the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft no@@ gl@@ ücke : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ ase does not always mean local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs into the neighboring building , in your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as above mentioned is a common cause of losing a loss of data despite backup the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential assurance : a backup of the files changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot of two time points : the full backup and the last differential assurance .
&quot; incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates several mom@@ entary recordings . you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup has been made . this protection comes up with an extension system at the next , with the exception that it was just cool@@ ed and not continuous . &quot;
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . contrary to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other kinds of file trans@@ cription trans@@ cri@@ r@@ sync only the difference of files that are really changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh
secure important pictures directly after you have stored them on your computer to DVD or other optical medium .
this procedure lets you enough time to detect losses and restore it . at the same time you come up for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days to make a weekly snapshot for at least a month and a snapshot for each month . every additional th@@ inner should be done manually after which you have made a complete review .
&quot; topics : met@@ adata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ ent pictures and met@@ adata , copy of the pictures to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; so that valuable pictures survive the next 40 years , that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; because the future is unfor@@ es@@ ee@@ able due to your nature , you need to look at what is said today with caution and evaluate anew during time . unfortunately , there is no other way than a certain vigil@@ ance . the less variations you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is nowadays available for anyone . so if you have an old system important that reading your images is important then you keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your machine architecture , your memory and safety technology , or your file format , you should check your library and when necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means growing .
let &apos;s assume that you plan your scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new record :
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , whether your new record was detected by the system , but do not hang them . &quot;
&quot; &amp; dollar ; DD if = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of reis@@ er@@ fs if necessary &quot;
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day does not exist any software you can read it . this task will be easier from year to year .
&quot; G@@ IF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . so you should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; P@@ NG was used as an open source standard developed by the G@@ IF . however , it is los@@ s@@ free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit per colour channel and full transparency . P@@ NG is required that it is relative many administrative information , but not as many as TI@@ FF are needed and a slow volume compression . this format is recommended to store your images . &quot;
TI@@ FF was widely used as a picture format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss of low compression sal@@ g@@ ents ( de@@ fl@@ ate ) . a problem is however that this format has been adjusted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a licence @-@ free and open pipe format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G was developed on the TI@@ FF / EP format and comm@@ its to the use of met@@ adata . a handful of camera suppliers is now available and we hope to use the co @-@ rated Canon and Nikon .
&quot; this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata quot ; the file information is available with extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in the rough format , because it saves the met@@ adata separately from the image file . however , you should think about problems in the connection between the met@@ adata and the image file . therefore , you should consider if you use DN@@ G as a container and put it all there . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization that supports fully compatible online met@@ adata working for a wide range of application purposes and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in D@@ C@@ MI communities , regular connections and educational efforts to achieve a wider acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . for as long as the pictures on the camera edi@@ um , you can use it as temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save it in your blank archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a fin@@ ite processing , you can use external programs . if you have the pictures again with &amp; checking ; edit , then you should add the met@@ adata again . these were under circumstances cut off from the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the processed pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only in Web@@ Gall@@ eries , code in MPEG , use in contact datas@@ he@@ ets , print and etc . &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; checking out . in the section adding a photo to an album you will find a description of how to add photos you already have on your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import images to your Al@@ ben@@ database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; checking , connect them to the computer , turn off the camera on the ad mode and turn it into . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , the file name appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will display . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file name and a symbol for file order will appear for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera data on each entry . with the page properties and met@@ adata from the camera interface , you can see the characteristics of one application or its met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; this dialog shows file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer , please note that in some digital cameras do not have all the information available . &quot;
&quot; the rider Met@@ adata shows the internal met@@ adata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer remark , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as in the met@@ adata page from the main window of &amp; checking ; or picture editing . please note that these met@@ adata will not be available in some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection of all . this loads all photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; checking ; . when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures are sure to delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired pictures selected from &amp; k@@ de ; select the button below and then download the selected button . the button chosen is as long as if you selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera is supported , option is not download@@ able . these pictures have been deleted until now . if you choose this option , of course , only the new pictures are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; when you download the buttons All download or download files , a dialog with which you can choose the target album , in which the photos are stored . details of the folder you can read in section My records . select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; checking ; invites the photos of the camera into the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the pictures you want , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of the information once you delete the button Dele@@ te . if you only want to delete some , then you need to delete them first and delete it . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no possibility to re @-@ install photos you deleted from the camera . so the photos are not deleted in the trash cans , so if you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to make the camera out completely , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; cameras use as a file name for the photos often not particularly expres@@ sive names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are normally reviewed again after the photos were deleted from the camera . this can be useful to double data stream in the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the photo was taken into the fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirrors of the picture and for dat@@ ag@@ onal sub@@ mit@@ es . if you use this last option , a folder will be automatically created each day . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three more options that are performed before the photos are stored on the plate . the first two affect the data on the author Standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty . if you select this , the corresponding entries from the EX@@ IF information will be displayed in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to use a different date format than the standard format , you may , for example in editing field the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- % Y@@ - % m@@ - % D : % S . switch to the option date &amp; time . for further modifications you should read the help of the command str@@ y@@ time . &quot;
&quot; if you use the camera file name , you have the option to modify the file name in small case letters . or in major case letters , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new file name , the &amp; checking came ; used for a photo , will be shown below the name that will preview the camera in the preview . your settings to ren@@ ame are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time . &quot;
&quot; checking came ; can use all the information on the orientation of the camera to the time area of recording . not all cameras get this information available . in the side@@ bar Met@@ adata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera fails to supply this information , leaving the photo . if you want to switch the automatic spin off , use the button inv@@ aded and choose the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera has information about the date , where the photo was made available , you can upload it to download it . all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in section side@@ bar Met@@ a data you can read out which information your camera could have embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually switched off , and in this case writes &amp; checking ; the photos directly on the target album . if you want to change this option , you need to switch this option . simply use the button @-@ based sub @-@ based sub @-@ base at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to load photos of your machine to their camera is the button button . select then upload . select the file box dialog &amp; k@@ de ; you can also select more than one file using the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods can also be selected . &quot;
&quot; after the selection is done , asks &amp; checking ; you where to load the pictures to the camera . select the folder and press OK to start the up@@ loading . the pictures will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this is a position indicated in long@@ itu@@ dinal and lati@@ tudes , which can be displayed on a map . identification of data can be performed by American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it may be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an airplane to kar@@ to@@ graphic an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environ@@ ment@@ plann@@ ers , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten where exactly the photo was done , you can easily locate a browser which indicates the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; checking , users want to locate the location of the photo so it is good to record the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and cards refer@@ enced . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a post @-@ editing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical assignment ( manual ) and finally about the manual input of known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS recei@@ vers . either as a card module or through transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye and A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon D@@ CS Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ p@@ s@@ ba@@ bel . however these data will be stored in the g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the module to the geographical assignment .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS which can extract the data of images and from GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux : g@@ p@@ s@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ p@@ s@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itu@@ dinal and lati@@ tudes or other data , then you can use this script using the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ tool of Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the characters who have been created by m@@ ap@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ m@@ ap@@ s.@@ google@@ .com shows no European street cards . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization came ; attempts to give as much control over his work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings to access the behavior of &amp; digi@@ tization . in order to access these settings , you must log in in eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the symbols of the left . &quot;
&quot; select action can be set to embedded pre@@ viewing or set image processing , so you set the default behavior of &amp; checking ; firm , if you click on an entry in the main view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardization of identity and copyright data . these data are automatically selected in the appropriate IP@@ TC data fields . also with database synchron@@ isation , these data are written in the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; author is a syn@@ onym for editor . this field should be the professional designation of the photographer . this can also be a written photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a detailed description of the author , this must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for provider : use this field to specify the photo . this does not have to be the author , when this one is listed here for a news agency , such as Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press , then the group or agency should be listed here , then the group or agency that the image will be en@@ umer@@ ated here . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ TC promotions save the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC rock . this is achieved , that the met@@ adata are permanently contained in the picture and not only in the database of &amp; checking ; these met@@ adata are also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; checking ; imported into account will be lost without being lost . &quot;
&quot; cap@@ tions as well embedded def@@ enses ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JP@@ EG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you add to your photos , with those contained in the pictures . thus , your complaints can also be read by other image applications . this will be over@@ written by the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the page settings contains all the options for the information that appear , if the mouse cursor in the main window appears above a file . depending on the chosen option , this information will be displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; # 160 ; digi@@ tization came ; supports a number of different image formats and some video formats . to determine which file types &amp; checking came ; displaying , you can add the file exten@@ tions of this list and remove . any file in one &amp; checking file which did not have any of these extensions , ignored by &amp; checking ; ignored . &quot;
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Up@@ dating right of each category .
&quot; the settings of the lumin@@ aire from the checking came , can be set on this page to the default values . however , if you then open the lumin@@ aire . some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; in the whole picture @-@ size lad@@ en@@ quot ; if you have one , then you can hereby get better informed results . &quot;
&quot; by default , the image processing uses a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer other color , you can select it here . you can switch the tool@@ bar if you use the tool@@ bar in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or bri@@ ghter color in the picture . these colours are specified here . in image processing this picture mode can be set up with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 and be switched off .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling is meant that the pictures are co@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the dy@@ es . please read this article in Wikipedia about the explanation .
&quot; with the adjustment P@@ NG compres@@ sing , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality as P@@ NG uses a loss @-@ free algorithm . however , if you have a quick machine , you can set this value on a high compression . thereby , 1 : a low and 9 a high compression . &quot;
&quot; with TI@@ FF files , you can switch the de@@ fl@@ ate compression to TI@@ FF @-@ images . this reduces the size of TI@@ FF pictures . it does not affect the image quality since the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm loss is los@@ sy . &quot;
&quot; with the adjustment loss of JP@@ EG @-@ 2000 files you can save losses . even if you choose the los@@ sy setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in the normal JP@@ EG . as this paragraph was written , met@@ adata was not yet supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; checking , the picture editing was only a pic@@ torial for photos . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool for manipulation your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of picture editing . &quot;
the default ame is that all green pixels are the same . if you use this option with minimal loss in the output . if you use this option with a minimum loss of details . this option draws the image a little soft , eliminated but the 2x@@ 2 slide pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the whit@@ eboard is used to the camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this option is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is it a solid colour balance , which was photographed on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super C@@ CD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposure images got more details in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the default is it the cutting edge , so the parts of your images are burned out , due to the in@@ ability of your camera to look at the advanced settings . finally , use the setting finishes in various ro@@ at@@ ches . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the sh@@ utter . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixel generally doesn &apos;t get as quick as green and red . &amp; checking came , and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red @-@ shares from the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixel . of course , this is a question how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; when selecting the option re@@ construct , you get the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted for each picture individually . &quot;
&quot; set the weight value according to your taste . you probably have to put it a bit higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also later be done in the picture options of the &amp; digi@@ tization . to keep the time for the demo@@ graphics , you should proceed conservative . &quot;
&quot; a dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial fil@@ tered data , which have many cameras and which is known as CF@@ A @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour construction . &quot;
&quot; checking came ; and D@@ cra@@ w make you three alternatives available : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( Vari@@ able number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm that was used by D@@ cra@@ w . but it creates Far@@ bar@@ te@@ fak@@ te to edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting when you look for a quick fix with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color sof@@ tening of your lenses , you can bet the red and blue @-@ proof values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , since you are carried out during the pipe . &quot;
&quot; a profile transl@@ ates the bul@@ bin@@ information and gives instructions like them to be given . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; checking came , information such as the farms of a color tree to translate into the others so that the colors are as accurate as possible . &quot;
behavior questions when a picture is opened in image processing / paint management module with pipe files .
&quot; file Profile Set@@ ting here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you save all your profiles . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles you have the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; all your profiles can be deposited . everything can be changed when opening the pipe file .
the coloring view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here only your pictures are not managed not all of the screen .
&quot; input profiles should be used to the camera manufacturers and model that you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . currently there are some , such as Canon , which do not have any color correction or gam@@ ma@@ re@@ tin@@ cture . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma does not have to perform for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the color button . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the soft @-@ pro@@ of profile , which you can em@@ ulate how your image can be returned from a device . this is very useful before you print image , since your printer can function a smaller color area as your camera and some colors therefore can be very satisfied , instead of leaving on the flas@@ hes algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is fairly obvious to suit the color profile with them for what is . unfortunately here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course , this answer is un@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon pro@@ long@@ ation leaves the style for the goal : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Neutr@@ al , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; images of image and image processing are supported ; many modules have been written to work with each program , which supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the files you want to use , and they will then be downloaded from &amp; checking ; these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you will also find in the context menu of the main window . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under settings , &quot;
further information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the Di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the top regul@@ ator controls the time between the transi@@ tions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other tick @-@ fields turn off the met@@ adata and that appear at the bottom of the pictures while the ad appears . &quot;
&quot; the camera properties show on the left a list of all supported cameras . on the right hand side there is a button automatic detection , which is trying to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . currently you are the serial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) from the camera . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / or , specify on which you attach your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; checking , you must connect the camera to your computer , install it in the ad mode . &quot;
&quot; check out if &amp; checking came ; the camera automatically recognizes . if not , you can set cam@@ er@@ od@@ ell and Port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the menu camera . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all here . &quot;
&quot; with the option of confir@@ ming dialog for p@@ anning &gt; images in the tr@@ ash@@ can show , you can adjust the talk of &amp; checking ; when del@@ eting a photo on an album . in the sections of del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album you can find more details . &quot;
&quot; editorial changes through the right side bar can still be tac@@ kled through &amp; checking , when you use the option changes in the right side bar without reg@@ inqu@@ ire . otherwise , you must apply the changes with the button changes . &quot;
you can also submit the display of the welcome screen of &amp; checking ; in case of startup . it speeds up under circumstances the start process of &amp; checking ;
&quot; the setting Bei@@ m Start for new photos is forcing &amp; checking , the first @-@ time sub@@ folders after new or deleted albums / photos came . this prolon@@ gs the start @-@ time frame , asks &amp; checking ; you , if it should delete it from the database . &quot;
different color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; checking ; used to customize the main window to suit your tastes . these settings can be selected under settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs are listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; checking , please find more information about it in this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; however , it includes a quick image processing with several basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and to correct correc@@ ting and improve . picture editing can be started by clicking on the preview of an image or by the contex@@ tual menu of entry / editing . &quot;
image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; checking . so you are not part of your distribution . you can find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in section image editing .
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current date number , enlargement factor , and the current image size indicates . &quot;
&quot; a menu bar on the top of the top , including the tool@@ bar to quickly access the most common functions . &quot;
&quot; editing functions of the image processing will change your photos . however , no functions will change the original photo before you save file or the button save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo as soon as you have the image saved . &quot;
so you should be able to make a copy of your image before you change it . this can save you with file save .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by restoring it in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change that you have done in the photo since the last time saving . &quot;
virtually any action of picture editing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action you can und@@ o by selecting to re@@ install items or restored by selecting editing items from the menu .
&quot; if you frequently use this , you should make yourself the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z for the back , and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you want to press the &amp; L@@ MB in the tool@@ bar or restore the button bar in the tool@@ bar . if you select one of the menu items , all actions in between are also revers@@ ed or recovered . &quot;
&quot; once you have started painting finishing , you can move between photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image sli@@ pped up or the entries in the menu file . if you have any changes in the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
you can in the photo in and out zo@@ oming in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in tool@@ bar or the entries in the menu bar .
&quot; to customize a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : add enlargement factor automatically . &quot;
&quot; view full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view , in which you don &apos;t want to use the tool@@ bar . if you do not want this , you can view this in the setting dialog by &amp; checking ; see this you can call from the &amp; checking ; main window view . see this section for setting up the picture editing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print image in the menu File , and get the default dialog box . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print single images or whole sentences . whole picture @-@ looking pages can select from your selection . you just need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export Manager . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the digi@@ tization came ; main window has a side bar on the right edge , the important information and actions for the selected images available . the same page bar is available without the navigation device , even in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five horse@@ men is clicked on : &quot;
multiple c@@ aries clicked on the same rider leaves the side bar and disappear into the edges .
&quot; in the description view , you can fill in ri@@ ft@@ ings with unlimited size or insert . note the note below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed to be used in the EX@@ IF@@ C and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can use other programs . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC data only supports AS@@ C@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are converted to 2000 characters and special characters will be converted . if you want to use the IP@@ TC text field in other applications , you should be aware of these restrictions . &quot;
&quot; after you have commented on , you either use the button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the application button there is one button More . with this , you can read more met@@ adata from the selected file or database . however , this is always carried out if you choose a met@@ adata setting that will always be written into the pictures . &quot;
the review report shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in seeking and sor@@ ting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut . to evaluate multiple images at the same time select it and use the contex@@ tual menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field . enco@@ ding follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the key@@ note shows a search box to the filter of the keywords , the sample @-@ tree and a comb@@ o box with the previously mentioned ; -@@ session addressed . &quot;
the sampling tree is adapted dynam@@ ically to the search criteria . you can limit the number of options looking for a key@@ word quickly . this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom is another relief when entering keywords at a picture series . if you have entered different keywords , these are saved for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by flag@@ ging the corresponding tick @-@ fields in the tree . all the tags of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
&quot; if several pictures selected in the main view and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word , this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not applied to the whole selection , if you want a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word section . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar chart is used to change the selection of images shown in the main window . usually , the left side@@ bar with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , sampling and view@@ points are used , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all presented keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also draw a tags and disc@@ ard it . suppose you have selected several pictures in the main window , in order to put you with key@@ word . if the key@@ word exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . ther@@ eu@@ pon , a dialog that asks you whether you want to set the key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example shows the main window images on a calendar day . the sampling filter stands on no keywords , which reduced the amount to three pictures . they were taken with Str@@ g + a , and afterwards a key@@ word was drawn from the right key@@ word on the selection and stored there . a dialogue asks if this key@@ word should be set . &quot;
this search for changes will take place at every start of the program . it can also be turned out under settings &quot; Miscellaneous . &quot;
&quot; if you usually have created and created a rule and find that it should be one or its , you can easily change this easily with a double @-@ clicking on the text and in the rules range . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry to which in the database is sought . this can be an album , name , keywords , image , key@@ word , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already set in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can specify a further search for all the elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group@@ ing options , you only need to use the landing field at the end of the rule and then use the button group . the options then look like this : &quot;
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flickr did not listed ? the free space is limited there on 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in the full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I was mainly interested in &amp; checking ; s concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason why one is using a paint @-@ managed work@@ flow , using the colors that can be photographed by your camera or scanner . with a color@@ managed work@@ flow you can reach that the colors on your monitor those from your camera or scanner and the colors that you can print or publish in the Web to those from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the topic comes to colour administration , everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results that he wants . unfortunately , you should make links with deeper information about colour administration . in addition , links with deeper information allow you to make your own informed choices to make you get the results you want . &quot;
&quot; if your work@@ work@@ flow meets all six of the criteria listed below , then you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ R@@ GB kit . ( more information can be found below )
their only other ima@@ gery is by e @-@ mail or the web where s@@ R@@ GB of de @-@ facto standard is .
&quot; so if so R@@ GB works so well and makes life for everybody to do so easy , why should one use another color foam and have to think about color @-@ administr@@ ations ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limits of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colors that we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ fi@@ ery region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger farms so visit Bruce Lin@@ d@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente page and click on Info and then on Information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I need to cal@@ cite my monitor if I decided to work for it only in the s@@ R@@ GB ?
&quot; yes ! whether you are working on the s@@ R@@ GB kit or not , you need to work your monitor cal@@ li@@ cky , since s@@ R@@ GB works cap@@ sul@@ ated that your ; on@@ itor on s@@ R@@ GB works , then you have to use either your monitor on the s@@ R@@ GB standard , a fitting monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before starting a further manual processing . &quot;
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize the same , automatic , and contrast extend from the menu pol@@ ishing Autom@@ atic correction automatically try out of your colours the best . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize this method the leu@@ st@@ ank levels over the whole picture , so that the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ gh@@ test point is as bright as possible without its shade . this feature is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark , or washed out . &quot;
&quot; same : this method j@@ us@@ hed the lumin@@ aire factor of the colors of the selected image , so that the h@@ isto@@ gram of the Inten@@ sity Array will be as flat as possible . thus , it achieves very good results in enhancing the contrasts of an image , sometimes it produces only garbage . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in an image or destroy it . &quot;
&quot; automatic abbrevi@@ ation : this method maxim@@ izes the shade area in the red , green and blue channel . you select the dark and bright bor@@ der@@ h@@ ues and j@@ us@@ hes the red , green and blue channels on the complete h@@ isto@@ gram . &quot;
contrast : this method enhances the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values on the greatest possible area and a re@@ ji@@ usti@@ fication of all values in between . this is only visible in winding images and can be a good correction for poor photos .
the whi@@ ch@@ id off &amp; checking came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white @-@ off of a photo .
&quot; the whi@@ ch@@ equ@@ als correction is slightly limited since over a color foam with 8 @-@ bit per colour . if you can perform too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure occur . in case you are working in the white mode automatically , your options for correction is better . &quot;
&quot; this tool is based on a whi@@ pping @-@ like rhythm of the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym is protected . you can start it via the menu @-@ entry colors of whit@@ eboard . &quot;
&quot; the preview window can be adapted in size . on the left side , both the original image and the preview of the target image . the preview is dynam@@ ically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original whit@@ eboard immediately , then it is enough to click the window . &quot;
the preview of the target pictures has a red mark@@ er . the wi@@ dens of the pixel under this mark@@ er is shown as vertical line in the h@@ isto@@ gram .
&quot; on the right above , a h@@ isto@@ gram is shown that dynam@@ ically is changed when you change one parameter . this h@@ isto@@ gram is very helpful because even in well illuminated images , most pixels have very small lam@@ umin@@ ous values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colours or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shade of the shade allows you to improve the shadow details of your photos or also down . &quot;
&quot; to track An@@ stat on the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image show around the color temperature of the white @-@ line . in this way , the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white @-@ off with the list of preferences . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator raises the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. you will display the combined result in the white @-@ wire . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
&quot; the buttons save as well as loading make exactly this . every setting of the whit@@ eboard you have set , you can save it in a text file and load later . &quot;
the button pre@@ dict@@ ates all fil@@ ings back to their standard values and the corresponding neutral white @-@ comparison . note that even neutral settings can be shown another photo as your original . if you save it your original image will change .
&quot; here you can set the enco@@ ders per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit co@@ ding is the widespread JP@@ EG format , 16 @-@ bit co@@ ding is better for high @-@ quality pictures . this co@@ ding needs also more disk space , dat@@ ures and DN@@ G are available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and DN@@ G . &quot;
&quot; this tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw material . it uses the change and assignment of color @-@ filtering . color @-@ mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the hel@@ mets . a detailed guide for the use of color profiles can be added to the section color administration . &quot;
&quot; another important tool is available in the menu under colors audio correc@@ tions . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always do the same mistake . in the manual for sound correction , you will find more information . &quot;
a very powerful way exposure to correc@@ ting problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; digi@@ tization came ; tool Far@@ ming effects poses four color effects , a solar @-@ effect effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a c@@ ten@@ filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing was Solar@@ arization , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect of being developed when one developed partially developed printing a short flash light and afterwards the development of the picture were inver@@ ted . the result was a partial neg@@ atively of the picture . this tool allows you to fine this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar isation . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what chem@@ ically possible is possible . another increase is finally generated a neg@@ ativity that is not to produce on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . &quot;
this is an example of solar production . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this is processed ( 2 ) . the intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it is distinguished from a satur@@ ation by making the colors brilliant and glo@@ wing . try it simple , it em@@ bell@@ ishes many photos . &quot;
&quot; Vel@@ via is the brand name for one on day@@ light optimized opposite color movie produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ movie . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot . the characteristics make him a film of choice for natural photography . also , the characteristics make him a mixture of photographers , especially those that barely distinguish landscapes . &quot;
&quot; the ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates Ne@@ on@@ light on the contrasts . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repeat the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . with large images the filter the filter the whole CPU can be rel@@ ieve for a moment . &quot;
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to correct the color counter and the lumin@@ osity of the photo . you can to experiment the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result you can use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
&quot; if you can make a picture at bad light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : one too big satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation will be a good choice for satur@@ ation instead of increasing them . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple leu@@ ka@@ b / contrast / g@@ amma is the tool of sound correction for improving the exposure . although the dialog on this tool seems very complicated , you need only the area of shooting . more concrete the three sliding steps below the h@@ isto@@ gram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of the Inten@@ sity values , a h@@ isto@@ gram , of the active channel or the selected area . under the graph three sliding into the ones are clicked and the left side represents the dark ones and the right side represents the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the regul@@ ator and look back on how the picture changes .
&quot; on the right hand side , the original and preview of the picture can be seen . the preview is dynam@@ ically , based on the settings of the picture . on the left , the following options are available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be adjusted if the h@@ isto@@ gram is shown with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for pictures of a digital camera is often the linear display is dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic H@@ isto@@ gram is used by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic form is useful .
&quot; three regul@@ ators : the top one for the dark notes , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle notes , often called Gam@@ et@@ values . &quot;
&quot; the three colour brush can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically j@@ us@@ p@@ ate the shade , middle and bright notes automatically . in addition , there is one button for an fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
exit status : the outputs allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to evaluate the exit status as for example . compression of the exec@@ utable can be used for example to create a slight picture as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
&quot; automatically : with this button , the values are automatically set depending on the intention of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and loading : with these buttons , the values stored in the file system can be saved and later loaded , the Gimp levels format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input will automatically be rev@@ oked for all shade , means and Sunday . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image of the h@@ isto@@ grams for red , green , blue , and the lam@@ umin@@ ous channels . &quot;
the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator that means you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s not a effect to see the final result .
&quot; below you can see an example of the adjustment of the input data applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha Channel , as well as the outputs are unchanged . the original image is with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left , half of the original will appear and the target picture appears . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
&quot; Modi@@ fied Channel : this comb@@ o allows the channel to enter , which is changed by the module : &quot;
&quot; besides this cas@@ ket , two symbols will be changed to switch between linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . in this case , linear mode is the most useful . for pictures with large areas of constant colour generates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a short section to the right , for example the bright notes , then you can see that these bright shades with darker filling up and the associated image pixels are darker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos a red mark@@ er is to be seen . if you want to change this mark@@ er to the area you want to change , an appropriate line is displayed on the curve that is the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is j@@ us@@ hed to your taste . &quot;
save as and charging : with these buttons you can make exactly this . any curve that you have created can hereby be saved in the file system and later loaded . the file format is the Gimp cures .
&quot; if you create this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes buttons , you automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and Sundays . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image for the rot@@ or , green , blue , and lam@@ umin@@ ous curve . &quot;
the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels you get the combined result . this is an indicator that means you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s not a effect to see the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ white photo that was corrected in L@@ umin@@ anz@@ canal . Schatten@@ - and Sonn@@ y was applied with the color p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the correc@@ t@@ ner ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of &amp; checking came ; picture editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photos .
the channel mix@@ er is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of picture editing .
with the can@@ al@@ op@@ tionally box you can select the color for the h@@ isto@@ gram : this gives you a first notice how to correct the channels by clicking the relative distribution and swing . the left pane of the window will show you a preview . the original can be viewed as compared to your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the picture a vertical line in the h@@ isto@@ gram appears to show you the relevant colour value .
&quot; controls for the module are right below : regul@@ ator for red , green and building allow you to mix these channels . if you activate the appropriate color components , as the channel bl@@ ender is then a tool for creating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ um@@ rom , the reduction of a color leads to a visible spac@@ er that occurs from the dy@@ es . colour consists of small smokers which do not appear at the same place in the shade . if that is the case , you can reduce your mon@@ och@@ re conversion in which you can reduce the color@@ fulness first . &quot;
saving as well as loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting can be saved for later and then load it . this used file format is the Gimp channel mix@@ er format .
the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator that means you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s not a effect to see the final result .
below you can see a photo in which blue channel is rec@@ ted . the option L@@ umin@@ anz is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstr@@ action . the development of digital photography is black / white a working step as color pictures can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film @-@ tape profiles .
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3@@ 200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford H@@ P@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P@@ 2 Super &quot;
green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lin@@ sen@@ filter . this looks good at all the scene pictures and fits particularly well with portraits of the sky . thus similar to the 00@@ 4 c@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange fil@@ tered : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter . this enhances landscapes , maritime scenes and air @-@ photos . thus similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange fil@@ tered . &quot;
Rot@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lin@@ sen@@ filter . this creates a dramatic up@@ swing effect and can simul@@ ate moon gli@@ ders to day @-@ time . thus similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lin@@ sen@@ filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : generates warm bright and medium tones while he adds a bit of cold in the leaves . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
&quot; with the &amp; checking , tool texture can be used to apply decorative textures to an image . &quot;
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop @-@ portrait of enlarged points , or like a wall image on a wall . the menu item image texture uses image editing can be used for it . &quot;
relative : shift this parameter to the right raises the light of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture on the picture .
a paper text @-@ toge@@ ther@@ ing has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief is set to 200 .
&quot; with the &amp; checking , tool frame may add a decorative frame to add a picture . &quot;
keeping the eye of a be@@ holder in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to sc@@ end eye . under picture frame the module can be added from the image processing .
&quot; type : with this parameter you set the desired visual type for your image . elaborate the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounded it with a cute line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , Ab@@ du@@ mb@@ et surrounded it with a cute three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative adds a zi@@ pped frame with patterns . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is from 1 % to 50 % limited .
&quot; the target image will be bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the pictures , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can easily insert a form@@ at@@ ted text in an image to any location . this also goes to multiple sites if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with the mouse . use text output , orientation , color from the color foam and the character set with its properties as you need . you &apos;ll simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ sighted background . the image is already finished . &quot;
&quot; any setting that you chose for your text may be altered until you press the button &quot; OK , &quot; after the image has been stored once , the text is part of the picture . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; checking , tool Sch@@ abl@@ one can apply a template via a picture . &quot;
the menu image template uses in image processing can be used to put sten@@ cils over one image .
&quot; for the sten@@ cil there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , you need to add the P@@ NG file format and should connect with maximum compres@@ sing ( 9 ) to reduce the file size . if you checking your template , send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; checking ; mailing list , checking @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for first time , you need to put your shot @-@ folder with the button base folder in dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the bow@@ ls . these settings will be noted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder has been released for the sten@@ cil , a super@@ visor , which reflects the folder structure of the Sch@@ ab@@ lon@@ en@@ ord@@ al . selecting a folder , updated the preview of the sten@@ cils automatically . &quot;
under the preview are three buttons where you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button magni@@ fied the pic@@ torial image . it is centered to the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; down@@ size : this button res@@ ized the underlying picture . it is centered to the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to drag the image according to the mouse button . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
shift : use this button to move the image below the template . take the picture and insert it at the desired position .
&quot; if you want to apply the template , you want to apply the template , the image will then be automatic to the preview size . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization came ; put three different tools to the field of shar@@ pen@@ ing , each of you has advantages in other areas . &quot;
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ed is a traditional tool to sharp@@ ness . it is very fast and simple , but produces particularly in dark areas , gra@@ ined images . &quot;
sharp@@ ness mask works at the contrast of edges to look a picture shar@@ per . in fact it &apos;s no bit more psych@@ ovis@@ ual to remove it and it &apos;s a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
&quot; focus is perhaps the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjustment . &quot;
photos without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ zed images need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . these elements are smaller than the resolution will thus observe a little bl@@ ur . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are displayed on paper . SL@@ R cameras usually need more resili@@ ent than normal cameras for the private user .
&quot; with JP@@ EG &apos;s images it is often applied to a camera internal sharp@@ ness . images in the blank format , on the other hand , must always be wel@@ ded during the processing . &quot;
&quot; some scanner give a sharp@@ ness filter already during the reading of the image . if you turn off , you get the control of your image . &quot;
in some situations you can get useful results by drawing a photo with the edge @-@ throwing de@@ pot . that allows you to call with the menu @-@ entry corro@@ sive sharp@@ ness .
&quot; however , you should not deal with caution because the results do not seem very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases the edge of edges , but ampli@@ fying the noise . in general , the viable technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing an image re@@ focus . you can achieve more information about the menu entry into the menu . below , you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ acking . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it sharp@@ ens . use the tool for soft signs with the menu item to reloc@@ ate sof@@ tening and experiment with settings . the showcase on the right of the dialogue shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter bl@@ ur@@ red is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help you edit the image . the preview window shows the issue of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values create good results and should initially be tried out . an increase in radius or viewing will ampli@@ fy the effect . if you get the sharp@@ ness mask too strongly , Rau@@ e and get the impression of gra@@ ding in the proximity of sharp edges . &quot;
&quot; the radius marks how many pixels on each side of a c@@ ann@@ te is affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i , so they should therefore shar@@ pen pictures best in their final resolution . &quot;
&quot; the amount marks the percentage between the original and the wi@@ red image added to the original , and thereby the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot;
&quot; the swelling value is a break from the maximum R@@ GB value and the difference of difference . it can therefore be applied to a minimum difference between the tones of shar@@ pen@@ ing of shar@@ pen@@ ing shar@@ ps , therefore beauty defects in face , heavenly and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the un@@ sharp mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the converted image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mask was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a corpor@@ a value = 0.@@ 0 . &quot;
the &amp; checking came ; tool re@@ focus on a picture by improving the edge of the sharp@@ ness . it used to use the copyright protected filter by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to und@@ o a picture &amp; quot ; re@@ focused quot ; in which it is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tering . this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . you can start it from the menu by drawing colors re@@ focused in image processing .
&quot; in practice the circular fin works far better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung has a very long tail , which brings the mathematical outcome also from the source pixel , which is far from the original pixel . the F@@ IR Wiener in@@ verse is in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixel . that causes unwanted results . &quot;
circular edge sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular fin . it is the most important parameter for using this module . it is the most important parameter for use of this module . you can put a higher value if your image is very bl@@ ur@@ red but then take note on Heiligen@@ pons .
correlation : a boost in correlation can help to reduce ar@@ te@@ facts . the correlation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values nearby 1 , &amp; eg . 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ ness effect of the module .
&quot; smoking filter : an increase in the filter filter can help you reduce ar@@ te@@ facts . the filter may accept values of 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 is rarely helpful . if the filter quality is too low . a viable value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will still be imp@@ aired . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should let this value on 0 to prevent annoying ar@@ te@@ facts . if you use a value unauthorized zero , so you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; the size of the matrix size : this value determines the size of the transform@@ ation@@ ary rix . an increase in the mat@@ ress size can produce good results , especially if you select great values for the circular edge or the Gau@@ de &apos;s sharp@@ ness . however , note that the module is very slow when you select large values for these parameters . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
the saving as well as loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any re@@ focus parameters you have set will be stored for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all the cuts in color and Inten@@ se monitors on the picture before using the module .
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before selecting the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , which leave later unpleasant ar@@ te@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JP@@ EG , you should apply the module to the un@@ zi@@ pped image . &quot;
&quot; generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results as a sharp@@ ness . this could be caused by the bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighborhood used as a sharp@@ ness . &quot;
theoretically have to be bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ is@@ sing always arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never be the effect of in@@ sharp@@ ness . for the Wiener filter you can show that it &apos;s the optimal linear filter . practical is the result of the F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters is always at least as good as the im@@ sharp@@ ness mask . the F@@ IR Wiener filters is often better in processing small details .
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small in@@ focused picture : &quot;
the original un@@ sharp color picture has to be corrected . this picture was made using a analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the Auto @-@ Focus Lin@@ se .
&quot; for further information on the methods for the edge of the field of content in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
the regul@@ ator covers the sharp@@ ness of the area that was bl@@ acked out to generate a more natural sequ@@ el .
&quot; color tin@@ ts allows a customized color for the pump . if you want a blue eyes instead of dark , you can adjust it here . &quot;
the tool image correction is one of the most far developed tools to not remove desired ar@@ te@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the algorithm algorithm was developed by the IMA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various preference settings as set @-@ points to simplify the restoration . the available settings are en@@ umer@@ ated below :
in case you want to use the filter settings fine you can use the rider smooth@@ ing and advanced settings .
&quot; detail con@@ notation &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to an even@@ ly smooth@@ ness over the picture . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be sharp . please note that no shar@@ pen@@ ance is needed to be sub@@ ordin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; direct value dependent Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value is spread even@@ ly in all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film bas@@ kets or C@@ CD ru@@ bles will create a high value of wave @-@ like patterns . JP@@ EG arti@@ facts will best use a value close to 1 . &quot;
&quot; &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this puts the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all else@@ . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . put this value suitable for the degree of smoke in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is considered larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is done , as it is difficult to produce the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
repeat : returns to how often the algorithm is going through . normally , here is 1 or 2 out . &quot;
&quot; Win@@ kel@@ o @-@ wide da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ en Alpha . if Alpha is small chosen , there should also be small chosen . so note that small corner should generate a long run time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral step &#91; 0,@@ 1 , 10 &#93; : integral step into pixels . you should avoid the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixels smooth@@ ing and never greater than 2 . &quot;
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the More An quality you receive by selecting this option is low . it doubles but the term . we recommend it to allow him .
the buttons save as well as charging make exactly this . any setting of image errors can be saved into a text file and later be loaded later .
image failure is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can take a very long time and take a high CPU load . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button break .
below you can see how picture mistake with little ar@@ te@@ facts can be corrected . the module is made in a photo that was created in Guatemala city with a an@@ alogue camera . as you see there is a peculiar black fact that was created by a bad film storage during the journey . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ tization came ; smoking reduction is a powerful tool to decrease bil@@ dr@@ au@@ ts . it uses a protected algorithm by Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides a sel@@ ectable image filter to remove spots and other arti@@ facts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensory noises from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ ally ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about sensors of digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the scre@@ enshot shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and a high standard sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ de@@ ous noise which can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you only need the sub@@ window details and the window window advanced settings may remain with default settings .
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time that the filter is needed per pixel and the image is bl@@ ur@@ red through the radius and the color in it is ra@@ gged and thus smaller faults . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controlled the pixel level . this value sets the pixel filter to a front . if it is lifted up , it will change the edges filter . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter details can no longer receive and noise or lubric@@ ate occurs once again . &quot;
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong can not occur the whole noise or spac@@ eship can occur . put it on a value close to the maximum when you want to remove a watch@@ man or JP@@ EG arti@@ facts want to lose without any details .
&quot; lumin@@ ance : controls the illumin@@ ance of the picture . we recommend you either color or light density , to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process which is controlled by the details -@@ settings . &quot;
color : controlled the color intolerance of the picture . we recommend you either color or light density to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process which is controlled by the details -@@ settings .
&quot; Gamma : controls the gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ ancy of the picture . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ able levels of the darker areas , which are typically stronger , but it also lubric@@ ates the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; absorption : controls the adjustment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ atter@@ ing absorption . this value is defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filtering radius is responding to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is lifted up , the edges may appear to occur . he can remove spac@@ ecraft and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter to the edges . he can remove spac@@ ecraft and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
&quot; storing and charging : these buttons are used exactly for it . all parameters for the noise reduction , which you have set , can be stored into the fil@@ esystem and later loaded . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of how smoking reduction can change your lives . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the correc@@ tive with ( 2 ) , which was applied with default settings . &quot;
sometimes a picture is cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use it with the smooth@@ ness . the showcase on the right side of the dialogue shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the digi@@ tization came ; photo rest@@ or@@ ation is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo products .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s Rau@@ l , scr@@ ap@@ ing , scrat@@ ches , compression @-@ ar@@ te@@ ed and local bugs that emerge in digital , original or retro@@ actively digi@@ ti@@ zed pictures . the smooth@@ ing is done along the image and therefore maintains the content as well as the human eye . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and text color . the algorithm for restoration is carried out using a different tool , the image error correction , the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ ches and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; JP@@ EG arti@@ facts reduce : the compression of JP@@ EG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a los@@ sy com@@ pres@@ sion@@ ist com@@ ic quot ; - small standards that are to be seen in un@@ zi@@ pped image . this attitude is intended to correct these problems . &quot;
the buttons Save as and Download exactly this . every setting of photo rest@@ or@@ ation can be saved into a text file and later be loaded .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can take a very long time and take a high CPU load . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b button .
below you can reduce like a photo with like @-@ shaped noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film bas@@ kets in the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time textures was reduced to an old paint photo that was used with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts that were created by the Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; checking came ; tool Hot@@ pixels allows hot@@ pixel of photos that have a C@@ CD camera , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project which are protected by Martin Dick@@ im . &quot;
&quot; bright , t@@ ote or hot pixel are particularly at high @-@ quality raw material photos a problem since many cameras with JP@@ EG compression over a built @-@ in repression for hot pixels . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; in a photo with a dark picture substitution method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel . &quot;
download this file into the wizard with the button dark . the tool will recognize automatic the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image show .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important to discover the dark picture directly after having new hot or bright pixel through C@@ CD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark picture to the correc@@ tive image . note that the wizard will notice the last dark picture and re@@ charges this automatically at the next session . &quot;
the image area and the preview help you correct the results within the picture . the showcase shows the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pixel are taken up in all pre@@ views .
choose an area around the broken pixels on the preview and see the results of the filter . select afterwards the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ l these pixels . these are the filters available :
&quot; average : it is identified an average of the neighbor pixel . the resulting color will be assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 of the Pix@@ el@@ block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ish the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard fil@@ ter@@ method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to Pix@@ el@@ block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ish the pixels in the block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to charge a bi @-@ Cub@@ an surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cub@@ an curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ish the broken pixels in the block .
&quot; below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image was increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is under ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ ti@@ fication correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image . &quot;
&quot; vast@@ ness objective , especially the medium and large photo format , especially the whole sensor area can not be illuminated even@@ ly . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and margins of the picture by using the light that achieves the sensor there . tele@@ bi@@ es also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; but he also has cons . many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 at Bl@@ en@@ den@@ filter , which should be the necessary dis@@ closing time under circumstances so that it is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . vast@@ ness objective , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise un@@ sharp@@ ness effects arise through motion . &quot;
&quot; with the great popularity of today &apos;s film and shades of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a c@@ enter@@ filter by creating an equivalent transformation on a blank , which is applied without this filter . the tool of Vig@@ enter@@ filter is applied to a picture . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . &quot;
with three types you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three more exposure of the target image .
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of lighting the highest density at the point of the greatest density . the default density is 2,@@ 0 , resulting in a optical filter with a bl@@ ending height of 1 , or by chance to compens@@ ate for a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ osity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : the editing of an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the ligh@@ tness of the pixels . you need to re@@ configure the exposure of the target image with these options as you need to only increase positive values as you just need to increase settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a more subtle contamination of the target of the target , let the values for ligh@@ tness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; checking came ; picture editing from the menu color gra@@ dation . &quot;
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction to an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the correc@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the correc@@ tive image . a leu@@ ka@@ increased image correction was also performed with the image using this tool .
the digi@@ tization came ; Lin@@ sen@@ distor@@ tion is a tool to correct the impact of cel@@ estial lenses on photos . it uses a copyright protected by David Ho@@ dson .
&quot; this tool works with geomet@@ ric distor@@ tions . Color@@ less distor@@ tions can not be corrected with this tool . &quot;
the co@@ efficient of the second engra@@ ver treated the general geomet@@ ric version of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or conve@@ x form of the picture .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third Gra@@ des has a similar circular effect , fla@@ p but on edges . this correction is not used in the tool . &quot;
the co@@ efficient fourth Gra@@ des corrected the remote corners opposite of the second gra@@ des . if you combine these two can be eliminated any geomet@@ rical distor@@ tion .
&quot; generally , this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion second gra@@ des . with negative values , ton@@ ular distor@@ tions can be corrected , and positive values of kis@@ sed distor@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion fourth Gra@@ des . this value seems to be stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners parameter set the opposite sign of the parameter . &quot;
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thus leads to the first Gra@@ des through . negative values enlarge while positive the image is smaller .
ligh@@ tening : this value j@@ us@@ ys the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values they increase .
&quot; to help you find the best filtering settings , illustrated the dialog with a preview for correc@@ ting correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used when the next start is used as standard values . &quot;
&quot; the ton@@ ic or cus@@ hion correction should be performed before all of the cutting or size changes . at the best , you perform this correction as all the first . in case you perform a picture anew , the effect would be apparent . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool presents a vertical and a horizontal auxiliary line . move it into an important place , such as the sea side or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the ton@@ ic / kis@@ sed distor@@ tion with the help of the lines . &quot;
if you correct a kis@@ sed distor@@ tion the resulting picture will have black corners . you can trans@@ duce them with the das@@ hing tool in the menu trans@@ duc@@ ing out of the picture editing or over the zoom controller of this dialog .
&quot; for most images the ton@@ shaped correction is made . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs , such as recordings from the front , frame and painting , it is the perspective so to correct the angle at the picture 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with the hand you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the ton@@ ical correction to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method of simul@@ ating infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ cu@@ u.@@ org web site which is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ a movie . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left @-@ hand side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rec@@ tan@@ gle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can adjust two parameters set film bas@@ kets and cinem@@ atic ( ISO ) . enable the option to simul@@ ate film bas@@ kets as you simul@@ ate the gran@@ ate texture of a highly sensitive movie . the ISO regul@@ ator changes the amount of film bas@@ kets and the dominance of colour green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in the conversion . green meadows are white as snow !
&quot; because the filter color channels for reproduce of infrared film , especially the green channel does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as the dy@@ es are missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared fil@@ um@@ my applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the converted picture under ( 2 ) . higher standard values create a kind of au@@ ra in the cutting edge .
&quot; the digi@@ tization also came ; filter film@@ maker is an easy to use tool to reproduce film bas@@ kets on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , . to increase the sensitivity of the movies , the manufacturer &apos;s great silver gra@@ ins of the phot@@ em@@ ul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film coverage effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere of detached from daily life . in case you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street photography , gran@@ ular sight especially in your mono@@ chro@@ matic photographs , so you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regul@@ ator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the gra@@ ins . the default value is , although frequently higher values need to be adjusted to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more gra@@ ins , you can use the filter multiple times . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the film narrative effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) , and the edited the ( 2 ) . the used film @-@ sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 . &quot;
the digi@@ tization came ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; checking came ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting . nature lovers and styles are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two regul@@ ators for influ@@ encing this effect . the top sel@@ ects the Pin@@ sel@@ size between one and five out . thicker brus@@ hes are better suited for big pictures . smooth , the smooth@@ ness or , from the other side is considered , the arti@@ fact . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the be@@ worked with the ( 2 ) . Pin@@ sel@@ size for this 640 pixels wide picture is 1 and Smo@@ tte 17 .
&quot; the digi@@ tization has been used ; filter coal @-@ drawing uses color and Inten@@ sity gra@@ dient to define a coher@@ ent image . these lines , which change the outlines in the drawing , are emphasized . pictures of whose gra@@ dients have slowly change to outline you . this would be good pictures to start with it . &quot;
there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper controller chooses the foundation size and the lower j@@ us@@ ys the contrast ( smooth@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the carbon filter filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be improved by adapting the intensity .
&quot; the digi@@ tization came ; filter engra@@ ving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was st@@ amped in watch@@ making . it uses a protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization was a fast tool to give your pictures again with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well in pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing in the content . the filter uses the differences between colour and intensity , in order to turn the image into a gray , mon@@ ary landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to set the contrast to filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default . &quot;
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the depth used is 10 % .
this filter group allows you to transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of distor@@ tion effects . it uses protected algorithms of pi@@ ers Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and lets it look as if it is seen through glass blocks .
&quot; wave @-@ blocks 2 : an@@ alogue to the wave @-@ blocks 1 , the image is distorted here with a different version of glass blocks . &quot;
&quot; some effects need long time for the calculation , and create a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button end . &quot;
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of un@@ sharp@@ ness effects . it uses protected algorithms of pi@@ ed Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ped the picture along the ern@@ fo@@ erde lines that go from a center . this simul@@ ates a zo@@ oming camera and thus generates a dynamic expression of often in the sport photography .
radi@@ al in@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ red the image by rotation of the pixels to make a focal point . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a revol@@ ving camera .
removing in@@ sharp@@ ness : caught the picture to create the effect of a not focused camera lens . the object seems to step back in the background .
&quot; movement sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ped the picture by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a linear movements , z : B : from one car or train to photographed , camera . &quot;
soft tip o@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ped the picture soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny reflec@@ tive focus ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ or photos or to add a warm and subtle light . &quot;
scar@@ fs : wi@@ ped the picture by random shift of pixels and simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent shar@@ per : find the color @-@ bas@@ ins in the picture and caught them without changing the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it , by filling with an average pixel value . &quot;
&quot; some effects need long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time with the kno@@ b button . &quot;
the shelf drops are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your image . this gives it natural your pictures a unique appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected by protected algorithm .
trou@@ gh size allows to change the size of the drop . since the dro@@ plet size is not growing automatically with the size of the image . number changes the number and density of drops . fish changes the optical effect of drop in the picture .
&quot; you can start with the digi@@ tization ; picture editing a section free of shelves . use the selection tool to choose the area , for example a face , which should remain free . if you start the filter regul@@ ator , the area will remain free of rain drops . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the rain drop , the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the converted image ( 2 ) points a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example . &quot;
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirrors or rotating in the right orientation . the tools for this can be found in the menu Transform@@ ate rotating or Transform@@ ations . &quot;
photo bub@@ bles is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
&quot; to reduce a picture is simple . the big question is how you can blow up an image and bl@@ ends the details ? how can you get the missing information back ? how can you get the missing information back or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g @-@ algorithm that is used here , try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select to change the size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below to see .
&quot; the tool for size change a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approach the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try to blow up the tool . &quot;
many image processing programs use some kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation . e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; checking came ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm has been developed by the IMA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you have to say the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below :
&quot; aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained in the input of the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is considered larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is done , as it is difficult to produce the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; the buttons Save as and loading are used exactly to it . any inser@@ tion for photo , can be saved as a text file , and later be loaded . &quot;
&quot; photo bub@@ bles is very fast in what it makes , but it can take a very long time and take a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b button . &quot;
you can see below an example of photo bub@@ bles by adding a small color picture on the double size . the original ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement to compare .
&quot; cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery , but also a commonly underestimated tool for creating a picture . the image processing allows you to create a photo with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag the rec@@ tan@@ gle , you &apos;ll see this rec@@ tan@@ gle then you see the mouse move . &quot;
&quot; when you start the mouse off , the area of the photos will be cut off . thus you can change the size of the picture after cutting . a new rec@@ tan@@ gle you can simply drag on the corners of the rec@@ tan@@ gle . a new rec@@ tan@@ gle by clicking it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you are satisfied with the plug @-@ in button , use the button &apos; button &apos; button in the tool@@ bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file save or save file save in the menu file to save the new cro@@ pped photo . &quot;
&quot; in the fores@@ try area , you can change the size of the rec@@ tan@@ gle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue will be preserved . &quot;
&quot; in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a high format or cross format . in the high format is always assigned to the larger value of height and in the cross @-@ format of the width . &quot;
&quot; the tool for aspect ratio is using a relative aspect ratio . that means that it is always the same , regardless of whether you use centimeters , ink or any other physical size . you can e.g. see a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to set the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
&quot; at the bottom of the dialog , you can set up with the max . relation to the range of cutting to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool for aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are stored as standard values depending on the orientation . the modified image measurements are reflected in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cro@@ pped image and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the setup assistance can help you avoid , so that you can put your pictures better together . these help are : &quot;
harmon@@ ic Tri@@ angle : harmon@@ ics are based on the principle of similarity . like the third @-@ party gels , harmon@@ ic triangles are a possibility to divide a rec@@ tan@@ gle into a similarly harmonious tri@@ plet to the di@@ ag@@ onal . &quot;
&quot; Golden center : the golden middle is a division that is divided into various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us pussy , or the bl@@ isters of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all kinds of things that we feel beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the Golden division is the ir@@ rational figure 1,@@ 6@@ 18@@ 0@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used in the ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to build your temple and p@@ yrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the Golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acci sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 13 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 and etc . &quot;
the golden middle represents the liquid rep@@ lic@@ as if you put an image . these help are en@@ umer@@ ated below :
&quot; the Golden Spir@@ als will make you get closer to your destination good results for your photos . compared to third @-@ party levels , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that crosses the eye on the line of the spiral , creating a symm@@ etric visual flow on this species . &quot;
&quot; a further rule are the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called Golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . it should give something that the eye is at the center of the composition . it should be a line or different objects . this something can be just there without the eye , it will fulfil its task . &quot;
the golden h@@ edge also deri@@ ve from the above @-@ discussed golden spiral . their verti@@ ces are the middle points of the golden h@@ edge . observe this in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles are no equivalent triangles . di@@ ag@@ onal to place these lines can be a static object more dynamic . &quot;
&quot; if you use golden triangles to break up your frame , create an effect of professional photographers with Dynamic Sy@@ mm@@ et@@ rics . try your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can not reach any other way . &quot;
the options horizontal reflect and Ver@@ tically reflect are used to mirror the harmonious divisions .
with the button color you can set the color of the relief lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast the aid lines can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rot@@ ate an image at any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo , then it happens easily that you are not exactly ver@@ tically or horizont@@ ally . this creates an image in which the things turned around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; checking ; picture editing and the tool free rotation . select this transformation free rotation and j@@ us@@ p@@ ate the destination angle . &quot;
&quot; turn your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der is set in degrees . with the button preference , you can set the sli@@ der back to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right side . &quot;
&quot; for your help , the module protects a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the image show around the two lines . after you fix it over an important point of the picture , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now j@@ us@@ p@@ ate the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
once you have shot a picture you will find unwanted @-@ tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to fix this is to use the feature transform@@ ers out of the picture editing .
an elegant way to cut the image is Autom@@ atically cutting . select one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing takes the picture a bit after rotation . however please note the above warning .
all per@@ tin@@ tive transformations are performed to a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically calculated . on the right of the dialogue you will find some information which will help you change the perspective :
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty fields created by the transformation , in pixel . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty fields created by the transformation , in pixel . &quot;
angle left at the top : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle on the right side : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area .
angle on the right bottom : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adapting the perspective the picture becomes a little spar@@ ed . for a single adaptation this effect is small , but two adjustments produce a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adapted the perspective , you get in@@ deli@@ ble holes of the corners . a possibility to ber@@ some it is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers out of the picture editing . &quot;
&quot; the control tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part in the opposite . a horizontal string , e.g. , the upper part of the image is distorted . with other words , a rec@@ tan@@ gle becomes transformed into a parall@@ elo@@ gram . you can launch this module via transform@@ ers . &quot;
drag your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . you can press horizontal and ver@@ tically at the same time . if you press on preference . a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target are shown on the right of the thumb@@ nail .
&quot; your assistance will be a vertical and a horizontal line . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the control tool to j@@ us@@ ze your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have carried out the s@@ hafts , the picture becomes a bit wi@@ ped out . for a single sh@@ elling this effect is usually neglected but two certi@@ fications generate twice as much bl@@ ur@@ ring and hence you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to eliminate it is to cut the picture with transformation , cut off the picture editing . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization came ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write pictures . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been comp@@ iles . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of picture formats with &amp; checking . &quot;
&quot; because of this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , you will always find JP@@ EG and TI@@ FF underneath . &quot;
&quot; checking came , only files in formats we know . this happens based on the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list . you can modify this list of file exten@@ tions and checking it . in the section configuration you can find more information . &quot;
&quot; nearly all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JP@@ EG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you to select even the user @-@ user format . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; checking , supports both formats . &quot;
image compression is the application of data compression procedures to digital images . thereby redund@@ ant information is reduced to save this way the bil@@ dd@@ ates on a more efficient way .
&quot; JP@@ EG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ other results as JP@@ EG with the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also be saving , if specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the raw material format , you can read from Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Folk and Cambridge in Col@@ our very useful instructions in English . you can convert raw material pictures in JP@@ EG or TI@@ FF with the raw footage of &amp; checking ; in section configuration you will find further information on using modules with &amp; checking . &quot;
&quot; checking came ; supports the store by blan@@ ket only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which was included in &amp; digi@@ . all support cameras can be seen at the bottom of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw materials which came from &amp; checking ; supported : &quot;
&quot; many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often saved in Avi@@ - or MPEG @-@ format . however , this formats understand and will preview for the movies . &amp; checking out ; however , the &amp; k@@ de ; settings to play movies use to launch the program for playback . &quot;

&quot; if you can exchange steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initi@@ ale contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four cuts with the Module of whit@@ eboard . &quot;
many tools you need the photo editing are in &amp; checking ; included . your description follows here .
&quot; all image processing tools such as edge , soft@@ ness , soft@@ ness , re@@ focused , re@@ focused , bl@@ unt , un@@ sharp mask , which indicates the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture applicable ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this step @-@ step shows the status of the filter to the current image . on the left of it five buttons permit to change the compar@@ atively mode of the pre @-@ view mode . these modes are :
ver@@ tically share without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter to the area on the right of the selected range .
horizontal without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper range shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected range .
ver@@ tically share . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal . the upper range shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; style : displays the preview if the mouse is not in the preview , and otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons which you can switch on to display over @-@ and under@@ exposure . these colors can be adjusted in the overall setting page .
( 3 ) : the frame for the preview of Pre@@ view . you can throw this frame with the mouse within the picture and put on the part of the picture you will be looking for . the preview in the left part of the dialog is immediately updated .
&quot; ( 5 ) : in the lower left corner , here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your standard values . all adju@@ sting from the last use of the module will be noticed . &quot;
the side@@ bar features shows the essential information about the selected image and is mostly in@@ explic@@ able . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data originate from EX@@ IF data when these are available .
&quot; this rider represents an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can press with the mouse wheel in or out zo@@ oming , and move it . all the pictures within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course , this requires your images ge@@ o data . &quot;
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for p@@ allets files . the application can be used for editing color pal@@ ettes and for selection and naming of colors .
&quot; the p@@ allets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can either apply to the whole system or just a user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and har@@ med color . &quot;
&quot; in dialog palette , you can select from a list of the installed p@@ allets or search the folder files . &quot;
the cursor is shown in the p@@ allet view as the line . it can be moved by che@@ wing on the area next to a color .
it shows on the colour beside it . the color is described under the p@@ allet view . here the color name can also be changed .
&quot; it can also be used to choose from . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor to there . afterwards , you move the mouse with a pressing left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the crossing field Bei@@ m cursor is activated under the button color , the color is inserted from the color panel on the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write has been selected . this mode can be set by choosing the crossing box below Bei@@ m C@@ ursor . &quot;
&quot; a selection that has been created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions copying , cutting and inser@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; uses the following format for data in cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a poin@@ ter sign , in case another color follows . if there are three num@@ eric values in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; color@@ edit ; &quot;
the colors in the palette and the color selection issue can be drawn with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then select it in the shade on the left .
&quot; graphs are a K@@ DE program for viewing of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graphs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; -@@ program to visu@@ alize graph &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; - programs with only a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; -@@ Project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs through a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; wedge ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graphs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; displays graph with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; wedge ; -@@ program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; on . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; K@@ ate ; and &amp; par@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph in &amp; K@@ ate ; representing the graph ) and in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ;
menu to open the graph in &amp; K@@ ate ; open or to open the graph in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; in a &amp; K@@ ate ; component to open
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems starting from about 1000 knot@@ s and a h@@ ack to represent more than these no@@ des )
&quot; additional needed software : &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; is a &amp; D ; program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs are required . &quot;
&quot; the main window shows the opened graph , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you launch &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; without an argument , the main window is empty like in the bottom scre@@ enshot . in this case the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you selected one or more &amp; dot , the main window looks like in the bottom scre@@ enshot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview of the corner will be displayed when the Grap@@ h is bigger than the palette . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the contex@@ tual menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right at pressing &amp; old ; key ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is restricted in both directions by factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the file has just changed in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; loaded file from another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose if the graph will be re@@ charged or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; you can also remember your decision , so that later it is done . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu item c@@ graphi@@ cally ; set it ... , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you want to open a graph@@ ene outside an ongoing &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; -@@ instance , &amp; eg . in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; -@@ instance , or want to display the lad@@ ders in a sub@@ window of the already ongoing instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option you can save your choice permanently , but also change this with the ordering dialog . &quot;
&quot; in the programme start , you can open all the graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice both and later . &quot;
&quot; you can also specify how the graph should be divided into several pages , the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely . &quot;
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the pieces of the graph that are to be placed on a page , the aspect ratio is ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
Sitemap with one on several pages shared graphs with no head@@ line and with a different font
&quot; the page again covers the possibility to set the behavior when a file has been altered on the hard disk , &amp; eg . from another program . you can set a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore changes ) or the program every time . &quot;
&quot; the site Open gives the possibility to set the behaviour of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; set if a graph will open outside an ongoing meeting ( the graph in a new window , or set in a sub@@ window of already current session ) or determine that every time it is requested . &quot;
the page seat management gives the opportunity to set the program behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; set . you can set a standard behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine at any start afterwards .
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears on one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; will be opened , opens further options : &quot;
here you can choose among different &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as they are described on the website of &amp; graph@@ .@@ z ; are :
&quot; dot . -@@ algorithm , the standard for targeted graph . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered depic@@ tions of targeted graphs . the algorithm places edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few c@@ ann@@ ons as possible . &quot;
the &amp; Ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ ed graph@@ ite . it produces images in accordance with the spring@@ y @-@ model . it is used the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wai @-@ algorithm that is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimension@@ ally sc@@ aling .
&quot; the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm calcul@@ ates a spring@@ board model - layout . it uses the frustration of the purity model , and includes a multi @-@ coating for the treatment of large and ge@@ clu@@ ded graphs . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm calcul@@ ates the node circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and kis@@ sed and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of several cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which then executed by a shell , and the calculated layout of the graph according to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can make special options , or even the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
&quot; determines the type of the graph ( directed or executed ) , and uses the standard algorithms for each type ( dot ; for special , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ favorable graphs ) . &quot;
&quot; if this option is activated , the overview is displayed if this is needed . otherwise it is not displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
displays the What is the -@@ mouse cursor . click with this mouse cursor on a &amp; GUI ; item to get more help to this item ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the basic folder of the repository .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools to display . it takes the following programs :
a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; in the menu Settings you will find more options .
&quot; the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five areas : the main tool@@ bar , the bar for character tools , the status bar , the .@@ colour palette , and the grid network , in which you draw the symbol . &quot;
&quot; if the current file has been changed , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . afterwards , a dialog where you can choose whether the icon will be created by a template or whether you want to start anew . &quot;
&quot; re@@ vert the last revers@@ ed step . if you do not have any step back , this function is disabled . &quot;
adds the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in grey . this can create colors that do not coinci@@ de with those of the symbol range of &amp; k@@ de ; match .
&quot; changes the symbol , but sets the current character color on the color of the point , on which you click . &quot;
&quot; the status bar shows you the current promotions . from left to right , it shows you the X@@ - and y coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current palette , the magni@@ fying factor , and the current number of colors of the symbol . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I Module images to read tools available to read new pictures and to split them .
this module can be used to read and split new data from external sources . currently , two sources can be used : &quot;
&quot; scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supported by SA@@ NE project or another source such as video streams . to this , you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and SA@@ NE . &quot;
&quot; if you scan the menu images below , a dialog that lets you choose between all available sources on your computer . select here the source from which you want to pick up the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by selecting the default values for you to select your picture accordingly . see the preview of your needs before you click with the button scanning the picture . the estimated file size will be displayed in the lower right corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
note that the window is completely displayed as some settings may otherwise be displayed .
&quot; once you have pressed the button scanning , you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to attach the target image appears . here you can select the compression and type of image file . you also need to select the compression and type of image file . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image . &quot;

Flickr is an online photo broadcast on the internet . with Flickr it is possible to show his photos to the people who are an important one . you can show your favorite pictures of the world to show the photos of your camera &apos;s online and show your photos sure and privately to your friends and family around the world .
the module exporting to Flickr can be used to upload pictures from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet .
&quot; if you use the module for first time , you are guided through the process of generating a Tok@@ ens . it is thus quasi your ID . a browser will be started to login to Flickr . &quot;
&quot; after successful login , the module can send pictures to the Flickr website . the following page will be presented after a successful login . &quot;
just close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pushed to Yes you get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr . this will be displayed in the next section .
&quot; if the module is launched to Flickr for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which indicates the current access per@@ missions . the module does not currently support any other per@@ missions . you will not be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions . &quot;
&quot; the button photos should be pushed once again after you have set all the other options . with this button you can select the photos in a file box . if you press the O@@ k button , the upload of the photos to the Flickr server . &quot;
the keywords field can be filled with a separated list of words . these will be added to the picture as keywords during up@@ loading .
&quot; with the options Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie you can adjust the access per@@ missions to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private . &quot;
&quot; when selecting the option to select the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is made from the value added to the maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to set the maximum height of images . the size is altered depending on the aspect ratio .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Gallery @-@ Export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery Export has currently no documentation . in case you are interested in writing this , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants in this list speak English . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module to geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates into the met@@ adata of an image , and the geographical data are stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ key@@ word of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alisation makes tools available to loc@@ alise images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spherical , which is used by GPS and Galileo . height , long@@ itu@@ des and lati@@ tudes are used . &quot;
&quot; to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data , you need a GPS trace as XML file in the g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ p@@ s@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ p@@ sman can download and convert the data to you from your GPS device . &quot;
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can create a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu on . the top to see visual dialog will then load . this file contains naturally data that were recorded at the same time , like the pictures of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when the file is loaded , a automatic correlation is performed and the coordinates are recorded in red . GPS Sp@@ ur@@ data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera will be converted with the time zone . this can be done with the time@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; the adjustment for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives a high devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera protection . if the devi@@ ation from among them are summar@@ ised , the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you have no trace data from one place for pictures you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the difference between 2000 seconds then will cor@@ relate all pictures in this area .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate data . if you know that in reality a loc@@ ating in a big time difference between camera and GPS lies , you can set these limits here and then push the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ishing . &quot;
&quot; coordinates can be set with this dialog manually . this is useful when you have a set of photos at the same place . since the dialog will use the coordinates of one call to the next , you just need to use the button OK to set the data at the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the loc@@ ation can also be found with the shown map and select it . select the relevant region and enlarge it si@@ e.@@ Add this over and over again , the amount must always be selected manually . the card can be changed manually between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are options to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script used to add the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums to a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that can be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set will be UT@@ F @-@ 8 to provide the best possible internation@@ alisation .
the module has four horse@@ men in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab allows you to select all the albums that are exported to HTML . these albums are not shown hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below is the thumb@@ nails and the text that appear in the head of the HTML page .
&quot; the rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this rider is mostly in@@ explic@@ able . the option for each image is created to create a page in which each image is displayed . otherwise , the image is displayed directly with your default image , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show &quot;
&quot; the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your related images . select a folder on which you write to write . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ e Export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JP@@ EG file format , the EX@@ IF @-@ Information of your original images are also stored in the new pictures . &quot;
with other color @-@ depth you can change the standard color@@ less . it also influences the file size . all other settings are explained as well .
&quot; the rider thumb@@ nail shots allows you some of the settings from the album Ri@@ der for the thumb@@ nails , these are small images to be displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a further step window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to break the process .
&quot; when the module has created the pages , the window will not automatically closed . you can therefore read the program @-@ ups to determine if errors occurred during generating . the web browser will be automatically opened at the end to preview the preview of the gallery . press Connect to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I Images is a very fast and flexible OpenGL tool to look at pictures .
the K@@ IP@@ I Bild@@ chter lets you look at a selection of pictures and use on them basic operations such as tor@@ ps , zo@@ oming or reloc@@ ating . the viewer is designed with short @-@ lack and mouse clicks . it was designed for a quick image and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JP@@ EG los@@ s@@ free module is a tool to change images without imp@@ acting your quality .
&quot; this module allows for storing the actions listed below , images in the JP@@ EG format , without the usual losses on quality or met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of the loss of loss is it that clim@@ bs the file size , as no compression of the color is taking place . for example , this is also reflected in the P@@ NG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ client currently has no documentation . in case you are interested in writing this , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants in this list speak English . &quot;

&quot; this function does not work in all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write in any target format . JP@@ EG is supported by writing . please check ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ fier module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a box .
&quot; the MPEG code module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the packages of M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or W@@ AV of the Di@@ asch@@ au . &quot;
all images will be sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the chosen video format . additionally you can choose a background color for the box . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can eventually use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
&quot; you must first select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG di@@ h@@ au . afterwards , you can set up the module via ex@@ tras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . &quot;
the images selected by you are then listed under picture files in the portfolio . there you can also change sor@@ ting of the pictures or the contents of the list .
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , XV@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to re@@ configure the appropriate TV standard PAL , Sec@@ am or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre@@ set and highest probably the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should indicate time in seconds that displays a picture . the speed of the picture is defined below . a lower value is generated very sudden , a high on the very smooth image changes . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should let it be black . you can set the name and path of the created file using the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . keep using it as possible . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under name of the audio source file , then this will be integrated into the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can easily go to the production of your computer . depending on the speed of your computer you can get a coffee and enjoy the di@@ asch@@ au if you are back again . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ ers or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages on the button settings right below . &quot;
the printer assistant allows multiple pictures to print on a sheet of paper together in standard Photo@@ output . this is e.@@ g : useful to make you improve or use the Gimp module for direct expression .
&quot; using this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can convert your images stored in the RA@@ W format images in one of three formats JP@@ EG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM or convert . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command lines d@@ cra@@ b by Dave Coff@@ in . an original county of Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it generates the same results , as the software from your camera manufacturers . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! &quot;
first select the RA@@ W @-@ file the converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w image kon@@ verter window appears in the mode for a single image . with the button Pre@@ view you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
&quot; you can now re@@ vert the values to optimize the conver@@ sions process . the first option decides whether the camera settings can be used for the white @-@ table . the essential parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be j@@ us@@ cated . if the result is not optimal , you can later edit the picture later . &quot;
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G Con@@ version can be selected so that you can use the contra@@ sting information . if your camera is working in R@@ GB mode the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion line . the file name remains unchanged and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JP@@ EG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; tagged Image Format , TI@@ FF , maintains all the information of your image and uses los@@ s@@ free L@@ Z@@ W compres@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re going to edit your pictures frequently or later on , you should not choose the JP@@ EG format as it is only a limited number of operations , since the image quality is bad . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JP@@ EG as a storage format , the met@@ adata included in the RA@@ W file are stored in the JP@@ EG file in the EX@@ IF data . &quot;
&quot; once you have adjusted your settings , you can start using the button button . in case you want to cancel this process again , you can use it to break down . &quot;
&quot; the batch processing mode allows you to convert different images on one time . use this mode therefore , if you are safe , e.g. by testing in a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the settings available are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , this is helpful if it has been created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress beam shows how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to re @-@ comp@@ ress all pictures in an album . it uses the program from the ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following picture formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of an album , you can use the pre@@ fix , the starting and tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
&quot; this module can be used to modify the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it uses the original program from the ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can make the image smaller or enlarge . for this , four types of picture change are made available : &quot;
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in dimension . the width or height of the picture becomes automatically , depending on the image orientation , selected . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : sizes change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : dis@@ proportionate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; printing processing : prepares the image for the photo print . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the phot@@ op@@ iers . the target picture , inclusive back@@ size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images to your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the added images before . further images can be drawn to the list of the pictures and disc@@ ard it there .
&quot; after you have started the module , the pictures will be displayed with the pictures selected by you . you can add more pictures to the button below . for the last selected picture a preview is displayed on the right . &quot;
you can also drag images to the picture list and put it in order to add you to the list of appearing images .
with the button images you will remove the selected images from the list of hot pictures .
after you have selected all pictures you can open with the button OK the new message window of your e @-@ mail clients . you just need to add the addresses and subject . the images you selected are already attached .
note that not too many pictures to send at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of sending e @-@ mails . it may be possible to send a good idea to emails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and each time is used until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after the selection of comments in a attached file , the comments to the images are put together into a text file and the mail attached . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it &apos;s best adapted to loss of photo files such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG when you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend you to the JP@@ EG format . &quot;
&quot; when you select JP@@ EG under pictures file format , and the original files in the JP@@ EG format are , then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ data are added to the appearing images . &quot;
&quot; when the process is done , the window will not automatically shut down so you can view the status messages , looking for errors , but your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . with the button Connect , you can re@@ lie this window ? s . &quot;
after starting the module advanced Di@@ asch@@ au you will have a window with questions like you want your dip in the box . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
&quot; the Option OpenGL transi@@ tions in the presentation are enabled very elegant cap@@ tions via OpenGL . however , they must have an appropriate graphics card , because otherwise the di@@ asch@@ au will be very slow . &quot;
&quot; the fil@@ en@@ ame option shows that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the pictures displayed in the lower left corner , while the presentation will be displayed . &quot;
the loop loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a termin@@ ating loop . you can manually cancel it with Es@@ c ;
the option images accidentally choose that the pictures will be displayed in a random order . so it is not used to use the pictures in the album .
&quot; under delay between the pictures , the temporary distance between the individual images can be set . 1500 mill@@ ise@@ con@@ ds correspond 1,5 seconds and are a good standard . the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen effect effect . so you should test this before you show your friends ! &quot;
there are more than a dozen transi@@ tions between which you can choose . random@@ ly select a different effect during each transition between pictures .
&quot; during the dip tank , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left side of the screen . move your mouse into this corner to turn on you . &quot;
with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again to jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slides .
&quot; at the left side of the screen , you can view the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of pictures in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date j@@ us@@ ort currently has no documentation . in case you are interested in writing this , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants in this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set an image as a background image for the work@@ surface .
&quot; this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu as a background for your K@@ DE work@@ surface . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can see with &amp; on photo@@ sets ; see this brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see by a comparison with the image , are now available in each group , so in people , places and in group keywords entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window , you see the categories for which you entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look at EX@@ IF @-@ based informations , to view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course the current preview images . &quot;
&quot; if you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
if you select another person just select the pictures on which both persons are visible . through this selection method you can restrict the number of images shown in a few thousand pictures on a few single pictures .
&quot; if you selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view the thumb@@ nail pictures to see the pictures of your range . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of its name . you can save on &amp; photo@@ sets ; however , for every person a own thumb@@ nails , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself . see this picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the name , select the button , which you want to use to the right outside on the tool@@ bar . in the appearing context menu , you can select which view you can use for example symbols with images of persons and at the same time show a list of keywords ( if you do not have appropriate pictures for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you must also specify which image is to be displayed for each individual person . now , you will need to display the image dialog box displayed in the context menu . in the starter window , you can customize the picture factor according to your wishes and thus select which part of the image is to be cut or cut off . &quot;
&quot; if you call on the entry icon in the main window , you will see a dialog showing the dialog for placing the image properties very similar . this dialog can be viewed on the picture once more . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string in the box or description , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the pictures will be searched for . if you want , you can also enter a date , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the bottom of the window you can browse all pictures after a certain name , as you can see in the picture . here , according to pictures , on whom Jes@@ per , however , are not Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you do not like to read hand@@ books , but rather try out functionality , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
go to the homepage of &amp; on photo@@ sets ; and take a look at the quick entry to the screen@@ caps and the introduc@@ tory videos .
&quot; start &amp; on photo@@ sets ; and choose in the first dialogue the demo , if you start &amp; on photo@@ sets ; for the first time start , or choose in the menu Help menu item on photo@@ sets ; finally , some sample pictures will be loaded and you can test the functions of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; try out . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; on photo@@ sets ; as a related HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; on photo@@ sets ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this hike is shown here : . as the name suggests , this leads us file statistics about the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then shows another unit . you can change between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . in the picture you can see a part of a database by pointing the emp@@ t only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be inter@@ actively used in the following ways : you can preview the preview entries from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date in Pre@@ view points are displayed ) and also displays the tim@@ eline at the moment to navigate in Pre@@ view View . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a range of the tim@@ eline , by pressing the mouse button and drag the mouse over the lin@@ e@@ al of the tim@@ eline , so the tim@@ est@@ amps , drag . if you choose one area , you &apos;ll be able to select only pictures of this period . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a beams of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&amp; on photo@@ sets ; introduces you two ways to create HTML @-@ websites with your images . the one is available in &amp; on photo@@ sets ; integrated into the following part of the user manual ( see below ) . in the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; on photo@@ sets ; integrated version that you can access the HTML code using the menu .
&quot; before HTML @-@ pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into three areas content , layout and destination . in the following , each area is described more exactly . &quot;
&quot; first enter the title of the over@@ look and a description that is to contain the HTML file . on photo@@ sets ; HTML @-@ example pages , you can see an example of these settings . &quot;
next you choose whether a &amp; free photo album ; -@@ export file is created to be seen on the overview page . nour@@ ish information on export files can be found in .
&quot; finally , you can select which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages . by doing so , you can avoid that information is displayed on the viewer . for example , that all pictures are exported without the description . you can therefore use all the pictures at the moment . you cannot use this attitude to hide certain images from certain be@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in this area , you can define how the HTML pages are to look like . most settings are clearly , which is why they are not specifically formulated . &quot;
&quot; on the page you can adjust different resolutions on the pictures . by doing so , those who want to view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more images download those for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you have specified . so he can browse your pictures with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if it wants to get an image larger , he changes to higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setup area , set the different folders and URL where your site is stored . &quot;
best select for all your HTML files and for each subsequent set a new sub@@ folder .
&quot; first , you have to select the main folder in which all your pictures will be saved . this folder will be saved and select for all future pictures to the location . here you can choose either a folder or another by K@@ DE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; once you have created your pictures , you can check if these really are all visible for viewers . if you choose for the base folder a URL will be started . the URL you set here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you are not in the final target folder , you need to manually copy them manually . hence the import function , see , correctly you must specify the final destination of the files , but the first @-@ folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings that are currently described are all three on basic folders or URLs . in this one sub@@ folder , whose name you can set in output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re looking for a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; on photo@@ sets ; you might want to add a HTML page to viewing the pictures . however , if you have already applied a HTML page to viewing the pictures , then you have to do with &amp; on photo@@ sets ; this work doesn &apos;t even do that . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; on photo@@ sets ; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import it into your database , using ex@@ - and imported . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images are stored even in the file or if the file is only one link to the file . the obvious downside is however the file size . however , the obvious downside is the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu File Export ... or together with HTML @-@ pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file is searching for the images in a way . first , the pictures are not found in the folder of .@@ k@@ im file . the corresponding pictures will not be found , so the images of the URL you have created when creating the HTML files . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML @-@ export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , dialogue for exporting images is described , which you can export using the File Export menu . &quot;
the most important option of this dialogue is whether to act in internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
&quot; if you want to copy manual to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images into the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with the option Autom@@ atically in the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically copy for you . &quot;
&quot; .@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most pictures are already compressed with JP@@ EG and the XML file itself is very small , it is normally not willing to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to comp@@ ress this file , simply select the export file . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size . if you want to send your friends pictures , you might want to send the pictures to full size as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size by saying that each picture should be maximum of 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; when you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu File ... select , becomes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in . &quot;
&quot; the wizard for imports consists of four steps . first , you must select which images you want to import , afterwards , in which folder the import@@ ing images are to be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ alize the category persons of the desired file person@@ er ( if you are a sw@@ ans ) , while this category is called by your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog window , which categories of the imported file are to be imported and which categories they comply with your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can get the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . an example of this is shown on the picture . &quot;
&quot; it must be easy to browse and watch pictures : if you look at pictures , you often want to see pictures of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend on it , you may want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pic@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will watch the various steps from ( 1 ) fixed the information on your pictures , via ( 2 ) the play@@ through and prestige , through to ( 3 ) advanced themes and adap@@ tability . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ album was started as a program to administr@@ ate your pictures . however , it has also been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is spoken about pictures , but frequently these also closes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; photo album ; saves all its information in the file inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml to the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file , you can backup on a program of your choice , e.g. normal backup tools , to backup on a disk or revisions in CVS . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; remembers the folder in which your pictures are stored and uses this in future start @-@ album . if you want to start another folder with pictures , you can start a different folder tree ; using the option -@@ c . as example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; on the menu entry settings on photo@@ sets ; set ... you get to a window , with which you can change the settings of &amp; photo@@ sets ; in the following section of the user manual , the different settings are explained . &quot;
&quot; on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can view the preview options and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can access by a button pressure on the F1 button and a click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; it was described as you can specify for each picture of different properties , e.g. persons , places and tags . you can also create your own groups such as items , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; in view of the dialog , which is used to process already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a cap@@ tion and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in dialog options , you can set up complete membership groups , i.e. , for example , all the members of a group at once in a group , instead of explaining all groups of a member &apos;s as explained . &quot;
&quot; in view of the settings options available to you for placing the membership groups . with the above @-@ arranged selection list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window there is a list with the current categories and in the right list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&amp; on photo@@ sets ; shares his module with other graphics applications such as checking K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin interface . nutritional information can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
&quot; the modules can be called via the menu modules . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ sets ; however , most modules have a help page that you can call via the modules themselves . &quot;
&quot; because the modules of multiple applications are shared among each other together , it may be testing the modules with &amp; on photo@@ sets ; therefore , you should always test new modules with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; &gt; or via the menu Help . say not , I would not have warned ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules about K@@ IP@@ I together are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; on photo@@ sets ; not working . this is the downside if you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ photo@@ sets ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are not supported in albums : this kind of order is not supported , simul@@ ates it for some modules the order by albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; on photo@@ sets . &quot;
&quot; thereby simul@@ ates &amp; photo@@ sets ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all the pictures that shows you the picture show at the moment . &quot;
besides the current album you need to pass on a photo album ; the modules also have a list of albums . here goes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
&quot; if &amp; on photo@@ sets ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will be the category that you have specified in the entry dialog as category for virtual albums , so if you have , for example , use the category people , will do a photo@@ photo@@ album ; so if you have selected people to view it and pass this on to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; on photo@@ sets ; not compatible can you remove them from the list of modules . start the setting dialog , and choose modules to load the modules . &quot;
in the picture you can see an example of a starter screen as soon as you can start on photo@@ sets ; with your own pictures .
&quot; as you are accustomed to using any other K@@ DE application , you can see the window below using the tool@@ bar . at the moment , you will not see much information about your pictures in the tool@@ bar . at the moment , you will not see any information about your pictures . in the section we will show you at the following pictures , which will show you an overview of all available images . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ sets ; is the possibility to see every picture with notes . this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture , and you can put each image either individually or for a larger number of pictures given certain remarks at the same time . if for example on all pictures from Jes@@ per and all pictures in Copenhagen were included . &quot;
&quot; all these notes can be used for seeking and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want to see these notes , if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; you can see three lists using a text box by choosing people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; photo@@ sets ; as you will always use them when you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; following the following idea , reloc@@ ating the images within the list : if you are for example a family @-@ party and on all 50 frames the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are pic@@ tured , so you can move the names used upwards to find the individuals faster and arrange . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to have a list of alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sor@@ ting on the list below the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected any comments on each picture separately , you may need to edit all selected images and add these pictures with notes . in this case simply click on the buttons and back buttons , which are placed on the right corner of the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more comfortable to mark all these pictures and to use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . besides , San Francisco and Los Angeles lie in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is an over@@ group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the dialog box , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new Over@@ - or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also take an entry into a category and disc@@ ard it to sort this to a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this requires you to sort out your categories alphabe@@ tically . see this . &quot;
&quot; you can post@@ p@@ one the individual elements of the point of view by forming the void , which form the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make a separate window by moving him outside the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted the appearance of the window so adapted to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click the button Options which provides you with the possibility to save the current design and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also leave a frame completely . if you want to see this window appear later , use the button Options ... and here window will see a / out . this process can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; when you select the entry images in the browser , you will find an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or of all images in case you have no filter . an example can see the size of the thumb@@ nails , by simply drag the mouse button with the middle mouse button , configure . try it simple times . &quot;
&quot; if you drop an image on the background of your desktop , this picture is set up as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , this picture is displayed in the picture below . if you do not have a window opened with an image , a new ad window will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete pictures from you , simply select the appropriate pictures you want to delete or select the Edit menu . now , the window will display you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; &amp; on photo@@ sets ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; namely , you need to use the pictures anywhere without having to record on your hard disk . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard disk . &quot;
&quot; pictures , on which the right upper edge is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for example , the thumb@@ nail pictures exist , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , you can preview the preview images . however , you cannot view these pictures with the picture below . &quot;
&quot; as you see this function you need to copy files from the folders and then copy . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; therefore , it does not support you to avoid downloading any of the question . so if you want to avoid the mess of your pictures , please purchase a bigger hard disk in order to save all pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the menu images , you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to stay a little bit more privacy , you want to stay at the end those who may want to watch for others un@@ accessible and click &quot; &quot; Update View &quot; &quot; in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also select all the pictures that may see your little sister , che@@ ers and menu items All except current view . &quot;
&quot; with this , you have specified which pictures are to be hidden in the case of the case . if you want to block the laptop with your little sister , simply select the entry into your little sister , allowing all the pictures you want to get locked out . if you want to see the pictures again , click on lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password which needs to be entered into the pictures . to set up this password , simply select password change in the menu privacy . &quot;
&quot; remember that this picture protection is by no means very secure . for one , all the pictures on the hard disk and on the other , anyone who can access the inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml to read the password as un@@ encrypted text only , those with &amp; on photo@@ sets ; not very familiar to rep@@ el the view of private images . &quot;
&quot; the reason you can contem@@ plate all your pictures with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ sets ; of course you want to contem@@ plate them at some point . for this reason , &amp; on photo@@ sets ; for this reason you can view a picture _ and video clip . this is why you can preview how it is described . &quot;
&quot; you can see the viewer in . it shows of course the picture , but additional information you have to enter into the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ box is on the upper part of the picture you want to see it , you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed . all these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . you can find all these options below . &quot;
&quot; some words in the info box are underlined . if you click here the browser , see the matching entries to this show . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected all the pictures from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded several pictures in the viewer , you can switch between them and go back by using the keys image high and image . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also accessible from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run this as di@@ h@@ au . &amp; photo@@ photo@@ sets ; then loads a new picture after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image after a few seconds . how frequently it will push a new picture after you press the string key and plus or minus . started and hal@@ lowed by the keys C@@ tr@@ l ; S . &quot;
a very useful skill of the be@@ holder of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ sets ; it is used in full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to the full screen mode and back .
&quot; if you use the viewer , you can enter the image in the image and sli@@ pped across . with the minus key , you can drag on a rec@@ tan@@ gle The plus button zo@@ oming in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom @-@ rec@@ tan@@ gle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the picture does not be zo@@ omed . with the equ@@ als puts the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel corresponds to a pixel of the image . &quot;
&quot; note that the only zo@@ om@@ operations that work in videos will work , that in and out @-@ zoom with the Plus@@ - and Minu@@ ste are . &quot;
&quot; with the screen@@ functions from the context menu , you can rot@@ ate the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current image with the menu item note from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the pictures you can see a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to put on the picture . at the moment you can watch the view and configuration dialog of the picture to insert this name . however , you might just prefer to mark the picture and look at other pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the photos on paper . to see which photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark it as well or poorly , while one can watch one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer offers the possibility of providing images with features while watching them . features are the letters A to Z and you can visu@@ alize a characteristic that you press the appropriate letters . in view , you can see a picture where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have any features set on your pictures , these are available to you in your browser . so if you have all the pictures you can edit , print or whatever selected , so you can use one module to copy the selected images on a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
categories and special features can be shown in the thumb@@ nail view . if you want to display categories in your thumb@@ nail view then you can press features to the pictures simply by clicking the letters for the feature after the image was chosen . you can see it here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on an image . for this case allows you to paint on photo@@ sets ; on the picture to paint .
the painted won &apos;t be saved with the image but in the database . in the way you can und@@ o your painted later .
in one you can see a picture on the painted . to switch off the painting mode of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; click on the image below the context menu . to end the painting click on the cross in the tool@@ bar on top of the window .
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; you need to be able to control the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , but you should not have read and understand the documentation of Po@@ v@@ ray . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the properties tab , and the object is shown in the wire formats . &quot;
&quot; you can also select several objects simultaneously . but not the object of an already selected object , since all the objects already selected are selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu . &quot;
&quot; there are several possible positions , the following folding menu is built , so that you can choose the right position : &quot;
&quot; with del@@ eting either from the menu bar , or from the contex@@ tual menu of the right mouse button , you can previously remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed qualities , click to apply these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with a fault description . then you can click the input error and click on the changes with Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; when you enter the path to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , user documentation in the dialog box , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . reference to the shown object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview a preview in the Fe@@ atur@@ ity view . &quot;
&quot; view Pre@@ view in the peculi@@ arity view and a small example of the scene is reduced with the chosen texture . as default the entire texture is lo@@ oted , even if you want to ren@@ ame a sub@@ ordin@@ ated element ( for example , a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , you cross locally . &quot;
the scre@@ enshot shows the check@@ points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is chosen , the control points disappear and it will display a small cross in the wire model . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by pulling the mouse within the entire window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a fe@@ asi@@ bility level . you can specify this value relative to the visual level of the superior object , or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected or their visibility of view are smaller or equal in the tool@@ bar range . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window size as default . the object tree and view of the lens properties are left and the four graphical views are shown on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window order , or if you need a different arrangement , you can adjust it as you like . you can also save multiple walls and easily change between different orders . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or under a view , drag the starting water to the top or bottom of a view . a rec@@ tan@@ gle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the starting line to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange multiple opinions on each other , drag the Beg@@ inning in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the picture card . &quot;
&quot; the final possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to dis@@ solve a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the Beg@@ inn@@ y to the desktop or click the little to the left upper pointing arrow at the editor . &quot;
&quot; to view a view , click on the small cross in the tool@@ bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu View , you can find entries for any type of views . new views are web@@ based , you can anchor them to any location . &quot;
&quot; the current window view can save you with view window rules ... save . it will display a dialog , in which you can save the window @-@ order under an existing or new name . &quot;
&quot; if you created a scene , you can ren@@ ame it . &amp; po@@ v@@ ray ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to ren@@ ders , this program must be properly installed . this version is written in &amp; po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 is not supported . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ ame the current scene , click on the symbol ren@@ ders the symbol ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the menu View page . &quot;
&quot; a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the orders in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , s ini files . it determines the size and quality of the rendering system . if you want to insert a scene in various image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of install@@ able modes , from a fast preview to full pictures in highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the icon The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar or in the menu View modes ... , the following dialogue will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can type any name , but makes sense , but a name that lets the characteristics of the mode can be recognized . &quot;
&quot; in the diamond card size , you can enter the width and height of the framed picture . if you just want to ren@@ ame a small area of the image , select the tick @-@ section sub@@ section and enter the image detail into the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in the combination field quality , you can select the properties that uses &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for ren@@ ders . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflections . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the user manual for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . &quot;
&quot; if a picture is detected with only one beam the pixels , there can be different errors . these images often do not display a Mo@@ er@@ è patterns or du@@ p effects in curves and lines , in addition , details are not displayed when representation are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called Ali@@ ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally see pictures with this property better .
if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because each pixel is adap@@ tive and adap@@ tive because each pixel is repeat@@ ed@@ ingly divided again and adap@@ tive because each pixel will always be split up again and adap@@ tive because the re@@ curve depends on the calculated colour @-@ values . &quot;
&quot; when you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a beam the pixel . if the difference between the finishes to the neigh@@ b@@ oured pixels sur@@ passes the previous threshold . if you adjust the lowering value on 4 , a grid of 4x@@ 4 additional points is calculated , with a lowering value of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the pre@@ determined threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels that are individually pursued and can be checked on further sub@@ directories . the maximum depth of recur@@ sion can be set with the lowering . &quot;
&quot; a further possibility to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is to reduce the production of noise for the beam process , called i@@ it@@ tering . if you turn on J@@ it@@ tering , changed &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays are around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the last setting for quality of Ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can set whether the Alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the affiliated beams have no object made .
&quot; opens a new window for viewing the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason for this . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ Sc@@ ene , select the menu item &quot; &quot; Import &quot; &quot; ... and select a file in the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; not yet the complete command of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; if on imports of error messages or warnings , a dialogue window shows a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; import this code text between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
&quot; you can extract objects from the object tree in the editor to export the code text for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . this adds to the code text of the object in the editor . to import objects in the scene , simply highlight the code text in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
&quot; with copying and inser@@ ting in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , too . &quot;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is Po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ Po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; click on the object &apos;s help , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . user documentation for the shown object . put the path to your documents and version . support the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example al@@ timeter ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . library . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to those files here . if a file is used in different paths of the library , the first discovered file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the color of the rec@@ tan@@ gle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window @-@ type characteristic .
&quot; you can set the object beginning of the points on the R@@ aster in the context menu of the wire model . you can adjust here the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the shown objects , but require more time to rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can adjust the detail stage for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross the high details of details for advanced proj@@ ections , all the wire model points are further divided , if the camera is an extended projection . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to the perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . this property results in a better approach for proj@@ ections , but requires more time to rendering . &quot;
&quot; when you tap wall , a wall is lo@@ oted behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a box pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; when you tap soil , a ground is lo@@ oted beneath the objects . the ground is displayed in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; if you activate the edge certificate , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be set . more precise information about the parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender modes . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can modify existing window orders or create new window systems . in the section window systems explains how to create and store settings . &quot;
the set @-@ up standard window code : displays all existing windows orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program .
&quot; the list of existing window systems shows all existing window systems . a new order can be created with the button &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; and delete a selected order with the button . &quot;
every window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all the views on the chosen window rules . new views can be created with the button addition and delete selected views with the button removal .
&quot; the position of the new window . with new column , you will create a new column on the right side of the available windows , with un@@ condition@@ ers you will find the window under the available window , with the same view and web@@ brow@@ ing the view not in the main window , but creates a seper@@ ate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have just installed &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray and &amp; po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and now you would like to follow the two programs without more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but easy scene , under beginners very popular : a bul@@ let at one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should be aware of the following warnings , just before you complain that you can use as a result only a black screen . if you use a 3D program for first time , you should note these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to ren@@ ders , as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you want to insert no light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have everything error @-@ free installed , you will see the first launch of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the following window @-@ placed windows : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . read the documentation , so that you can get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols now often , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item editing . hence , you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
the wire model shows how the camera considers the whole scene that you can create . especially notice this in the fourth wire model ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click , you can see the content of the view Properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user &apos;s guide to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , you will find more details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in the view points can change with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; if you apply the button or press the input button , the wire model signals and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the point of view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could insert a Qu@@ ader ( Past@@ ing physique Qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a non@@ represent@@ ational method of solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; actually provides a easier way . you can use an infinite level as a floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in object tree , change the name and then press the button or the input bar . in the object tree the new name will immediately be displayed . &quot;
&quot; the wire @-@ model shows also the level , albeit at the moment only as a limited time level . when you ren@@ ame the scene , the level expands up to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the object tree carefully , you will notice that you click on the bottom + in front of the object . you then see the different options for each new object : scal@@ ding , rotation and shift . choose one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the properties tab . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the ground to exercise an entity under the sky@@ line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; just choose the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something for the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog will open in which you can select how the object is to be inserted . please select the name in the object tree ( name = floor @-@ pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button Pre@@ view see how the pig@@ ment now looks . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments displays only a flames material because you can input settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , remember that you can preview the appearance of materials anytime with a click on Pre@@ view . also , there are many options now , but take the easiest option now . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see any color on Qu@@ ader and ball in the preview , please click the button below and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now really set . if you ren@@ ame your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; of course , that &apos;s not the color list . you need to enter two new attributes , called mono@@ chrome list . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
choose in the object tree jed@@ es@@ mal and change the colors in the view of the properties tab :
&quot; this step should be easily exec@@ utable , as you should have understood the fundamental functioning of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the bul@@ let can be just as simple as the floor : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the properties tab , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for radius : on 1 ( don &apos;t forget the ball button or the button ) so that the ball would float above the ground as you have pushed the ground around a unit down . &quot;
&quot; of course , the rendering now returns a strange result : as before , the ball @-@ surface appears like a flames material . set in the following step a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign material to it . as before , enter the ball a pig@@ ment as colour : &quot;
&quot; select Sub@@ object and change the name for example in ball pig@@ ment . click on ball pig@@ ment , select then one @-@ color and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; however , you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish features : &quot;
then change the values as shown in the following scre@@ enshot and click on the button bar .
&quot; the settings gl@@ oss effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal@@ lic : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what kind of possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; hopefully , you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scen@@ eries . &quot;
Ray@@ tracing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ y@@ trac@@ ts , the rendering of hyp@@ othe@@ tical beams from the perspective of the be@@ holder ( i.e. from the camera that removes the scenes ) by each pixel in the scene and how this beam will affect the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects can affect pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will not see without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you see also nothing , the image is simply black . obviously each scene , which is to be lo@@ oted , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
&quot; opens a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; &quot;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaced the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and space . &quot;
the scene has been re@@ vit@@ alized in the last recorded version . all changes since the last storage is rejected .
you can only select this menu item if you have not saved changes in the scene .
&quot; repeatedly , the last revers@@ ed command . you can only select this menu item , if you have used Edit back@@ end . &quot;
saves the current window code and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new order or write an existing arrangement .
&quot; in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; here you can change the look , the keyboard short@@ cut and the default behavior . &quot;
open a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new commands to this option ; commands may change or add new ones .
&quot; opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove this option tool@@ bar for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; commands , and remove commands . &quot;
a B@@ ump @-@ map is a way to pre@@ face rough surfaces without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a B@@ ump @-@ Map as well as for a texture map .
&quot; basic body are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then further edited , in order to give them a realistic appearance . &quot;
&quot; a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel base , using a image file as a color card . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable screen watching and browser . the application has a file browser , where you can select images to the display . &quot;
pictures can be shown either in its own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very easy . the user browser lists files that you can use with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the button returns .
you can set whether any picture is to be displayed in a separate window or whether all pictures are always to use the same window .
&quot; if you &apos;re looking for a specific file , simply tap the first character of the file in your browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a pass@@ ender file is highlighted , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing return or &amp; Es@@ cape . &quot;
&quot; in dialogue setting - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five book@@ marks . in three of them , general and editing and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; cu@@ ck@@ show ; in the two others , short commands for display windows and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the respective windows can be set . &quot;
&quot; if this picture is selected , then the pictures are opened in full screen mode . if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the ad surface is filled with the background color that you can continue to set down . default is not a full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; if this point is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you look at the current image . this reduces the delay if you choose the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow . &quot;
this option saves &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; at the end the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the coloured beams to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode , the window is bigger than the image , also here the background with the selected color is filled . &quot;
&quot; you can set up &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , so that only some of the file types will display , which can also represent the program . &quot;
this option is extended for large images to display the display window on the full screen . this option is switched as default .

&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; checking came ; image processing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; checking ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a quick image processing with some powerful bas@@ tions tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is a show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes to its part , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; the menu features you as easy as possible errors or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu features a link with a link . if you use it , your browser opens a page for reports of problems and wishes . all required information is already filled , and you can simply follow the instructions to give your message . &quot;
&quot; the show@@ photo ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ foto and hopefully soon you can get questions to other users of &amp; show@@ photo ; however , in this mailing list will be English spoken , you should therefore be powerful this language . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list . guide to join the developer mailing list by &amp; show@@ photo . &quot;
&quot; the show@@ photo ; tries to give as much control over his work@@ flows as possible . there are many options to access the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo . to access these settings , you need to set up in eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the symbols of the left . &quot;
&quot; in the range of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the sub @-@ or over@@ exposure indicator has been selected . you should show the colors with what you want to display in contrast . under@@ exposure should show a bright color and over@@ exposure to a dark color . &quot;
&quot; the main window of the show@@ photo features a side bar on the right edge , which provides important information and actions to the selected images . the same page bar can also be found in image processing . you can view this in which you click on one of the five riders : &quot;
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that do not make more than scan@@ able images as images .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an easy application to scan images that do not make more than images to scan and record the images right away in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the pictures in front of the file .
you can check the status of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project by using the necessary information on this search site : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ in ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ p@@ l .
a standard scanner can be set at the command line from &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; by command sc@@ an@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; set in terminal . if this scanner is not specified or if no standard scanner is specified then a dialog to select the scanner is opened .
the user can choose to use the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . stop &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; finish .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; ( li@@ b@@ ks@@ ane ) these options are not particularly treated .
&quot; in order to add an image , the user can only start a pre @-@ cut@@ off and then start Scan@@ area for final scan . the preview can be launched by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to select the picture better , the user can jump into the image and go zo@@ oming from the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom also that the entire preview is fit in the window . &quot;
if the image was selected then the final picture can be read with the Scan @-@ button .
&quot; if before saving a preview display in the settings selected , then the image is displayed in a window display , like below is indicated , then the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? en leads to a break@@ out and you will get back into the main window . &quot;
&quot; with the button settings , the ep@@ onymous dialog will be opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the picture if desired , before saving . in this case the option for saving a preview must be selected . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected . &quot;
this option allows you to select the type as &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; pictures to save for each image opens the dialog to save each image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; this automatically with a generated name can be saved in a previously defined folder . then you must save money without having to ask for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
&quot; this option defines where the images are saved in the option to ask for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the pictures are saved after each scan , this folder will be used as a standard for dialog to save . the default value is your home directory , and you can change this with the button ... &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines a picture fix for the automatically to be mem@@ orized and in addition , the proposed name for the image in dialog for storing . the automatically saved image gets up@@ loaded a numer@@ ical addiction that each image is stored . the string chain # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality to store images . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the picture quality is not selected , then the standard value is used by Q@@ t . &quot;
the button help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; -@@ manual . the button Over starts the K@@ DE about -@@ dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; . the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to end &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite .

use the keyboard short@@ cut as all other programs . below you can set up a list of these cuts and their function . the Global keyboard short@@ cuts you can set up by clicking the player window by right mouse button and choose short commands .
&quot; you may set up available multimedia keys so set up , that they function as &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; this means you make your keyboard into the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ COP &apos;s interface from Amar@@ o@@ ok has many general functions that are usually also found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ COP &apos;s features of collection , context @-@ browser , players , play@@ lists , play@@ lists and scripts . an example call for the D@@ COP &apos;s function may break &amp; eg . &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ line options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition Amar@@ o@@ ok has some own command @-@ lines options .
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script should not be executed on account of a missing dependence . please check in your script if all the required modules are available and use box dialog , so that the user ID does not run . &quot;
Beg@@ in require &quot; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE Bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is not for this script . &quot; &quot; col@@ dialog --@@ sorry &quot; # { error } &quot;
in the folder scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as the base for your own scripts or simply extend it to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
&quot; with the help of D@@ COP can control your scripts data with Amar@@ o@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p , which should be included each K@@ DE installation . &quot;
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages allow the execution of external programs and commands . in this way , the function ex@@ ec is used ( ) . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy to be inv@@ oked . here an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all current scripts . for this reason , strings on the standard version of the script are written continuously . for this reason scripts should constantly monitor their standard checks and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events even if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure Weber is the script to view the furnishings dialog . to save the storing and loading of the furnishings , each script needs to take care of each script . if a script is started , Amar@@ o@@ ok the working folder onto the folder , where all data should be stored . &quot;
tr@@ ack@@ Change sign@@ aled that a new piece is played . the script could now look for more information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or the piece @-@ length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume sign@@ aled a change in volume . the new volume is an integer of 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ization Men@@ u@@ cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu item . revealing the path to the selected files of the playlist if a user @-@ defined menu item can be clicked on . to remove an entry back you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ tit@@ le ) .
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ended , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal S@@ IG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , e.g. saving data or configuration settings . &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that can be compressed to users &amp; eg . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) which can be tionally available with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) which can also detect the archive clearly as a Amar@@ o@@ z script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the remot@@ ely script . for this reason you should ren@@ ame your script packages correctly .
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar @-@ parameter -@@ p to get the file right : &quot;
&quot; when your script is ready , you can go up to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and link the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; app@@ ends . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; script . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is nevertheless surprisingly simple to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menu . maybe you are looking for a very specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collector browser and quick search searches , you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then , the playlist browser is still hard for you . and if the decision is still hard to select the dynamic mode , and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used , so you can choose to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to re@@ discover your music ! &quot;
&quot; usually you have to enter the first @-@ level folder of Amar@@ o@@ ok sources , to compile and install Amar@@ o@@ ok : &quot;
&quot; since &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ aton is used , you should compile no difficulties when compile no difficulties . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; , like most applications , has some options to enable or disable a comp@@ iling point with the configure script . this is a list of options available . &quot;
&quot; for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain depen@@ dencies must be fulfilled so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements . &quot;
&quot; activated de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you would like to help developing &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full use . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; can be set up without any trouble on the interior dialog . the furniture dialog has several caves to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ;
&quot; player windows view the player window , in addition to the playlist , or off . if the option is switched off , only the playlist window is displayed ( K@@ J@@ K ) . &quot;
&quot; m@@ bar@@ ometer use : this function is only available , if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the m@@ bar@@ ometer . &quot;
atmospheric exposure : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this will change the color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer .
&quot; m@@ oods files put in the music files : this function is only available , if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; saved with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . otherwise , the .@@ dat files stored in the settings @-@ file of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; saved ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / share / share / person@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
external browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started when a browser is needed .
&quot; other browsers are using : here , you can specify the path to another browser which is not located in the list . &quot;
&quot; playlist that you save , save the current playlist automatically with the end of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; enable this option if you do not want to lose the running playlist upon prayer . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you activate this attitude , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
current pieces of the piece change visible that the play@@ lists window - / rolls to hold the current piece always in the visible window area .
&quot; when applied to the context @-@ browser changes , the context @-@ browser automatically displays the context @-@ browser when the next piece is played . &quot;
in the section looks you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the section is divided into three parts .
&quot; in the font section you can set the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . you can use scripts for the following range : playlist windows , player windows and context @-@ browsers . tap on excerpts ... , so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of custom color scheme , you yourself have the spo@@ ilt for choice and can set a own color scheme . use this among them the activated color@@ chan@@ gers for front and background color . &quot;
&quot; playing back at the start , that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; after the program start playing back automatically with the play at the spot , with whom they stopped at the end of the end . &quot;
&quot; the sub @-@ screen Display module allows you to switch the OS@@ D . if on @-@ screen display , a preview of the OS@@ D is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
&quot; the first option is the font . click on excerpts ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OS@@ D . the tick @-@ field shadows causes that the text is shown in the OS@@ D . &quot;
&quot; your own colors will give you the possibility to adjust the OS@@ D colors for writing and background . one click on the color @-@ areas opens the dialog to color selection . if personal colors do not use , the presented &amp; k@@ de colors are used . &quot;
&quot; the text box display text presents the text shown in the OS@@ D . by entering space , the OS@@ D can be adjusted to your needs . below you will find a list of available Plac@@ eholder and what they mean . &quot;
the option screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify to which screen a multi @-@ target monitor environment the OS@@ D will appear .
the Car@@ tei@@ card audio @-@ output lets you select an audio driver from the selection range . some drivers activate some additional settings in this piece of the cart .
the collection of the collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , select &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to search for music files . to include a folder in the collection with its name . this section also includes an@@ alogue fields to setup , as should with the selected folders . &quot;
sub@@ folders search : this causes &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; both the well @-@ crossed as well as their sub@@ folder after music is going to search .
&quot; monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. if music files added or deleted ) . furthermore , a incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
&quot; play@@ lists import : causes , that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists included in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ ot@@ and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists may then appear later in the play@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; the part of the database database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , another device is needed in the sub @-@ window My@@ S@@ q@@ l establishment . &quot;
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l unit is used for setting the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used under calcul@@ ator : if the computer is entered , on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is entered under which the database is available . name : is the database name , which is the connection . &quot;
use user name : and password : to enter the data needed for connection to the database .
&quot; the car@@ tei@@ card relief .@@ f@@ m is the support for relief .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; can send the names of played pieces to a load .@@ f@@ m server , and create music recommendations for the current piece . &quot;
&quot; here , enter your username and password for your load .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register any page on the load . &quot;
&quot; packages , send and update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your load . f@@ m profile . &quot;
similar interpre@@ ters retrieve : according to activation of this setting will retrieve &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters to the played piece . you can see the list in the context @-@ browser . note : you do not need a load .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix @-@ systems ( such as &amp; example ; Linux ) . for more information see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen photos .
Amar@@ o@@ ok only requires the package of K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to install K@@ delicate ( including the programs included ) because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; require some of them to be compiled for example modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide such as to compile K@@ delicate minimal .
&quot; some functions such as the OS@@ D pres@@ upp@@ oses that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ ES@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will therefore work , but flu@@ x@@ box will support for example difficulties . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use K@@ delicate and Q@@ t because these represent an excellent development environment . &quot;
probably you can see one of your files a bug in the Tag@@ b library . you can re@@ see the file by logging in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ scan@@ .@@ log . afterwards you can delete the file cras@@ hed file . afterwards you can delete the file and create the collection again .
&quot; mostly it is that Tag@@ us cras@@ hes in reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . the support for it in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is a little more mature . &quot;
&quot; ensure that all libraries were compiled by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , tag@@ li@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x are compiled , then this leads to crash at the editing of the met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then disable automatic . switch off if in@@ active for ... in the setting of the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens at a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace the error will be guaranteed .
&quot; this is because many of the program records data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a information , but not flag@@ ged as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; &quot; $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b@@ - &gt; Help _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; &quot; errors in writing the tags from $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; &quot; $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed using this command : Perl -@@ M@@ C@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode ) / repetition / dynam@@ ical playlist ) see in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . in some cases , you &apos;ll see the status De@@ activated on grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol until this attitude shows their effect . &quot;
&quot; if you get this mistake : amar@@ cc@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ cc@@ app : im@@ pe@@ er symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ m@@ ap@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pixel map , then check if Amar@@ ok is the correct Q@@ t library . this can be found with ld@@ d &apos;@@ The amar@@ ok@@ app &apos;@@ _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t . &quot;
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ o@@ ok will find the right version first . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most installation problems clarify the easiest by using a experts to look for your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
&quot; Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to seek help , please enter there only one error if something is located at the recti@@ fying of a bug in Amar@@ o@@ itself . &quot;
&quot; after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok , only a blank playlist appears . how do you get there ? &quot;
this is easy . use the file browser to the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start @-@ window was converted into the statistics window . you can find it under ex@@ tras statistics . &quot;
the importance of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ o@@ 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
&quot; to evaluate pieces , must be displayed in the playlist the rating column . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column display . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ o@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press Ent@@ f on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select from the playlist from the folding menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a playlist file to the playlist and drop it there , just like you would like it with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , directly next to the add @-@ button , one can store the button playlist . click on it . &quot;
probably missing the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . look also to li@@ b@@ ate this package contains a lot of very nice visu@@ alizations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is in the context menu ( on the right mouse button ) . you will also find it on the menu bar under ex@@ tras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; no . yes , that is true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used one of the back@@ end independent approach , hence the real question must be supported G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we can support even text and p@@ NG . &quot;
&quot; it may ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 Dec@@ oder will be delivered ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : old @-@ F@@ 2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , En@@ ter &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ ather driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device has to use a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time , and can be achieved with the mix @-@ mix module for al@@ sa . ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa . &quot;
&quot; the issue of this command should help you find the problem and help you find a solution . for G@@ elling , you may need to give another S@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ hafts ) . &quot;
&quot; doing &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . do not forget that media must first de@@ co@@ ded first , you would just listen to a white smoke . G@@ ather is not reading the file , de@@ co@@ ded it and sends the PC@@ M data to Al@@ sa . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS de@@ co@@ fies the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can print directly to Al@@ sa , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use either the G@@ rout@@ ing drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open the control center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound server with a maximum priority ( real time ) and increase the size of the sound bu@@ ffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper SU@@ ID is set : &quot;
&quot; at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed play . read this error report . the magni@@ fying the sound Pu@@ ff@@ ers in your al@@ sa furnishing file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well . &quot;
&quot; either do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ multimedia complete around the fastest Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ m@@ pe@@ gli@@ .@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was strongly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts Pu@@ ffer in the Control Centre and Sound &amp; Multimedia , Sound System . the smaller the bu@@ ffer , the less jobs react to visu@@ alizations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ather is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , cras@@ hes &amp; Amar@@ ok . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . run G@@ ST register to register all the g@@ us@@ amer components . &quot;
&quot; read the FAQ FAQ . if that does not help , you can also ask for the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - shop you down , compile and install it . then run G@@ ST register again , once as system manager and once as your normal user . then delete the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ bel@@ amer config and run G@@ ST register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok . &quot;

&quot; if you want to search for entries , contain the spaces , then re@@ connect the key@@ word with ge@@ ek : Mike old@@ field . this makes it sought after entries to include Mike old@@ field , but not to orders such as Mike J. Classic . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a certain search column , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : &gt; 50 . this searches for mosquit@@ oes , which have a higher rating as 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to look for a piece that does not contain a certain phrase , make a minus sign before the phrase : - something looks for pieces , which do not contain something . &quot;
you can combine these par@@ sing variants for exposure to one another . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bath . this searches for all pieces that have either Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating as 50 and do not contain the commentary box .

c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital audio ) . in the Internet such programs are generally referred to as ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is an entirely open , patented and professional technology for audio data stream . O@@ GG Vor@@ um benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ g@@ g Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder@@ - and Encoder modules . &quot;
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio Dec@@ oder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers layers Lay@@ er I , Lay@@ er II , and Layout III ( eg . MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module . &quot;
l@@ ame : a widely developed MP3 decoder which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 @-@ Encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for loss of free audio compression and compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio @-@ Encoder module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
&quot; Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Muse@@ pack Dec@@ oder : further libraries for processing various audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg , it is possible to de@@ code WMA files to en@@ code them on an audio CD . &quot;
so@@ x : a b@@ ail@@ out program that can be used between different audio formats and convert . so@@ x is used by the so@@ x Audio Encoder module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ CD@@ Ima@@ ger : one of the function@@ all@@ uring author system to edit , dis@@ assemb@@ ling and analy@@ sing video @-@ CDs and super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can be useful for example , for creating a mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections , without norm@@ alize the different recording level of the different albums to the unpleasant effect that the music pieces can be re@@ printed differently . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically return all videos in the basic folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method recently opened up projects once again . the lower sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
&quot; saves the current project . once the project has been stored , the file will be over@@ written , otherwise it is asked for a new file name . &quot;
saves the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialogue Save beneath is displayed when you choose a folder and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you are saving for each individual project file saved .
&quot; closing the current project . if a project has changed and has not been stored , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after what should happen . you can then break down between saving and alter@@ ations . furthermore , you can also break down and keep the project opened . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for each not stored project , what should happen , just as if you were called Close for each project file . &quot;
&quot; includes all closed projects and finished &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; however , for each stored project , it is asked what should happen , as if you have called sh@@ utt@@ led file . &quot;
&quot; when you call this entry , you can select from the appearing dialog files to add the project . this has the same effect as if you move the files directly from the upper view into the project view , the added files appear in the basic folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog &quot; burning &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the characteristics of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; the burning dialog can only open when the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; opens the characteristics dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What is that ? ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
&quot; this entry is only available with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes a previous session to import into the current project . this is useful when you &apos;re not using files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is useful for you to be used for you , so that you can see the files already existing in the medium already existing files and folders . &quot;
&quot; this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature set up &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . this function does not remove any files from the medium , it bl@@ ends only the files imported files again . &quot;
&quot; opens the CD @-@ Copy dialog . this also allows without project file , copying a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also only create a picture of a CD which you then want to burn later . besides , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal cop@@ ier . you should prefer cl@@ ones if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; opens the DVD copy dialog . this also allows without project file to create a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also only create a picture of a DVD with the help of the copying process is not yet supported , therefore the target medium must be big enough to accommodate the whole ( video ) data of the source medi@@ ums in the original form . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . with this , you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW . &quot;
opens the dialog to form a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) which makes the content completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing mod@@ i over@@ write and incre@@ mental .
&quot; the dialog is burning a CD @-@ image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ barbecue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which can then instantly supported by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , for this you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burning a previously @-@ called DVD @-@ image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a source of data , which can then be burned down by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; a previously illuminated DVD video can be converted . thereby , this dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used everywhere . it contains information about the illuminated video , code settings , and even possibilities to change the size and cutting black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the included medium . this information is presented in the table view and contain properties of the medium , such as size and title length of CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; displays a list of tool@@ sets of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; when this is crossed , a small bar at the bottom of the window is displayed . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not covered , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; switches the folder view , or out . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the content is enabled , its content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information , locking and dis@@ locking the disk or throwing the medium . &quot;
&quot; switches the content view , or out . the content view enables the selection and drag files into the projection view . the content view is also the interface to reading audio or video CDs , if a drive selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the copying list in the projection screen is a narro@@ wer area , which is only visible when the projection list contains no real function , it only looks pretty , and separates the projection clear from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialogue window to change the ke@@ ep@@ stakes for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after one has chosen one of the commands given in the upper part , you can adjust the key@@ code to it below . &quot;
&quot; this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; furnishings assistants . this allows the proper per@@ missions to burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administration rights should be required , therefore , you must enter the password for the system administration ( root ) at the start of the wizard . &quot;
&quot; opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here , general programs can be made . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and protect the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled through a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; to use scripts , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the something more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functionality , so more your taste and the type of your task is crucial . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter we assume that you use the command @-@ line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP in to use , you must first make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following at the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program have in common , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; primarily two more pieces that are described below . &quot;
&quot; the Standard D@@ COP H Interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions like copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions for generating new projects . &quot;
D@@ COP@@ re@@ cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ f cre@@ ate@@ bl@@ ed@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ re@@ cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ re@@ cre@@ e@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) D@@ COP@@ re@@ as@@ e@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) Vo@@ id Gen@@ o@@ e@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) Vo@@ id R@@ d ( ) Vo@@ id S@@ v@@ d ( ) Vo@@ id Bur@@ n@@ C@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) Vo@@ id Bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method one receives a D@@ COP in reference to the newly created project : D@@ COP@@ f ( K@@ 3@@ b ) : # K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by using # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project D@@ urch Use this reference is to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
&quot; K@@ 3@@ b offers the above @-@ listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface as well as the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which is only applicable on data @-@ projects ( CD and DVD ) : &quot;
&quot; Vo@@ id cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) Vo@@ id cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string parameter , Q@@ string Par@@ ent ) Vo@@ id remo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path ) Vo@@ id An@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path ) Vo@@ id ( Q@@ string path ) Vo@@ id set ( Q@@ string path ) Vo@@ id set ( Q@@ string ) . &quot;
&quot; for example , it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folder and then adds files to the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT OF DIS@@ T@@ fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT OF DIS@@ fi@@ le@@ .txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; the audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ reader for &amp; k@@ de ; with him can easily be recorded audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible depending on the Encoder which is installed on the machine .
&amp; the audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading from &amp; CD ; data in W@@ AV files on the hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders that code these W@@ AV files ( compressed @-@ free compression ) default ( these enco@@ ding packages still need to be added from the Linux distribution ) . additional enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
&quot; first , the titles of the &amp; CD will be read and stored in W@@ AV files on the computer ( los@@ sy and compressed ) ; and then &quot;
in a second step these W@@ AV files ( usually one per title ) is compressed to the MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG format or other formats such as los@@ s@@ free FLA@@ C .
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; used by &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ pres@@ so ( for MP3 ) must be installed ( for MP3 ) or other co@@ den@@ ers . all these programs are usually not necessary for any lin@@ ux distribution . however , only the codes needed to install it . if for example FLA@@ C is not used , the installation is also not required . &quot;
&quot; which code format is meant to be used ? the section Wel@@ ding Ko@@ di@@ ers gives a small introduction on co@@ ding , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD . if not the firmware of the CD @-@ device does not want to read it . in any case , &amp; Re@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; even do not avoid the mechanisms of copying protection ; simply avoid the purchase of copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while setting up only once has to be done ( the interior dialog can be called up to a suitable configuration ) , after daily handling of a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) to an understanding of the slim approach of user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble in the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which code programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can collect &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB from the Internet or can work completely without a network , whereby everything is manually recorded . &quot;
&quot; this is only a brief list of the commands of the main window . on the side step by step , you find further information on how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; starting the CD@@ DB inquiry of the CD data pursuant to the establishment of a request at the CD@@ DB . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case the connection to the internet should first be made . ) &quot;
start the read and - if a Encoder has been configured in the tab tool@@ kit - the enco@@ ding .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders so that selecting with a different Encoder can be read as the default . it is to note that previously the Encoder has been configured in the tab tool@@ kit settings .
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already illuminated file will be selected for enco@@ ding instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and code . &quot;
opens the interior dialog to configure the type of aler@@ ts ( like protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for application events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot;
opens the main entrance dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different car@@ properties ( like Encoder to turn the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
&quot; this chapter describes clay , codes and compression rates and helps you to choose the right body . &quot;
&quot; if no audio @-@ information is to be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also others like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may possibly be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are low compression rates and hardly any available commercial devices that can reproduce these files . &quot;
&quot; under the audio formats , the information through data compressed depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model are MP3 and O@@ GG the most common . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences are less important as both ex@@ di@@ ers are very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; o &apos;@@ not so &apos; freely , l@@ ame is still supplied with most distri@@ butions free , but there are open license issues &quot;
&quot; + high to very high sound quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG easily deeper quality at low bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from one machine or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playback equipment is available .
&quot; MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto stereo systems . today - initially in 2009 - these devices mostly support the MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and consequ@@ ent compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Medium &apos; = This setting results good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide maximum transparency for most people and most of the music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps CB@@ R , compression rate about 5.5 . needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good Gen@@ u@@ g for music of young people , portable devices and car stere@@ otypes . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps CB@@ R . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you definitely want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information that entered manually or fet@@ ched from the free@@ DB over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / used with &amp; audio creator ; and the code program to create the folder and file name , as well as the characteristics of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with codi@@ fication , there is often a combination of programs for the code and these parameters here . the manual or assistance to the codes explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to the key@@ word ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are co@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switches must be added from l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; -@@ tt } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button lab@@ eling in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which people can download the audio CDs , so that all others can download this information instead of text : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legally , but I ( min. of the owner ) is not lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; there is no more or less valuable , so neither the artist nor the music enterprise can be added any more or less valuable , so can neither the artist nor the music enterprise . all information can be obtained through a bum@@ ble@@ bee by a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; actively you can choose a tick @-@ box ( sending an address ) . for the use of free@@ DB it may be used with a different ( counterf@@ eit ) address used in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears that the e @-@ mail address is not used by the server ( This may only know the programmer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; in many countries , there are copies of the main database . if &amp; the audi@@ o@@ creator ; used to use free@@ DB , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally can be used on the next lying mirror server . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a list of reflections on the online call of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded ( usually monthly ) just the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in W@@ AV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more accurately , search in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see to note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the appropriate distribution must first be installed when this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to save the illuminated W@@ AV files , the enco@@ ders and thus the desired file format can be chosen . for the first opening there are pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss of loss for audio data ) on the tab . other codes can be added on this tab . &quot;
&quot; the enco@@ ding package must be installed by the internal Linux distribution before the code is used , and this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined co@@ den@@ ers . further information on co@@ den@@ ers are in the section Wel@@ ding Ko@@ di@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; after installing a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a single window ( eg , console ) . you must be replaced by the name of the installed code . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check out the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the writing and reading of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give an indication of what is wrong . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the sleeve of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is one chapter with one step for example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have read the complete manual , everything understood , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and our first &amp; CD ; read M@@ ame &apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; use MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps for average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 key@@ word ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; you need to be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame installed on your machine . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . in any case , it is not necessary to compile the source files as you can of course . &quot;
&quot; please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is made , and that you write requests for it ( eg by trying with the con@@ quer@@ or to copy something inside ) . &quot;
&quot; the first section covers the basic influ@@ encing of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; something that is probably done only once , and &quot;
the second section describes the procedure to read one &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each and CD .
here we determine the used Ko@@ di@@ ers to compression the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 up to 256 k@@ bps ) . when we are lazy in order to use the free@@ DB program to download the free@@ DB data from the Internet .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not change it at any read of a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name will pass to the reading program to read it the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can be read .
&quot; frequently , / dev / CD@@ ROM is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing sub@@ commands for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
the diamond card General settings . here you can &apos;t do much . here an additional conversion will be defined . in our example everything will be loaded / inserted as shown in the scre@@ enshot .
&quot; only if you can ask for the full information , so that you will be informed when information is missing from key@@ word ( tags ) . &quot;
the diamond card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and allow the &amp; CD to automatically download the Internet from a free@@ DB machine .
note : the machine needs to be connected to the Internet during reading the &amp; CD ; so that it can access the free@@ DB server .
&quot; the second selection field is easier , is a &amp; CD ; entry found immediately starts the read of the &amp; CD ; this is connected with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ame or tag entries , they can easily change . the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed using con@@ quer@@ or@@ - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; aside from this example , continue to note : if you want to enter everything manually , so disable the selection fields and free@@ DB is not used . however , this over 6@@ 20 MB large , consider this twice whether this is worth it . to free@@ DB in offline mode , the two choices must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following car@@ vings . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is free@@ DB for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server via the Internet . how does the system know what data the CD will get ? read the section on free@@ DB . put everything on how it pic@@ tured in the scre@@ enshot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server in your vicinity . on this way , the load between the machines is distributed . however , this setting will work as a first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both function equivalent to the server as though many fire@@ walls boot the protocol at 8@@ 80 default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf the internet . &quot;
in this example we do not want to transmit any &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server . the first check @-@ up should be cut off .
simply take the settings from the scre@@ enshot . ( make sure the folder / t@@ mp exists on your computer )
&quot; number simultaneously entertaining pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one simultaneously with just an existing drive ? parallel reading and enco@@ ding ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , so simply try myself . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , please tick this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you are logged in this folder , then the path / folder can be specified in which the W@@ AV files are present . if the file is not listed , the files in the private folder are not touching . if you don &apos;t want to make this folder , if you want something to do something with the W@@ AV files . &quot;
&quot; everything can enter as it is on the scre@@ enshot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be left to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo . the resulting com@@ pres@@ sible factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction on the production of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1.@@ 1.@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; ID@@ 3 &apos; day for &amp; k@@ de ; in the event of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the scre@@ enshot . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; number of simultaneously capable of enco@@ ding W@@ AV files : with a dual core or even a multi @-@ processor machine , you can code more than one W@@ AV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s it , we have just finished the basic device of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; in this section is described , as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; the folder structure is structured on the hard disk . first , a connection to the Internet is structured , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB will be described . the process that is described in this section needs to be repeated for any out &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; as we use one &amp; CD which is not yet available in free@@ DB , the screen saver will not see a little different from the data submitted for one &amp; CD ; with successful use of free@@ DB data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD manually instead of getting data from the Internet . comments will point out to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not yet to happen , the &amp; CD now has to be defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment the pieces and length should be listed in the window , as in the scre@@ enshot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; can be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
if this is not done then look for questions and answers concerning the help or go back to the previous section concerning basic settings .
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD has been done successfully by the free@@ DB , all tracks of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and album are shown . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; there is a window appears , and you can choose the database entry that will your opinion best to your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have the touch area selected for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for settings ) , you can also manually trigger this through choice of the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have local databases , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 : the CD @-@ editor - input of CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first row of the input field &apos; Update &apos; to the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist does not have to be entered in the input field &apos; Update &apos; unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece .
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for individual comments ini@@ di@@ aly@@ ell per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after successful withdrawal of data from the free@@ DB , the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains a good idea to check the content of the CD editor ( e.g. if all words with upper@@ case letters begin or not ... ) , but also to verify whether there are any unwanted remarks . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limited the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece , and on only 28 signs for the comment area . if you have ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have an unlimited field @-@ length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; max . this option is set on the tab &apos; tab &apos; tab . &quot;
&quot; you can change the day @-@ information of the generated files later at any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also re@@ generate ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all cook@@ ers or file formats . see the help of the enco@@ ding to get more information .
&quot; simply select an entry which is obvious with the style of the selected CD . in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information on the categories . pop or rap for example are to be found under skir@@ t . &quot;
&quot; after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , go back to the main window . simply click the line with the second piece . &quot;
&quot; the window of the CD editor will be back and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece on any case and other information you wish . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you entered all the front data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be shown above the piece list .
&quot; note that there is a check @-@ sign in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line is folded up the selection of the piece . make sure all pieces are selected , or pressing the button all pieces on the lower edge of the screen to select all pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; was started by clicking on the button selecting the read @-@ reading process , so this window appears to confirmation . click OK and then we &apos;ll take a look at the window with the orders and follow what &apos;s going on . &quot;
&quot; click on the rider orders to switch on the contract window . it is located in the top left half of the window , right under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is currently read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left bottom of the window in the status bar .
this error message see if you &apos;re trying to work with a Ko@@ di@@ erer which you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been co@@ ded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the t@@ mp file and the target sub@@ folders are not what we have entered here for example . have you checked if you have writing to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
&quot; order 1 reads the first piece out , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the co@@ ding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read and enco@@ ding parallel . note the status message in the bottom of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has found no configuration setting to op@@ press this behavior . the only thing is configur@@ able , is the number of parallel processes for reading and code . with powerful machines the result is unclear . the used machine with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and code ( of course two different pieces ) . &quot;
now the last title is read out while another piece is co@@ ded and a third order is co@@ ded in the queue . after the last piece is co@@ ded , a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window appears . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the code of your choice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Re@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; used today within the &amp; k@@ de ; CVS as part of the k@@ dem@@ ul@@ ti@@ media package . however , if you get acquainted with CVS , you can get an anonymous copy here . most distri@@ butions are already included in pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de package . if you read this , you probably have done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is aimed at individuals who compile data files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help such as the program can be adjusted to your needs , if it happens once , then the following is right for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs , many variations of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it features screen@@ caps of the different mapping cards of settings and also contains comments for options that may not be used in the example . &quot;
&quot; hello , still reading this ? even if only the help menu is clicked first after the first time start of the program , without any clue as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ; in drive is on the drive , or from the unusually short menu ? &quot;
&quot; what is it about ? who reads this , probably has started the program already . it should somehow look like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; but who wants to do something useful or change it may . at least just after contacting the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agreed with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange if you have succeeded in getting the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ... &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kara@@ oke of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others he has with real @-@ time and kar@@ a@@ oke liz@@ ards of texts also some features that others &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI player did not have .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the OS@@ S system , so it should work on all systems with OS@@ S and &amp; k@@ de ; supports also the &amp; Linux ; ultr@@ am@@ ound proj@@ ector , which is needed for CIS cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a Sequ@@ en@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid , displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI @-@ channel through the high@@ lighting of the pressing keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so you can move in &amp; k@@ de ; each MIDI file from a &amp; par@@ quer@@ or ; window on K@@ Mid can be drawn .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( delivery events or text events ) . K@@ mid determines automatically the procedure used .
&quot; seat support . if you finish &amp; k@@ de ; finishing in the game of a song , K@@ Mid starts again with the same song again . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI @-@ synthes@@ iz@@ ers , awe , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can choose opening ... from the menu File . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you choose the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; par@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will also work with multiple songs simultaneously .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it , and execute the button bar in the tool@@ bar , select the listing inser@@ ts from the menu piece or pressing the space bar . &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts when you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window ( in several pieces they are added to a collection and then play each other . )
&quot; once &amp; col@@ mid ; one piece happens , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the regul@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the temp@@ o . to get back the original speed , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry into rest in the menu piece , so breaks the play . pressing the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the reproduction . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te can be stored on two species in a music piece . some pieces use text files , others use ly@@ ed@@ tex@@ ter@@ pen@@ nis and others both . some pieces have no text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set what events are to be presented and even better : the E@@ ign@@ ist@@ type is automatically determined to enable a song so you do not need to set it manually . however , if you choose the option Autom@@ atic text @-@ selection automatically , the kar@@ a@@ oke text is selected . however , you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other type . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set a D@@ ign@@ ist@@ type fixed , select from the menu settings the entries of the items and shipment . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you summar@@ ise . these are played in the row . in this section , how you can use the collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to insert a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find this in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... click here on New and give the name to the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection is included in the beginning the same songs as the original one .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the measurements in the collection manager . &quot;
in the temporary collection you get all songs that you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . concern yourself if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song with the button Add a song , with whose help you can select the desired song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the setting of automation addition to the collection .
&quot; when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece by opening ( using file open or drag &amp; drop ) is automatically added to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; when Autom@@ atic add to the collection is not activated , when opening a piece , the temporary collection is activated and used . this collection will then be added to the opening songs . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song , and then click on removing . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence according to the menu item , the songs are played in the order , as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add songs or select a random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , choose it in the collection manager , or use the cut@@ out above the kar@@ a@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song , select the next song &apos;s next song , the entry next song from the menu item or push the button arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to reverse a song around the reverse , select the button previous piece , the entry previous piece of the menu item or push the button arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection manager and click the button del@@ eting . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter as they are not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers who are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events in events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map which conver@@ ts all the events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et , and thus always to play a trumpet as originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map , because all sound cards are GM @-@ compatible ( incl. gri@@ m and CIS cards , FM @-@ devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps , so you need to edit the appropriate file from hand ( using your favorite editor ) . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI @-@ map is a text file , which stores all the required re@@ alizations for the play of a piece . &quot;
&quot; every section can only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . however , it is possible that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
&quot; you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a section is reached . &quot;
&quot; please send me your map file as email , so I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer for devices that are not general MIDI @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible . &quot;
&quot; in this section , the patches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard are shown . the general usage is as follows : &quot;
&quot; note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that GM patches in the right sequence exist ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and neither line for one of 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to place all notes that need this instrument to put on the tone with the number M . if your key@@ board is not supported by a gun ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. using sound 60 ) , which is similar to a gun . to do so , enter the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; so if now a MIDI file should play a note with Patch 127 ( def@@ enses one ) , it takes place 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant that each tone represents another face instrument ( drums , pel@@ vis , mar@@ acas &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the tone represents the tone @-@ height of the ever same drum ( as some are some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is needed to indicate how sounds are shown on a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the order of the lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you must create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and any instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ boards are used mainly to tone sounds on the per@@ k@@ lift channel . take a look as the included Key@@ boards .
&quot; this section can be used to make some channels to others . if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel , you can simply do it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the perc@@ ussion to a certain channel ( General MIDI to channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI @-@ Devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following patterns : &quot;
&quot; n it is the channel that is pic@@ tured on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map is needed to use the name for this channel . in this case , all events are ignored to change the patch on this channel . in this case patch is used x x . &quot;
the option For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful for example to always use the per@@ k patch on the per@@ k@@ lift channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ ben@@ der@@ rati@@ o indicates in which proportion of Pit@@ ch @-@ ben@@ der events are multiplied . if a MIDI @-@ file sends a Pit@@ ch @-@ ben@@ der event , then this with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) is calculated and then transmitted . the value 40@@ 96 is used , so that in the map file is not a dec@@ imal ( total ) . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM gives you a keyboard , which should play a pitch @-@ ben@@ ding event with the value 40@@ 96 , a tone higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards tend to play two notes up to an oc@@ tave higher . to try to try a bit &apos; t@@ mid on your keyboard . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , just open the dialog MIDI settings . this can be found in the menu under Settings , point MIDI settings &quot;
&quot; the channel view is a window with a whole range of pi@@ anos ( one for every MIDI @-@ channel ) . on these cl@@ avi@@ aries , you see which sounds are currently played . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument . if you have changed a tool , the button is not more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to view the played notes . view in the menu Settings under the point of can@@ al@@ view : settings
&quot; the speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . so , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played . it includes the notes , the speed , speed , &amp; etc . . this can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians playing the same notes in a very different way . &quot;
&quot; well , I can force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a Bin@@ ding distribution ( r@@ pm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; have happened because &amp; k@@ mid ; no need to eliminate the problem you need to download a source distribution and install ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s home ) &quot;
&quot; I would like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add any files individually . &quot;
&quot; that is intended to support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; Drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; par@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; before , enable us to activate the setting of automation addition to the collection . otherwise , the files are added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can run the arrow key on the left from the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow the playback . to restore the default temp@@ o you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
&quot; I have at one &amp; D ; -@@ desktop , a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this work space ( if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or t@@ acked ( if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or I want to play a file , just into the &amp; par@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; if you only want to listen to a file quick , without adding them straight to a collection , turn off the adjustment addition to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection of added files . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ -@@ Only you only want to play the first file . so set the setting of automatic addition to the collection and open A.@@ C. your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file . &quot;
then join also to record B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . all thank you ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ates me this , further to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ zur@@ es ; I studied mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; I &apos;m trying to take a lot of time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to collect a bit of time . as hob@@ bies I have collecting programming , making music and prove things . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ a@@ oke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid , or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ ch @ ar@@ ra@@ kis@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; I really make a huge pleasure when you send me a postcard from your home or an MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . all of which send me a postcard or a MIDI file , but if you want to send me a MIDI file , but you should contact me because I might have the file . &quot;
I &apos;ve written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and anybody else got money for it . I would therefore like to emphasize that I only have to program something more because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wai and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - recti@@ fying the error that the sound height was too high in awe @-@ cards .
&quot; thanks also to Jose L@@ us San@@ chez for testing the CIS support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia , Ern@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Magn@@ us pepper , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Wolfgang Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , a fault , or even a supportive email . &quot;
&quot; and of course , my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net , giving us these wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files . &quot;
&quot; additionally , &amp; k@@ mid ; also can be found on his homepage , which is located under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ kis@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ k / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can watch the development , search information and look at the pictures there . you will also find links to sites with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc . &quot;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or a remote synthes@@ izer since the sound quality depends much on your sound@@ card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an awe @-@ card card .
&quot; if you have no sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; using the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , please contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send a bug reports directly to me . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files of the formats of M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website to new versions or to send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list .
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the playlist . and finally , there is a window window that is displayed only when information is displayed in it . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to split the preferred links below the reading mark , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played by one another , you should use the category permanent playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy . if you click on an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and the reproduction begins with the customized entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; updated piece &apos; , television and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course you can only do it if &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; not running . the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / , can also select from the menu View . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content is displayed this part . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , it must be selected from the menu abbrevi@@ ation with playlist and either selected the processing mode , or choose another category . &quot;
&quot; all changes are lost if the processing mode , or another group is selected without the playlist . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .. &quot;
&quot; the animation at starting and end can be disabled by editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ w@@ c and amendment of &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / share / share / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ m@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation when starting does not need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . this would be annoying at the end of the animation , the user can end the application a second time . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a start @-@ animation may be the display of a favourite photos : &amp; lt ; hang@@ ed ; &amp; / / home / K@@ oos : / / / home / k@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; in the directory tests / some examples of SM@@ IL that are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are supported in the directory . &quot;
&quot; there is a tab for the configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here , the path can be set by the M@@ player and the ca@@ che size of the data stream from the network and other things . &quot;
another tool for troubles@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this playback device in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ w@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&quot; &quot; &quot; Flash &apos;@@ can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted the special field @-@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML . &quot;
&quot; so that the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; can reproduce in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player , module must be specified as a service provider for the m@@ ime type virus / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in ordering dialog by K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can be accessed in a consoles application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . the prot@@ rac@@ ted process is called p@@ p@@ player . if there is no mistakes , the back@@ end output within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; this is always a pre @-@ given back@@ end for a particular m@@ ime type ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by manual change the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ w@@ c . for example , phon@@ on is to be re@@ activated all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be viewed , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Re@@ order ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player , the dialog will be used in the settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port . where ports should be detected ( e.g. , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR can only use X@@ video support from k@@ m@@ player , X@@ video should work ( probably this kind of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server needs to be functional . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 servers , it must contain the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) , which must be the following : &quot;
&quot; internally used by KM@@ Player for the sources used different names . at the time of emergence of this documentation these are dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , external source , source source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ ailing source . if they are activated , they start playing the playlist . &quot;
are there tips about how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / CD@@ ROM can be done as user root after inser@@ ting the device . it is absolutely certain to make sure that / dev / CD@@ ROM shows on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
&quot; X@@ ine only starts slowly , why does every time my CPU must be checked on their performance ? &quot;
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ ly . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last recorded value , only the first time x@@ ine is checked the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is required for comp@@ iling from &amp; ki@@ le ;
l@@ atex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems is likely to be traced to the package &amp; text ; or ex @-@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
&quot; most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux , distribution . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation disc should be used . &quot;
the &amp; ki@@ le ; -@@ Project includes some already compiled packages of &amp; ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow a simple installation without further comp@@ iling and are located on the ki@@ le ; website .
&quot; this hand@@ book is for everyone - irrespective of their experiences with l@@ atex ; , &amp; k@@ ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux . &quot;
&quot; advanced users should hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation should be taken into account . however , the support for this project or documentation should be made in contact with the ki@@ le ; website . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions about or when the comp@@ iling of &amp; ki@@ le ; on or become extensions desired , this should be addressed to the mailing list ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ environment for the &amp; D ; -@@ desktop . additionally , offers the possibility to complete use of all &amp; l@@ atex ; additional functions in a graphical interface and within these a simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made tools for this . finally , the easy to use assistant , the &amp; l@@ atex ; reference and powerful project management . &quot;
to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and his options should learn the manual for K@@ ate . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter work using the editor of &amp; K@@ ate ; begin with the reading of the chapter .
for l@@ atex ; is the right expression : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . to use the ur@@ ring &amp; tex ; difficult to use is also a La@@ ie ( engl@@ .@@ L@@ ay ) &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ mac@@ ros is possible that it is derived from the surname of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
&quot; here is just a good overview of &amp; l@@ atex ; given here , it is not the ultimate book to it . to rule out correctly there should be good balls for example H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ AL@@ Y , A Guide to &amp; l@@ atex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ r . &quot;
&quot; just as other audio @-@ fixing agreements also includes &amp; l@@ atex ; an introduction , with which the general characteristics , such as paper format , page numbered , and text numbers are specified with the command \ \ document@@ class , the downside starts with the command \ \ abstract { document } and must be closed using the command \ \ \ &apos; { document } . &quot;
&quot; the quick @-@ entry assistant of &amp; ki@@ le ; is a simple function for quick creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; and the selection of the document ( menu ) offers some possibilities for the creation of the document . you can also select some of the settings related to the document . &quot;
&quot; document classes : this is hereby the type of document issued : article ( article ) , Book &#91; book &#93; , Report &#91; letter &#93; , Report &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; letter &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; Ad@@ verse &#93; , Book ( DIN ) &#91; Ad@@ verse &#93; , Proj@@ ector &#91; E@@ ther@@ er &#93; , films &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user defined . &quot;
co@@ ding : this is set the character enco@@ ding . it should use the string codi@@ fication of the system . modern systems are increasingly using UT@@ F @-@ 8 enco@@ ding as standard . best , the UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ x should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ documents ) . &quot;
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ packages for l@@ atex ; for the integration they are merely displayed in the cross @-@ crossing field .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) : the document@@ aries of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( for compliance with German DIN regulations ) . you should always find the use of German texts . &quot;
new users are not worried about this . only a brief description of the functions and more detailed information can be given in the section .
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; - as well as other source text editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the fitting ) . through &amp; ki@@ le ; however , it is likely to remind you that any mathematical environment is not closed . however , it is possible thanks to the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will save you through the high@@ lighting time and stretch out . &quot;
&quot; with automatic re@@ handling of the environments , by entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically a blank line ( for the input of the text ) and the remaining line to the closing of the command ( e.g. \ \ \ end { command } ) . setup ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled . &quot;
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; l@@ atex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most common and subtle element ) :
&quot; in view of the document in structure , the individual elements can be exchanged and viewed by a mouse @-@ click on the respective one . &quot;
&quot; for creating your own &amp; l@@ atex ; files can be very helpful in creating your own &amp; l@@ atex ; file &#91; read@@ just &#93; file ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ ro File ) &#93; , navig@@ ating &amp; ki@@ le ; given a click with the middle mouse button in the DV@@ I ; code for the appropriate line in the l@@ atex ; source code . &quot;
&quot; a DV@@ I ; file contained a description of the form@@ at@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is adjacent to PDF , the output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; there are many tools to view , conversion and printing of DV@@ I ; files for various systems and services . &quot;
&quot; the elements of the DV@@ I ; file with the editor are t@@ apped , and as soon as an element in the DV@@ I ; file code was scr@@ apped , the exact opposite is shortened . as soon as to a section in the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code was cool@@ ed to the corresponding location in DV@@ I ; -@@ viewer . &quot;
&quot; master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a Master document the work is simplified with other .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide Master document can be set to project settings . &quot;
quick construction : the &amp; l@@ atex ; code text is compiled and the result will be displayed automatically ( if no errors in the source code is available ) .
&quot; file aer@@ ators : in this mode the DV@@ I ; file on the n@@ der@@ ement@@ s@@ â , on the part , and it is not a call by &amp; oc@@ ular ; after the quick@@ ening . &quot;
&quot; in tracking the editing tool@@ bar , the three crude parts should be stri@@ ped out . the selection fields were designed for quick breakdown of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; l@@ atex ; commands for the sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the selection box is for addition of articles such as tags , fox , notes , or references . the options available are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command , a description for a section , image or other element is created . &quot;
reference : is used for reference to a fixed term ( selection of a selection range ) .
&quot; using quote will be displayed a selective list with literary settings . for &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are necessary for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors . the author has good experiences with &amp; c@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; b ; the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can be written by hand also in &amp; ki@@ le ; by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last drop @-@ down with the name Gr@@ Ã © is used for setting up the font . it can be set up the font to the main text , which can be fixed , etc . , the following font styles are available : &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; ki@@ le ; there are two choices available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and fixed settings . 2 . the document may be written from scratch . &quot;
&quot; the brack@@ ets according to the command \ \ document@@ Class included the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; lays the font . if the writing is not specified at the beginning , this can also be carried out in the text . &quot;
once the above source code has to be entered the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code is compiled . the easiest way for this is the use of building construction or but@@ ton@@ ing .
the code text must be saved in front of the comp@@ iling . &amp; ki@@ le ; while the storage is automatically saved .
&quot; the comp@@ iling of the document was missing , should be searched in the log in accordance with errors . when using quick construction , &amp; oc@@ ular should be started automatically . if this is not the case , should also be noticed . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( English environment ) is a text which is different from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font should have created a different font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ , and \ \ end { Exten@@ sion } . &quot;
&quot; the passages are only available within the environment ( from \ \ , begin } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there are no preced@@ ents in an environment . &quot;
&quot; there are many possibilities for heating of read@@ ability and usability of the document . for example , certain fonts , fat , finger@@ print , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands may either end with the command \ \ , or automatically at the end of the surrounding area . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the course of course and is long as long as he is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be portra@@ yed with \ \ &apos; { word } .
\ \ &apos; quote : creates a quotation in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { ratio } and ends with \ \ end { ratio } .
&quot; after the background to writing the source text with the &amp; l@@ atex ; displays language , now a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; &quot;
&quot; once a bit of text was entered in the wizard , some adap@@ tations should be taken for the better read@@ ability of the document . for this , a quotation , a few spots in the fat and spa print and a poem to apply to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , using editor @-@ view or str@@ g E can return to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , its windows must be closed . &quot;
&quot; once the DV@@ I ; file has been created , the document may be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script file . simply try and spa@@ wn out . &quot;
DV@@ I ; is a small file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ ang@@ ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi issue such as printer : / PDF _ trans@@ cript or computer screen .
for printing a &amp; DV@@ I ; file the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . on the 7th step - after clicking on DV@@ I can be printed ( if the printer is correctly adjusted ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DV@@ I ; file into other formats . once the DV@@ I ; file from the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code was created , the conversion will begin using the buttons in tool@@ bar . &quot;
the pres@@ sions allows a direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DV@@ I ; file .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; l@@ atex ; there must be only Modern under settings Ki@@ le setup ... tools B@@ auen can be exploited .
&quot; to prepare the pre @-@ search form , the mouse cursor must be positioned in a row of the source text and should be clicked on pre @-@ search on pre @-@ search results . the jump to the appropriate place in DV@@ I ; -@@ viewer will then be given . &quot;
with this function in &amp; oc@@ ular@@ line ; document the appropriate &amp; l@@ atex with a click of the middle mouse button on the DV@@ I ; document and click on the appropriate line ; there must be specified in &amp; oc@@ ular ; used as text editor ( settings Ok@@ ular@@ line ... Editor )
&quot; should the case of quick@@ ening of the &amp; DV@@ I ; viewer does not exist , a bug can be available . if a bug is available , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the log file will be the fault source in the source code . in the editor you can always see the line in error . in order to look at the wrong line , the log file must be clicked on the error in the log file , and ti@@ ki@@ le ; jump to the faul@@ ty line . &quot;
&quot; as soon as in the appropriate button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to choose from the template for the document . the options listed are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting one document , a document may be used either from scratch or the wizard for fast creation of a new document . further information can be included in the section . &quot;
&quot; number of users of l@@ atex ; mostly use the same introduction for virtually all documents . templates &quot; &quot; can be stored in &amp; ki@@ le ; templates , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either create an existing &amp; tex ; - / l@@ atex ; file name or a new file may be created . &amp; ki@@ le ; can create a new template using the layout of an existing document and selection of file templates . &quot;
when creating a new document from a template using File New character sets are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character enco@@ ding ) . these variables can set up in settings Ki@@ le ... settings General .
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which string chains are replaced by which variables : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ C@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is used by entering in document class . typically it will be used as : \ \ document@@ ations &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ C@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; .
&quot; the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard , and the associated inser@@ ting of the commands in the editor . once the document was created in this way , the following steps were accomplished : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , your own template can be displayed instead of default . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any l@@ atex ; files creates a simple way to create a template , should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described above . &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; used &amp; K@@ ate ; used as an internal editor . &amp; K@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting from many different types of text files ( including &amp; l@@ atex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for example are made directly out of &amp; ki@@ le ;
&quot; to learn more about K@@ ate &amp; K@@ ate , and to learn his abilities , the manual should get her@@ ni@@ fied to K@@ ate . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter , using the Editor of &amp; K@@ ate ; begin with the reading of the chapter . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; offers a very practical &amp; l@@ atex ; command reference , which can be accessed over the help of La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a dedicated description of virtually all commands that can be found in &amp; l@@ atex ; use the syntax . &quot;
&quot; a double @-@ clicking with penetr@@ ated str@@ g key , select the &amp; tex ; word meaning that in this way with clicking \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ . &quot;
&quot; when pulling the text with the left mouse button , the text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow , with ge@@ ck@@ eted um@@ bs , you can choose parts of the source text in the editing window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse the various kinds of source texts , and to note these . for example , the &amp; l@@ atex ; - commands from normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ ae are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many assistants can provide exclusive ski marks . this is a unique type of book@@ mark within the text . this is also highlighted the jump to the smallest or the last jumping brand . thereby , this jumping brand is highlighted , so that it is automatically detected at the first input of a character . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; ki@@ le ; however , although excellent features have been added in &amp; l@@ atex ; essential functions for writing a &amp; l@@ atex ; special commands may contain the following commands to text selection : &quot;
&quot; a complete paragraph includes a whole paragraph ( group of lines that contain on both sides a blank line ) . with a paragraph , it is not a text with a clear lines ( as in other text cases ) . the only prev@@ ent@@ ative thing in &amp; ki@@ le ; thus , it is that the abbrevi@@ ation can be separated by two blank lines . &quot;
&quot; choose the word under the current curve @-@ position . this selection also has an extended meaning , as this command also includes a l@@ atex ; commands , with a total surface area ( \ \ ) and an extra star ( * ) . &quot;
&quot; for example , a part of the document can be removed naturally , and by pressing the button de@@ f . &amp; K@@ ate ; offers the keyboard with own commands , which includes a faster possibility . below Edit removal are the following commands to the text of the text include : &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; ki@@ le ; is included in the description of the Edi@@ tors paragraph .
it has already been noted that environments play a central role in l@@ atex ; therefore offers &amp; ki@@ le ; for NF further commands in editing environment for easy work with &amp; l@@ atex ;
this command is j@@ umped to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to the steering of the surroundings .
&quot; this command will be j@@ umped to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) , the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the closure of the area . &quot;
&quot; if the cursor is placed before or within the command \ \ begin { area } , the end of the surroundings will be j@@ umped ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many wel@@ ded ambient commands can be lost quickly , the most recent example . this command arose the most recently paved ambient , so that the wast@@ e@@ ed ambient structure does not exist . &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; l@@ atex ; groups that are determined by br@@ aces { ... } are a few important commands that suit those from editing environment .
this command is split up to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the brack@@ et brack@@ et .
&quot; with this command will be j@@ umped to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) , the cursor is placed directly behind the wel@@ ded brack@@ et . &quot;
&quot; if the cursor appears before or behind the wel@@ ded brack@@ et of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is , becomes the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; in the entry of many wel@@ ded groups brack@@ ets can quickly go over into the ground . this command arose , the most recently paved group , so that the dev@@ oured structure of the &amp; tex ; groups are not stri@@ ved . &quot;
in &amp; l@@ atex ; two simple instructions are used as hall@@ mark . for the purpose of applying is used in &amp; ki@@ le ; the character &quot; for two easy to use is used . &quot;
this automatic filing of double occupancy can set up under settings Ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X - and be painted .
&quot; there may also be L@@ Ã ¼ n@@ der@@ specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) and thus German or fran@@ chis@@ el signs are used . there are also many more languages available . &quot;
&quot; when crossing the Shift key down , there is a smart poin@@ ter . if the current position is located within a lists of lists ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , for example , this current position is available , but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; inside a tables environment , t &amp; ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &quot;
even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to provide l@@ atex or l@@ atex ; - or user @-@ defined environments to be supported by settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
&quot; some operators need to arrange columns in tables and thereby all e@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; ki@@ le ; tries to encourage this . while this t@@ ator is , not the remaining t@@ ator , to add &amp; ki@@ le ; some intermediate space for the columns of the current tab@@ ul@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; K@@ ate ; already provides a good source code completion , this was added in &amp; ki@@ le ; for special orders ( mostly for &amp; l@@ atex ; ) are still extended . all these modes can be set for different ways of working under settings Ki@@ le ... to be completed . &quot;
at the beginning a new environment means by the command \ \ begin { surroundings } &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically the command \ \ end { surroundings } added to an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; when crossing the bar , the last letter of the input will be removed and you can deny the complete list . on the other hand , the list by entering another letter can also be smaller . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions can be dropped by &amp; ki@@ le ; alternatively the jumping brands can be added , so that a simple jump to these positions can be accessed via Edit j@@ as@@ k@@ ste jumping brand and the frau@@ dul@@ ent parameters can then be classified . &quot;
&quot; beneath settings ki@@ le ; set ... ki@@ le ; complete settings to these lists are made . there can be different wool lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; l@@ atex ; - commands , as well as laundry , of general language use . &quot;
&quot; the command mode is not available for completion of environments . it is always a few letters to be entered with \ \ \ . on the other hand , the environments are often used with ambient temperatures . on the other hand , the environments are so often used that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for completion of the environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the completion mode , the command to complete the internal environment or the short@@ listed is called Alt + Shift key , the command to the steering is automatically repaired and it appears \ \ begin . afterwards the ambient temperature can be termin@@ ated and by dr@@ ush the input taste . &quot;
&quot; after this has been accomplished , the environment will be closed automatically . once &amp; ki@@ le ; realize that it is a list environment , is even a first \ \ item command . &quot;
&quot; settings ki@@ le ; set ... ki@@ le ; complete settings to these lists are made . this mode uses the possibility of default mode for use , - and l@@ atex ; - commands . &quot;
&quot; set up user @-@ defined lists of abbrevi@@ ations , which are immediately replaced by default strings . as an example of a subscription list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ wl , where for example , the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L entered and the word processor is introduced , the letter L is replaced by the string chain \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; crude is not helpful for automatic susp@@ ects , however , has been found that many calves in a document can be written more than once . so that offers &amp; ki@@ le ; the completion of all already written keys . &quot;
&quot; this mode can set up in the menu of Ki@@ le ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ tically shiel@@ ds , here too , can also be specified for the display of the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; the vertical files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / bar@@ le / das / ser / ser / ser / ser / ser / ser / ser / mode ) , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ Ã ¼ r@@ ence ) , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ Ã ¼ r@@ er@@ book ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the dialog diagrams are shaped the layout of graphics as easy as possible . to the central view of the graphics , the sections should be considered and noted . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an excellent base for cap@@ tions and re@@ arrangement of pages . if the PDF issue is possible , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; post@@ script ; -@@ tools can be re@@ arranged and then converted with p@@ s@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to watch the results of the work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the menus , create conver@@ sions and create a view . &quot;
&quot; for the comp@@ iling of the source text by viewer , like &amp; oc@@ ular ; or the other transformation may be used the key@@ chain using Alt ; 3 considered by old ; 4 the DV@@ I ; file into a PS file is converted and by old ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the command is quick@@ ening , normally a viewer is called after the comp@@ iling . should not be used an integrated viewer , each window will open a new window each time . &quot;
a new project will be asked about the project &apos;s new project .... here the following information for the project is asked :
&quot; when selecting the fil@@ en@@ ame @-@ window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ ki@@ lep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; ki@@ le ; allows the allocation of EC@@ MA@@ Script -@@ code . the scripts can be administr@@ ated across the script .
the API scripts are not yet end@@ lessly developed and can be used in further versions of &amp; ki@@ le ;
&quot; first , it has to be said that the recording environment of the scripts in &amp; ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = ki@@ le ) with the following methods have : &quot;
&quot; l@@ atex ; is quite a small system , in which basic functions can be expanded through a variety of additional packages . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different assistance to support users . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are delivered with many documents . included in this includes a documentation for the included packages , and another l@@ atex ; reference . &quot;
&quot; a full speaker for wel@@ d &amp; tex ; and report on the Fre@@ un@@ de@@ â , but rather it is a complete user manual for the &amp; l@@ atex ; but this is ideal for searching for a certain form@@ atting . since this is a very large document , it is set in &amp; ki@@ le ; divided into three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents containing &amp; Tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tual , the fin@@ den of the right document is not always easy . as common help offers &amp; Tet@@ ex ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k to provide a database with all the available documents and includes a graphic super@@ structure supplied . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the advantage is the search for parcel name or stroke . of &amp; ki@@ le ; then only the results are displayed .
a double @-@ click with the mouse or the an@@ tigen of space @-@ taste the viewer for the document .
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ eventh and user @-@ friendly &amp; l@@ atex ; - / tex ; source text is available for different architec@@ tures of &amp; Linux ; - and Unix shell ; is also part of the Fink project , thus making &amp; ki@@ le ; also available on &amp; Mac ; with installed on &amp; Mac . &quot;
&quot; much thanks to those who asp@@ ire after the continuation of the &amp; ki@@ le ; project endeav@@ ours to sacrifice many hours for the development of tools , which we can all use under consideration of the GNU / GNU ; latest information on the contribut@@ ors is available in the men@@ Ã ¼ e &amp; ki@@ le ; &quot;

&quot; output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted every time , when mein@@ pro@@ c will be started . &quot;
&quot; as already said , anyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already worked , know how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , there is now a great graphical surface for it . &quot;
&quot; if the just opened file inde@@ x.@@ do@@ book is , then they simply leave the current level sub@@ folder . if not , then select current work @-@ folders and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ do@@ book is available . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to an output on the screen , their file is flawless . please check the related errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , then the current file is simply cro@@ oked up . if not , they delete the tick on the current file and select the file using other file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you only want to know if the file is well @-@ free , they press the Well @-@ wheel review . &quot;

&quot; if the file should be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , it should be highlighted , then they just let the current file be selected . if not , remove the selected file and select the file &apos;s file by means of the other file file selection . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result should have named , the file is usually saved in their home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , have walked , have little to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; even so , the plug @-@ in system is very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone can use the wish in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens . more about it can be found below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug @-@ in or a tile , we start with the menu plug @-@ ins . this way , the following dialogue will be opened : &quot;
this dialog enables to manage all the contained plugins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
&quot; here you can enter the search box . for adding plug @-@ ins without a location , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; this path to search of plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; often working on a project several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , giving support of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties are configured . &quot;
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Ni@@ ck@@ name is the nickname of the user and serves to clear identification .
one member may have several roles in the project like team@@ leader as well as sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can look out from the list of members of the team members who he is . this happens when he pus@@ hes the team member from the list and pus@@ hes the button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears f@@ ett after that you are : text .
nickname and setting of your own identity are important regarding news and notes . see for further information on remarks .
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage by recording the members of the team : it can be created an event to the information to team members , if something particular takes place . see for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are carried out if something particular takes place in the project . an example would be able to record the opening of the project , or sending a message when a file is saved , or a script that creates a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the page event configuration of the Shift , F@@ 7 project project settings Di@@ alo@@ ges can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email will be sent to the addres@@ see in the recipient list . the addres@@ see can be a team or sub@@ project leader . see how such ladder can be set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
&quot; type comments is simple . it can be selected either the note -@@ entry from the editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary box , followed by a feature text . &quot;
&quot; notes can be sent a determin@@ able member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , the nickname of the included nickname of the team project should be given the corresponding range of departments or sub@@ project names , as in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nickname and roll@@ ers names are independent of large @-@ scale or small @-@ scale , but spaces around the br@@ aces and the : make the note invalid . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is a development environment for scripts and form@@ atting languages , which is supported D@@ T@@ D diagnostic and web @-@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages . &quot;
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in . &quot;
&quot; the settings can be set up by settings Qu@@ anta , etc . this dialog covers some pages that will be treated succes@@ sively . &quot;
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed . the entries are :
&quot; large / scale of tags : large / small file of automatic inserted tags . normal wholesale / small file means , the tags are inserted as inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / small inc@@ ess@@ ays of attributes : large / small@@ ish of automatically added attributes . normal young / to@@ dd@@ ling means , the attributes are inserted as inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically conclude : if requested , is optional for tags , for which the final day is optional , this immediately after the bed ; inserted . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically include : as above , for all other tags with the exception of simple tags . &quot;
starting and conclusion @-@ day automatically update : if switched on the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic filing of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the appropriate co@@ ding during one inser@@ tion .
m@@ ime types : mim@@ osa types for detection of different types of files . by using the default standard the default ones can be restored .
standard character enco@@ ding : the co@@ ding of newly created or in other way than with file opening open files ( where the co@@ ding of the file can be over@@ thrown ) . this setting is eliminated from the same in the projection Properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard D@@ T@@ D : the selected D@@ T@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ T@@ D has not been recognized . however , this setting is eliminated from the same into the properties tab , if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul created regular backup copies , so that in a black@@ out or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as the saving of the file . also for not stored documents a backup is regularly created , according to the time provided . &quot;
&quot; the preview and the documentation can be shown either in the editor &apos;s &quot; &quot; Edi@@ tors &quot; &quot; ( or documentation ) , which makes it possible to look at the documentation , the preview , and the source code at the same time . &quot;
set the window controls back at the next start is useful when the user interface through modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views inter@@ connected . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout command @-@ line parameters .
the warning @-@ section serves the taxes of the possibility to shut up the ad of warnings due to the risk of non @-@ question .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code in the shared mode can be specified .
&quot; here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which depic@@ ts the illustration of the Par@@ ser knot@@ s in the document , which details will be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse @-@ click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change the sol@@ dered action by clicking the structural tree with the mouse @-@ mol@@ ded action . &quot;
&quot; in the area of structural configuration settings , the visibility of knot@@ s in the tree can be adjusted automatically when editing and how deep in changing the structure tree should be adjusted automatically . empty knot@@ s are the empty spaces in the text , while empty groups are such , where the current document has not been found . &quot;
&quot; the area for placing abbrevi@@ ations ( a kind of templates ) that can be un@@ folded with editing to large @-@ scale text . abbrevi@@ ations are in groups , each one can specify for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means it can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ den@@ wald abbrevi@@ ation is something different than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plugins are your part @-@ applications from the third party , which can be re@@ used by every particle @-@ capable application , most known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . in inser@@ ting an plug @-@ in , the following are to be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it does not lie at a standard station like $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
&quot; input : this information will be passed to the plug @-@ in at the start , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; component into &quot; &quot; Only @-@ L@@ esis &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in does not deny the store . only @-@ L@@ ese K@@ parts usually refuse to charge if this option is not chosen . &quot;
&quot; check out the plugin : if this enabled , then tested &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; if the given information is correct . select the storing in the moment is not available , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; from version 3.3 , the troubles@@ hooting was completely re@@ developed . Die@@ z was hired , as well as support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ Plugin was implemented , which allows various implement@@ ations about plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul . &quot;
&quot; using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ ins in the project settings . with the button options next to the de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ Plugin , the specific settings may be changed . &quot;
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ oto &apos;s interface : &quot;
a view in which the contents of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
&quot; a view , in which all brack@@ ets , with character numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is normally shown in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if required , or it shares the plugin to listen to debit requirements . this action is triggered by default , when a project is opened , so it does not normally need to be respected . &quot;
the counterpart to de@@ bu@@ gging session starts the session . includes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the leaves according to requirements .
send a HTTP request to the server for a debit requirement . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to look at the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger edition .
&quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger , with the execution of the script to start and information on the monitoring variables as well as the currently posted on continuously . if this happens when the script is stopped , the execution goes on before a debit card will start , starts the script with the request . &quot;
&quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger , pointing to the execution of the script , without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number . when this happens , the execution continues . it happens before a debit card begins , the execution begins once a requirement is made . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger introduces the next statement to the script without taking into the functions or features .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger introduces the next statement to the script , with if possible in functions and includes in@@ def@@ ective . &quot;
points the de@@ bu@@ gger to move the statement and move to the next one as if there were not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered that is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
this dialog can be entered a variable or set a new value of a variable .

&quot; document Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , to provide support for market and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; to provide you with ease and flexibility . their simplicity and flexibility makes out &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; simple , user @-@ friendly , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; s &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and CSS . day folder are made up of two parts , the tag folder and the tool@@ box . day folder are hand @-@ focused , symbolic gro@@ wers of sc@@ rap ( above the Edi@@ te @-@ window ) to insert the text and instructions faster in a document than a user ever could . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ T@@ D . see for details on the conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; Pat@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool @-@ making . short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; day XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the Fe@@ atur@@ es@@ alo@@ ges , the &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ie@@ . it contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it does allow a fast inser@@ ting of tags in a document without a danger of ty@@ pe@@ writer . &quot;
&quot; day folder are nothing but a folder . they contain only the &amp; fl@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the tag@@ XML files . day folder carry the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares as they are necessary , or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible to allow other users to gain better insight and more information when working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limitations is presented in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a day XML document . it can contain only once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains only one element type about yourself . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when using it &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for type Meth@@ od . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a single attribute and the attributes within these tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ tag . this is an only element type item .
&quot; describe an attribute of a tag . this item can only happen once for each attribute . additionally , it contains other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is an only element -@@ type item . &quot;
indicates the used source text used for the attributes for the attributes in the tag @-@ Edi@@ tor@@ dialog and in the attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p methodology within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; used to achieve the source of data .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a methodology . the arguments that are handed over to the method . may be empty or % day @-@ name % , which means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container tag that group@@ ed the elements of a list together . it can only occur for an attribute . it is an only element type item .
sets the position of the attribute of a tag within a dialogue . this day may occur for each attribute in a dialogue only once ( e.g. once for each &amp; one ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ tag ) . the element is empty .
gives the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; und &amp; lt ; label &gt; Day ) . this item is empty .
gives a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this item is an only one element type .
gives a list of elements that end a day . this item is just one element type .
all day XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration must start ; ? XML version = 1.0 En@@ co@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be tidy and closed properly .
&quot; spaces do not affect anything , but watch out &amp; lt , characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; text &gt; text &gt; text &gt; , and some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog on top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens will be able to start and check out Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . one more dialogue will appear to follow its simple instructions . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently not available yet . at present , the check is only done at the loading of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ oto . &quot;
in the following an example of a family 1 day XML file . this file describes it &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; element of the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
&quot; following an example of a functioning family 2 tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP file is described . the file name of this tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; s &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ co@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; day = &quot; &quot; re@@ load &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; re@@ load &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; &gt; &gt; &amp; lt , / day &gt; &amp; lt , / day &gt; &quot;
the &amp; Pat@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor to reach via D@@ T@@ D Bear@@ be@@ ite D@@ T@@ D settings . this allows di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following contracts :
&#91; general &#93; version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ T@@ D statement = / / D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ T@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified the name is used as Ni@@ ck@@ name .
an action can set up with settings . click on New action leads to the same dialog :
this action stri@@ pped keyboard short@@ cut . by clicking the user interface it can be assigned to a short@@ cut ; with K@@ one is the current short@@ cut short@@ cut .
the simplest actions . there can be a text inserted in the det@@ ects settings and in execution of the action this text is inserted in the document on the current cursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the powerful action type . with the help of this action you can use external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that can change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , themselves are the Quick start -@@ Dialogue or the different See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : S@@ H / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / qu@@ anta / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts in their path : $ path There are other special variable that can be used in the command line : &quot;
&quot; % f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name . &quot;
&quot; % pi@@ d : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ oto ; only one instance runs , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ COP to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul is used by the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
in addition to the above listed methods a script can take entries of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; at default . in the selection input can be determined what to send to default . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected range of the document will be sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the downloaded application can also be diver@@ ted . there are two types of issue : normal edition , written on the default output ; error messages to be done with the text written on the default output is set by the value the selection issue is set : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags in logical groups . in the case it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add actions and configure . select Settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all the necessary fields and add it to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete everything and , in case the day attributes has attributes and you are planning to use their use , activate &quot; &quot; Edit &quot; &quot; to edit , if available so that an entry when using the action is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is that a ugly symbol . who should remember the action with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulties .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , chart More programs ( or where else it is located in its distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose any size others . &quot;
&quot; note that the created symbol not only helps you remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a starter button as a symbol . by the use of green ( green is usually interpreted as los , rigi@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled ; start@@ led ; -@@ day in the current document will be added . &quot;
&quot; after the creation of the symbol it must still be connected to the action . this happens through the menu with settings , set ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; ) and selecting the desired action . besides the text field is one button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the application button and continue with other tags , so there &apos;s still what , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to complement some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pers ; -@@ functions for tool@@ bar , or it should adjust it to a better overview by some separ@@ ators in multiple groups . open the tool@@ bar and set up dialog on settings tool@@ bar . make sure that the desired tool@@ bar is selected . &quot;
&quot; I would like to select the denomin@@ ator ( quite left above ) for my tool@@ bar . according to the selection of the element , which is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow buttons to the right . this adds the element to tool@@ bar . &quot;
for example I want to preview a quick option of access to the par@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add the tool@@ bar .
&quot; please note how the Tr@@ enner does not support group@@ ing . anyone who knows my tool@@ bar , could believe that the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start button . &quot;
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by using all symbols to make sure everything works .
&quot; secure in the correct folder . after re@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be in@@ regular folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder , so that your tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded ( n ) if a file is opened by the appropriate type . &quot;
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; for normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ atting language that you like most . therefore this chapter describes how I make a &amp; PHP ; -@@ document tree for my personal use .
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; repository , if any one has done it for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you must create an existing documentation for the form@@ atting / script / etc ; language . then you have to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . we will leave the second part with you , the second we treat it here . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc . = path , relative to this file , for example ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top Level = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 4.1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ html 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 4.1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ html 2 = 3 2.@@ html 2 = tag 2.@@ html 2 = tag 2.@@ html 2 = tag 3.@@ html 2 = tag 3.@@ html 2 = tag 3.@@ html &quot;
&quot; the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see the &amp; PHP documentation : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = Table of content , # Test@@ ting Star@@ ted = Adver@@ ting Star@@ ted = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syndrome .@@ html ... &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Re@@ ference . this indicates that there is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for the chess engine ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the index directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequ@@ ential at the top of the building control &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be shown ! ) .
space influence nothing but watch on &amp; und &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; resources are replaced .
&quot; the content of the content is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file which is intended for the design of the context @-@ sensitive aid . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; H for context @-@ aid , the documentation would be shown directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text List ) and the file @-@ linking lines . &quot;
a simple list of separated context @-@ elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c simply by $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as specified in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
&quot; if you are sure these are good and worth to be shared , submit your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , for example what documentation is used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ oto ; -@@ Re@@ pository , for the use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; community . you will not be rich , but proud to have been proud of having worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; you are not alone . it is possible to divide the depar@@ ting resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ making with promotions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; resources can be sent by means of e @-@ mail to friends , partners or otherwise . at different places there is an email notification , such as D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pers ; users can download them . the contributions are checked and only available if our team needs them as accurate and user @-@ free for publication . thus , the source of resources ensures that there is a GP@@ G / P@@ GP key . thus , the source of resources is ensured , both for our team and for later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you will be asked for their private GP@@ G key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can have a look . in the dialog New resource will need to stay empty ) and with click OK the up@@ loading will be started . &quot;
&quot; the up@@ loading can upload from the menus D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool tool@@ bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , even before installation , examines &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signature . in case of problems it can be warns . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the specification of the origin@@ ator of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages , which currently is not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; the creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of day files can be necessary in tag XML format . there is the simpler way to convert a D@@ T@@ D automatically to a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started from the D@@ T@@ D loading and conver@@ sions of a D@@ T@@ D . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ T@@ D description , which is to be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears : &quot;
target directories : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
&quot; DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE definition : the string , which is published in the ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tag , like HTML Public - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loo@@ se@@ .@@ d@@ t@@ d &quot;
&quot; setting the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; following the transformation of the &amp; Pat@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , there are some key concepts . to understand this and get full benefit from &amp; agon@@ izing ; this chapter attempts to get familiar with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to bring them exactly these concepts without understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ oto ; little benefit . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and project @-@ related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ oto . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available to anyone who is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens . utilizing tools is all that is marked as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; this enables the group of administrators to ensure different tool@@ sets , actions and patterns in the global tree allow each to be available in a multi @-@ user environment on the system . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web developers for a single user . these are custom patterns and tool@@ making . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be all from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns to tool@@ ing with special promotions , specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which is the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the Edi@@ tors window , the man@@ age@@ views , the car@@ tei@@ ites with information and tool@@ making . please beat in , and for more information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the diamond plate with the right mouse button , to re@@ charge a context menu with the current documents , re @-@ load , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click on the editing range , lead to a further context menu regarding the processed documentation section on how basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , editing the file under the mouse cursor or opening the file when the string is called a file under the mouse cursor . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the Edi@@ tor &apos;s tool@@ bar , the tool@@ bar is located . currently , &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as a standard for which a set of machine tools is shown . in the course of the further construction of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , the tool@@ bar will be adapted to the new functions and associated users . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ making is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; then click on the icon that tag the day . now , you can insert the data for this straight , you can insert in a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; the man@@ age@@ views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navigate in the information on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; navigate , to open and ro@@ am . in the representation of the mapping modules are available for files , project , pattern , documents , scripts , attributes , and documentation . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool , which provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul . this view displays all files in the project and allows the administrator of the files in the project by means of right mouse click . actions like adding , removing , up@@ loading , or del@@ eting the files from storage media can be performed using the contex@@ tual menu . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ lers ; it is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; We are open to all possibilities . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what context they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ oto ; global templates are always available , local templates only available for the relevant user and templates in projects are available only in the project . more to templates is available . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scripts . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project works here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information on a script . on the right mouse button are further functions available , such as the script to start , edit or send by email . &quot;
with this view one shows the internal structure of the active document . by links @-@ clicking an element the cursor in the document is set to the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element it opens up a list of commands in terms of navigation and refres@@ her of the tree .
&quot; this tree appears under the other man@@ age@@ views . with it , maneu@@ ver can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ ace . that allows the content of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here , the complete documentation on the web technology for your development can be found . it can be downloaded pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; &apos; documentation site you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be addressed , edited and viewed . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; two car@@ vings at the bottom of the window can be reached on the usable information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this diamond driver displays information on each in Qu@@ anta current script . such , for example , the D@@ T@@ D of the current document and all changes to the D@@ T@@ D will be shown . &quot;
&quot; this diamond rider shows all the errors in the market @-@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; scripts , which are executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; tool@@ makers are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the respective command . the chocolate bar of the tool@@ bar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; agon@@ izing . &quot;
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with email ; if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can secure these in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; like any other way to secure and load ! &quot;
it is reasonable if you want to adapt the location of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus files on your system . for this purpose auto@@ conf has a number of options to get to the configure script . to see a complete list of options available to the configure script . / configure --@@ help one . the options are easy to understand and not executed .
&quot; if you have problems at starting from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 am folder . also , you should make sure that is not an older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the path before their bin folder . same is true for &amp; Q@@ t . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , became optimized for a quick web development and combines a mat@@ ured development environment with a variety of powerful functions . &quot;
&quot; during the endeavor to create the best &amp; HTML , -@@ Editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul would be ? well , this would make it to the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; now far from the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then you should define &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; therefore the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be . &quot;
&quot; well , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; as follows , in good application of free software , the idea of Why develop , which has already developed anyone else ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; rum@@ ours not only this is possible but allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , to expand how they need it for their need . &quot;
&quot; this allows Web@@ Develop@@ ers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity dramatically . by using com@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ ing , the automation can increase almost every task . through the program compres@@ sor , they can be able to remember without any scripts of scrip@@ ting language . ( more about that they find in . ) &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web development environment designed for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly developed into a well @-@ engineered editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .

&quot; a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not located on it , whereby the oldest entry is taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . look in the section on templates . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ ts when inser@@ ting out of the cli@@ p@@ board , contained special characters to &amp; HTML , advertisement , so that it is displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as form@@ atting instruction . &quot;
conver@@ ts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; advertisement which is the correct way to inser@@ ting special characters and spaces in the URL ; s is primarily used for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s to the anchor day .
&quot; switch the block@@ selection to or from , which allows you to select text @-@ sticks with the help of the &amp; Shift key . &quot;
go directly to a drawing number . this is very helpful if you are your &amp; PHP ; -@@ Script error messages !
&quot; is looking for a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions , in order to help you . &quot;
displays the message window or not . that &apos;s the window in which you see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger .
&quot; initial and switching of problem problems at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , main window . the problem of problem is activated once you change to the structure tree . &quot;
&quot; displays the tool@@ bar left from the main window . this column allows you to set your book@@ mark , with a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu with the entries previous or next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sors in the document . &quot;
book@@ mark from other opened documents appear in the menu group@@ ed according to the fil@@ en@@ ames of other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects are saved with the file C@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory to new files that could be there . this allows for example to copy video files into your project folder or sub@@ folder , and then add it to the project . &quot;
download the files in your project on the server high . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded further input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
&quot; settings , like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; the project is managed . in Chapter &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; projects can be explained the details . &quot;
invites a project @-@ tool@@ bar . these are stored in project You / tool@@ bar and are only assigned in this menu when you have them assigned to this project .
&quot; a dialog to save your machine tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . that creates only the name . actions must be saved through tool@@ ing tool@@ bar , or you will make use of tool@@ ing if you want to save the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; removed a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not del@@ etes it from the disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; team , so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message using the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ sets to the main server , wherever anyone can access it . &quot;
load one &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; who has made you or anyone else and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; own description format .
&quot; re@@ charging / refresh the entities from the &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; it is useful when the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P should be refres@@ hed , without rene@@ wing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write to exist in the global K@@ DE file failed to fail . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags , which are currently available in the currently charged tool . if the default ( html ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is in the tags menu a sub@@ menu Standard that contains the list of tags / promotions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day distribution dialog , if there is one . this entry is always available in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
&quot; activated or de@@ activ@@ ating the intelligent inser@@ ting of tags . currently , this works only with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul does not work using tool@@ bar if this day contradic@@ ts the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plugins are listed under the above listed menu points . click on the activated plug @-@ ins disabled . &quot;
select the par@@ sing panel mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version .
&quot; select the type of character identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms for development . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; using the external application tidy .
&quot; immediate switch between different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries the change can sometimes need time or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the diamond card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ oto ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . with selection of one inser@@ tion , the appropriate sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
displays the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ oto ; main window or out .
&quot; the changes in this dialog affects any application that use the K@@ HTML @-@ Part , including the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
set the behaviour of the editor . in the documentation of &amp; K@@ ate ; you can find details .
&quot; a dialogue appears in which you can delete entries from the tool@@ box , or which you can add and change the sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should generate an aid according to the environment of the mouse cursor , but is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; a high @-@ quality product is that freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project the developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; development in financial form , find them here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from top to bottom , as for example , after filling the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project is automatically completed . all these path@@ ways and author information fields can later be set with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties are adjusted . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . by entering name , file will be automatically filled . &quot;
&quot; this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ lers . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case and without space with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory . &quot;
&quot; here you can access the server address of the machine , which you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ ex@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; lets you empty this field empty , the default settings of the chosen log will be used . depending on the adjustment of the remote host , an adjustment might be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set rather than the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the tool can be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set rather than the standard . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . it can be selected several files or whole folders .
&quot; this option is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . in ser@@ vers@@ ed Skri@@ ll ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if files , that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , are to be involved . if a project is started from scratch , not an@@ ha@@ ken . &quot;
this option will display all files and folders within the main folder and you can make a precise selection of the voucher .
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the files you want , by removing the tick , remove from the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be up@@ loaded in the menu with project project properties in the sub @-@ window profile or with the keyboard short@@ cut ; F@@ 7 are changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
&quot; a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( Plac@@ eholder is possible ) , which can be re @-@ read in project @-@ related operations such as project folder . &quot;
&quot; additional option to top , even files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the projection screen , which is loaded to the opening of the project , can be read more about proj@@ ections . &quot;
this means that the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed you can find in . the de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ Plugin can be set with the button options . in it is called the de@@ bu@@ gging .
&quot; in the sub@@ window profiles can upload high @-@ load profiles ( see in ) , as well as the display of a super@@ visor for the content of the server for each profile , by drawing up an own building control for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window Team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the sub @-@ window event configuration , you can switch event actions and add these actions to change or delete these actions if a previously specific event occurs , such as the Si@@ akers of a file . see in the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul opens ; the last project that was open . this behavior can not be influenced by now . &quot;
to open another project you choose project open ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
&quot; if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens , the project file will be automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , changed files . same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project man@@ ia gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folders behave as well , however the entries are opening and opening ... within the right mouse @-@ click menu : &quot;
here are different profiles to be chosen . the profile contains information about the location of the up@@ loaded files . see .
&quot; allows the removal of the current profile . if only a profile exists , the button is transfer@@ ed to prevent the removal . &quot;
the password is kept in memory and forget about it . this possibility is useful if common up@@ loading files is needed and the rather in@@ secure password stored on the record does not enter into question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , many high @-@ level profiles can be loaded and therefore the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog will be displayed : &quot;
that is the name of the server to which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified dom@@ a@@ inn@@ ame or IP address function .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; file ( local ) and NFS .
&quot; the port for transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator is not working at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety shaft , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use them according to your discretion . the password is stored on the record so it can not be read easily , but each with programming skills can easily be seen in the plain text . &quot;
&quot; a projection screen is only a set of files and tool@@ making . it can provide many views in a project , i.e. through simple exchange views , various files and tool@@ sets can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; views can be opened or deleted in the menu project or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings tool@@ bar , open or deleted . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , with which you most have to do . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows modification of &amp; agon@@ izing ; on your own way of working . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above , tool can do in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; best to make use of the menu tool@@ bar . use and add @-@ in . adding tool@@ making will be treated in the section &quot; &quot; Add &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar and the symbols on it can be set in either using the context menu ( right @-@ clicking on the tool@@ bar ) , it can set up other actions like tool@@ bar , tool@@ bar can ren@@ ame or tool@@ bar , which can be specified in the dialog , where actions on this or other tool can be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to create an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , you will be able to remove the entries and work action , self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bar and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tool@@ set ... and how settings can be set .. set .
&quot; templates are used in the essential document skel@@ eton , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files . you can copy , move or link any existing directory in the pre @-@ hand tree ; templates have been installed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ oto within about the restrictions you imagine for the fil@@ esystem . &quot;
&quot; some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the terms and conditions presented at the beginning of each template . &quot;
&quot; binary is all that is not pur@@ er text . it can be added any file except text , so pictures , &amp; PDF ; binary templates are usually added in documents using links ( e.g. pictures with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in pre @-@ gym under global templates . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually , new documents can be created for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in appropriate ways to be efficient . some examples may be found under global templates . see for more information about templates . &quot;
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area will always be inserted in the documents . you can find everything from a final note up to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or per@@ l basis . some examples are found in the pre @-@ tree under global templates . see in for more information about templates .
&quot; as its name says , these templates are used for whole websites as templates . they are a collection of various documents which can be organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a comp@@ uted tar archive . at present there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul . &quot;
&quot; design a document structure according to Beli@@ ar ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select file As a template save as a local template .... &quot;
&quot; once that has happened , you notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . take a look at the pre @-@ tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click on file As a template store choice as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily drawn with pulling and dra@@ gging on the construction review templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be used in a template folder . it can be used all file management functions , such as pulling and inser@@ ting or inser@@ ting about the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a folder on the right hand or in the project files , select a name for the template , and secure it . by default , it is possible to store it as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates allow a very target @-@ oriented way of action . you can make head@@ lines and foot@@ ers or dynamic with PHP ; design , paste files or link with them . additionally , you can keep some things in mind when using templates in projects . &quot;
the pre @-@ structure structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stated in $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / share / apps / qu@@ anta / share / apps / qu@@ anta / share / apps / qu@@ anta / share / share / apps / qu@@ anta / share / share / apps / qu@@ anta / share / share / apps / qu@@ anta / share / share / apps / qu@@ anta / share / share / apps / qu@@ anta / share / share / apps / qu@@ anta / share / share / apps / qu@@ anta / share / share / apps / qu@@ anta / share / share / apps / qu@@ anta / share / share / apps / qu@@ anta / share / share / apps / qu@@ anta / share / share / apps / qu@@ anta / share / share / apps / qu@@ anta / share / share / apps / qu@@ anta / share / share / apps / qu@@ anta / share / share / apps / qu@@ anta /
&quot; to specify the behavior of a folder , the right mouse button is right click on the folder and in the context menu properties to choose . the following dialog will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is retri@@ eved as soon as El@@ ter@@ ous attributes is dro@@ wn . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits all except the regul@@ ators in the board @-@ view . if a regul@@ ator would be adjusted so it would be explicitly activated in this path , unless it would be explicitly activated in this path . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text tree . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a regular folder . &quot;
&quot; allows modification or set text for templates in this folder , which could be general Head@@ lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project and allows you to equi@@ p a folder with special Head@@ lines / foot@@ er lines all the presentation already with the appropriate Head@@ lines / foot@@ er lines . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you have a text @-@ menu ( on that point , right mouse button ) via a complete command @-@ link collection for adding the folders or copy and paste from templates from one place to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor , which are accessible via the menu View . the first mode replaces the code text editor in two parts : the code text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : he invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML . then you can edit and switch if necessary to source code editor in which the changes performed in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
&quot; in working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document , which contains a small green symbol the V@@ oh@@ and@@ rop@@ es &amp; PHP ; -@@ source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor . to edit &amp; PHP , there is still no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first one , except that simultaneously the changes in the source code as well as in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor are visible in the code text editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor are already active , the keyboard switches the active cursor from a window to the other , whereby the position is maintained in the document . &quot;
the synchron@@ ization balance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the code text editor can be set up via settings Qu@@ anta ... After choosing V@@ PL ; view you can automatically set between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . in principle the recommendation can be adjusted in addition . generally the recommendation is : a small span@@ ne for fast calcul@@ ator and a large Span@@ ne for slow .
&quot; suppose you want to change the title of the website , so the documentation of the documentation is created . thus , the documentation of invisible tags in working with the V@@ PL ; editor will also be called , as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . this is used to reduce the suspension of the text . thus , you can change the following : &quot;
met@@ a @-@ tags permit the storage of information about the document themselves e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . one click into the list allows modification of the password names and key@@ word key wor@@ t@@ 2 on the content column .
CSS @-@ rules are the new way of designing the sight of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . editing via the list is exactly as possible with the met@@ a elements . the editing of CSS @-@ rules is currently not supported .
&quot; it is possible to bind an external CSS @-@ style type , by pressing on the file button , and select the appropriate file . &quot;
&quot; the use of the C@@ si is like in a text processing , due to the arrows , possible . in rare circumstances the cursor works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and by means of resi@@ dual or removal taste . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags are made in the same way via the tool@@ bar , as in the code text editor . it is to note that inser@@ ting tags before already existing identical tags are not removed , e.g. if an anchor day , each other surrounding anchor has to be removed . &quot;
&quot; some tool projects such as the tables assistant or lists of lists are disabled . you will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; they will be used later in &amp; V@@ PL , in this release , the tables or lists tool@@ box must be used . &quot;
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the investigation of styles . in contrast to other programs for style deposits the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of a style template can be followed .
&quot; to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , need except &amp; k@@ de ; nor library li@@ b@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ bex@@ s@@ lt and li@@ b@@ x@@ ml , which are available at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already available . &quot;
content in a template that is placed in a position in one of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g @-@ packed style or x@@ ml file or the current k@@ not . new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in the g@@ db compatibility mode can be set in a specified file and poin@@ ter number and later be activated .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the complete path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without a deposit . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the top @-@ loaded style file with rel@@ ativ@@ ly path to the App@@ en@@ ame con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is loaded for example a style file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is possible to enter :
in this command is checked for a partial or entire agreement with a purpose named QNA@@ ME or a specified mod@@ us@@ en@@ ame . &amp; eg . template agrees with each of the QNA@@ ME that contains the string template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP ME &quot; is added according to the rules that have been defined by the nam@@ esp@@ x@@ s@@ l : tested 1 &amp; eg ; extended to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : tests 1
a noted brack@@ et must be dissolved for the associated UR@@ I and poin@@ t@@ number . this is automatically performed when charging the first template through x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . half @-@ points are re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each run .

there are many graphic tools for comparisons . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I have written .
&quot; the mer@@ ging was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had been made many changes and at the same time , at the same time , another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts in bringing together . &quot;
&quot; the program used to me only changed the changed lines , but I could not see what changed exactly within these lines . and there was no evidence on the places where you might have changed just the re@@ birth . this change was a small nightmare . &quot;
so that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; b diff@@ 3 could represent differences within a row and changes to white signs . later a lot more useful features were added .
&quot; for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparative window . &quot;
&quot; a function which did a lot of work , was the same and merge from folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser . &quot;
also 3 @-@ way @-@ together is fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently of one piece of co@@ de and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously indicates the expected result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the scre@@ enshot shows three Qu@@ ell files in combination :
&amp; R@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with the same and merge complete folder . this scre@@ enshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder :
&quot; &amp; diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences in and serve them to monitors the possibilities today . if you have often to verify co@@ de , you will like this feature . &quot;
&quot; differences in white signs and t@@ abl@@ ers are shown clearly . if lines differ only in a certain number of white signs , one can see that at a glance at the bottom of the column at the left side . ( no trouble more , if someone changes the reverse . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other differs in a line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different . &quot;
&quot; if all files are equal to the same name , but in different folders , you can ease the typ@@ ing work by simply writing the file name of the first file . example : &quot;
diff@@ use 3 Ord@@ inary 2 tr@@ acked 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 -@@ o target folder k@@ diff@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Tri@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ inary 3 -@@ o target sub@@ folders
&quot; opening dialog makes the manual type of fil@@ en@@ ame , selection on the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the list . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file for the next time ; if you leave the file entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be executed . &quot;
&quot; in the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the same or merge from folders , for B and C , however , uses a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ames from A to the other folders . &quot;
&quot; when assembled , the input field is active for the goal and can be dealt with . however , it is not necessarily necessary to establish a output file . you can also do this step later when saving . &quot;
the inser@@ ting button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start with the same / match .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; Pro@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to choose text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in opening dialog you need to select no files , you can simply close the dialog with the breaking button . &quot;
you can also use dra@@ gging and insert : just drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it drop him via a comparison window .
&quot; which idea is behind it ? sometimes , a file contains a number of similar functions . if you want to find out how much these functions are , it would be a relatively great effort . you would have to just download two appropriate files , put them in &amp; diff@@ use@@ 3 ; now you can copy the relevant sections simply , paste and then compare . &quot;
note : currently you can pull out anything out &amp; bl@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the case drop of text into a comparison window will be supported .
warning : some editors interpret the pulling and dra@@ fting text into another program than cutting and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; in the upper part of each text window is the info line . the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the drawing number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C ) has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , the mouse can rest for a while . ) , a small auxiliary window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows have the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these preferences can be changed through the settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is detected , one sees the color that is different . if both files differ , the default color is different . ( color for conflicts in settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( together ) . &quot;
&quot; links next to the text is the listing column . if differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages , the color is not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + for example , there are white signs only in strings and comments , relevant for pre@@ tension and in a few , rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which separates the connection column from the text , is interrupted on the points where the respective source file has no lines . if the number of code is activated , the line to broken lines is displayed . &quot;
&quot; the results window ( among the comparison window ) also has an Info @-@ line with the ins@@ cription output : the file name , and &#91; changes &#93; , when you have the result , already contains text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are dis@@ b@@ anded is saving disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to find a stem and un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two compar@@ ators are used , each difference at the same time is also a conflict which needs to be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the one belonging to the row is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will appear . ) This group will then be highlighted the current group . it is highlighted with the color wall@@ paint for current area and each on the left appears a black beams . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , through the automatic merge or by manual Edit no further line will be left in the group ; one line is displayed in the file ; no line is displayed in the file ; this text appears neither in the final saved file , nor in a mark@@ er that you may copy and paste elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; file @-@ based conflicts , however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board when you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this feature . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting sources select the options , ignore or ignore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ates mainly with the image drives and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are used in one of the windows , you can use the arrows left , right , down , page , end , string start and tr@@ ump end can also be used by clicking it as well as to navigate . &quot;
&quot; in the eye window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the inser@@ ting button you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ load mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode . ) &quot;
one click with the left mouse button on one of the summar@@ ies @-@ columns displaying the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the section and explained the edi@@ table window ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( str@@ g @-@ picture downhill / str@@ g @-@ image ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict . therefore , all these are not automatically sol@@ dered conflicts also after the manual . therefore , between dissolved and un@@ resolved conflicts must be distinguished . &quot;
&quot; to copy the mark@@ er into the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the copying button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or str@@ g inser@@ ting ) . if this option is enabled , whatever you want to copy right into the cli@@ p@@ board and copy the manual copy . be careful with this option but carefully re@@ write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board accidentally . &quot;
&quot; po@@ inters are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix @-@ based systems use a poin@@ ter sign \ , and Win@@ 32 @-@ based systems use the default file files \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 keeps the display of the source files . therefore , you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using binary files . &quot;
the options and the list of last used files will be automatically saved in the building and restored during the next start . ( menu Sett@@ ings@@ - &gt; K@@ de@@ 3 set up ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog will also use scripts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; when you activate this option , differences are displayed in short @-@ sive scrip@@ ture . if the selected script does not support this display , does not happen at all . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rec@@ ast@@ ed . on these systems , the button pre@@ settings automatically represents an un@@ just color . &quot;
&quot; when this option is activated , the corresponding number of blank spaces are inserted in the pressures of the tab@@ s button . otherwise , a t@@ ator sign is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you input or return , the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is activated , each selection is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual copy to the cli@@ p@@ board then falls . &quot;
&quot; you can select which type @-@ type type you prefer to store , the default value is the usual usual choice on the operating system . &quot;
&quot; in the comparisons of files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step you can ignore white signs . in this step , white signs are not ignored . in this step , white signs will not be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a wagon line &apos; \ \ &apos; and a poin@@ ter &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others can only save a poin@@ ter sign , but then it could be different . if this option is activated , this option must be de@@ activated . in default , this option is de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis , figures and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored , but they are treated like white signs . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , this option is de@@ activated . changes in comments will be treated as changes in white signs . &quot;
&quot; intensive search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in the Autom@@ atically St@@ opping mode , this attitude determines how long the outcome of the selection will be shown before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; sol@@ ves automatic all conflicts in white signs by using the selected file as a source . ( default , manual selection . ) This is useful when white signs are less important in many files , then use better the features of voting A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts in numbers or comments , if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments . &quot;
these options are treated in the chapter to scan and perform a compilation . look for details under documentation on the folder comparison and merger .
&quot; if a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version is attached to the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such a b@@ aking file exists with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without any further backup . &quot;
&quot; change the interface of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you need to end and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is set in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is globally set above the control centre . ) &quot;
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option will be used for all entries the upper setting .
about the selection fields for the co@@ ding appears a short notice which is the local co@@ ding . ( this can not be changed here and has a purely informal character . )
customize the file enco@@ ding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted as enco@@ ding for each file separately can be compared and merged with different co@@ ding .
&quot; if you edit a file , you can specify which enco@@ ding should be used for storing . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre@@ fabri@@ cation command , they could possibly not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code ) but the pre@@ fabri@@ cation command can only be set with 8 @-@ bit AS@@ C@@ II . ) With this option you can use the enco@@ ding of pre @-@ processing commands . &quot;
&quot; turn this off to press the high@@ s of changes in white characters in the text or review split . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments . ) &quot;
&quot; this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a colored excess column . but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files . after selection from A &amp; lt ; B , A &amp; B ; -@@ l ; C is displayed beside the normal yet another survi@@ vor column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you want to use the available space on screen rather for long lines . blend you simply the less important windows . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
orders the comparison window next to each other . this can also be useful for viewing long lines . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes , consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click starts the compilation and use the file name of the previous source file as the default file for the output file . ( if this function is used to launch the file , then the name of the last source file will be maintained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file it is transferred to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use this feature for example to cut out disturbing parts or to correct the inser@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file it is given first to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command is specified first ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only by default . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that is exactly your requirements . each input line must have an associated issue . &quot;
&quot; the thought behind it is to allow the user more flexibility in adju@@ sting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program that self . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient . &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command to convert them into big letters : sed &apos;s / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ . * \ \ \ \ \ \ \ . \ \ \ \ \ \ \ . \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in upper case letters .
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to add automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / key@@ word substitution ) . * \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ header _ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and maybe you like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the Ign@@ ore of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further sub@@ processing command for hands @-@ right . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so quasi deleted . &quot;
sometimes you might want to perform several compositions at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use to separate the compositions apart . example :
instead sed you can also use something else like e.g. per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / switch &apos; aller@@ dings are different with per@@ l a few details differently . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires per@@ l only ( and ) without the included &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
&quot; the data after the normal ser@@ ver@@ essor are maintained for viewing and together . further operations only change the data , which sees the hands @-@ off @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m . &quot;
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal ser@@ ver@@ essor , the default comparison tells the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the rendering prec@@ ep@@ ts are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or hidden differences , you can not notice specific differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often , programmers need to edit in a folder a lot of files . for this reason you can compare and merge with &amp; diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively . &quot;
... making a proposal for every object ; you can adjust the suggestion before the start
... can simul@@ ate this together and shows the simul@@ ated changes without being really carrying out
&quot; perform selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
&quot; this is very similar to comparisons , and merge from individual files very similar . you just need to enter a folder on the command line or in the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; when three folders are merged , then the folder 1 is used as the base . if no goal folder was specified , uses &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; folder 3 as target @-@ folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not merge the system together , you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 button . ( more details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder you will inform a small news window about the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folder , only the files are listed until then . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder , displays &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ... &quot;
&quot; each file and a folder that was found during the scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click . &quot;
the folder structure is usually folded . you can click a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object double or by clicking the arrows for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions All sub@@ directories and all sub@@ directories that you can apply to all folders or folders .
&quot; if you double click on a file , the file will be started and it will appear a comparison window . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , then this can be automatically selected in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the contrac@@ tion action can not be automatically chosen . if that run together , you will be informed about problems of this kind . &quot;
&quot; to be seen in the above picture , are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow , and black . &quot;
&quot; however , with identical entries , the color is also identical , although the age of the entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folders are considered to be identical if its total content is identical . then also folder the same color . with folders , the age is irrelevant for its color . &quot;
&quot; the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . colours mirror the colors of a leaf again , which is only green , then yellow becomes , then yellow , and later when it is old , is red . &quot;
... &quot; A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if a ) does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. when A file and B is a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , it cannot be launched . &quot;
... A and B do not have the same file types ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the system cannot be launched . &quot;
&quot; the mode to syn@@ cing is active , if only two folders and no explicit targets are specified and if the option directories are active . then , choose &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; the necessary action to adjust to both folder . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; directly after the merge copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; when two folders are merged and the option to select new file instead of inter@@ gam@@ ation ( in@@ secure ) then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different .. If such errors are not removed , the folder can not be launched . &quot;
&quot; while inter@@ connecting one file after the other one is working . it &apos;s status column shows one , if the results performed together , you should make a last review and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; when in the interior dialog chosen the file method full @-@ continuous analysis , K@@ diff@@ 3 further columns will display . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , detached , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for dissolved conflicts will only be displayed when three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you may either merge the just selected item ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or have all entries at once . if you have selected all assemb@@ ling actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can launch that . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have not specified a target folder , then in three @-@ folder mode C is used as the target , in the two folder folder , B will be chosen as the destination and is used when du@@ b@@ bing A and / or B as target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a target folder , please check whether all entries should be in the target folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options to be covered by certain entries . check these options to avoid un@@ ad@@ orable surprises : &quot;
to add all entries : choose fil@@ esystem / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut short@@ cut ) to only select the current item or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if due to conflic@@ ting file types , actions will still exist , a message appears on the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge any entries , a dialog window appears with the options play@@ through , simul@@ ate and break down . &quot;
&quot; choose Sim@@ ulation If you want to see only what would happen without the really changes , you will receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Si@@ diff@@ 3 ; then leads certain actions with all orders . if a manual intervention is needed ( merge to a single file ) , then a composite window will pop up ( note the scre@@ enshot ) . &quot;
&quot; when you are finished with a file , select again fil@@ esystem / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you do not have saved a corresponding dialog , then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next entry continue . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list you &apos;ll see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem . so you have the option to select another action for the entry or to solve the problem in a different way before proceeding with the problem . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been together individually , &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) , and performs at the later entries all entries are not recorded again . even if you have assembled the entries , these entries are considered to be done . only if you change the one action , these entries will be staged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ de@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called directory @-@ merger with these options :
only files that fit on the specified pattern are displayed in the sub@@ tree . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; there are several patterns to be entered . valid for example * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folder must not match this pattern .
files and folders containing the pattern are not displayed in the sub@@ tree ; it can be entered more than a pattern ; use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid Plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders containing the pattern are not displayed in the sub@@ tree ; it can be entered more than a pattern ; use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid Plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder can be set up with a .@@ c@@ v@@ signal file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a put @-@ attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a g@@ ain@@ ted point indicates a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the sub@@ tree or not . this option is switched on the default . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links will display . this is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; when left on a folder : if the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the links will be treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively checked out . a link to a folder that would lead to a final loop and &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; cras@@ hing . ) This option is activated in default . &quot;
&quot; introduces a complete analysis of each file and displays statistics columns . ( the number of detached , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflict . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower if applied to files that contain no text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern ) . &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folder over a slow network , it may possibly be quicker , only the chan@@ gel@@ ding date and the file size . however , this speed is a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is switched on the default . &quot;
similar to the managing date . no real comparison takes place . the files are considered to be identical if when copying the chan@@ gel@@ ding date has been lost . please use caution . this option is switched on the default .
&quot; activ@@ ating the sync mode when two folders are compared and no target @-@ folder was specified . in this mode , the proposals are selected to assemble that followed both folders and files are stored in both folders . this option is off in default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this is considered uncertain , as the knowledge provided that the other file is not changed . ) This option is activated in default . &quot;
&quot; when a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version is ren@@ amed it . if an old backup file already exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension it will also affect the normal composite file . this option is switched on the default file . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder ing@@ merge inside the merge single files visible ; you can switch the window list with the mouse . if you do not want to switch the window list &amp; text window , divide the window list , and switch between the list &amp; text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file using a double @-@ click . however , there is also an appropriate menu entry into the folder . once you save the result , the status will be done directly , and the file will not again be combined once you launch the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status will be lost if you read the directory again : list -@@ menu : read again &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE supports networking with the help of K@@ IO @-@ slaves . K@@ de@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open , which are on local or remote machines . &quot;
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a comp@@ lied archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things should be considered :
&quot; a path can be relatively und@@ o . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be masks . ( # - &gt; % 23 , - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ ill@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol , it follows a short list of restrictions : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link indicates a file or folder , then it is always assumed a file as a link destination . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or the change date from the original . ( note the option confidential of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files ) . &quot;
&quot; the main purpose of use is currently used as the differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op first always starts in the built @-@ in differences . in order to launch K@@ de@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In K@@ de@@ 3@@ Part display in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; usually , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is applied to the input file , it takes a patch file in the Uni@@ fied format . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch includes the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the con@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the text@@ menu preview in - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . besides , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since generating the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part performed , it supports only the same of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . the merge or the same by folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now He@@ is it comp@@ are ) already there . in addition , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can perform together like the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff @-@ Tool collection . &quot;
I have been using GPL @-@ programs for a very long time and have learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have walked this path or get him so .
&quot; you can compile the program from sources and the configure script will probably not be the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default installed configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can not find resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white signs is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white sign is different , the line will be treated as not identical . if , if , if next to each other , this cl@@ i will be compared to the case of the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor remembers every difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file , and it is a lot of effort to design extra of its own file format that could store this information . &quot;
the effort to do so far has been too big . you can restore a certain version over the selection of a source A / B / C . to edit a larger quantities of text should be used by another editor .
&quot; after removing text is suddenly lt , no sr@@ c gets , and the text cannot be removed . what does that mean and how can this be removed ? &quot;
&quot; &amp; Si@@ diff@@ 3 , already uses many colors to distinguish between differences . even more high@@ lighting would be confusing and is missing the purpose . please use another editor . &quot;
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of last changes can be found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; to compile &amp; install 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system , installed in the K@@ DE . if you are uns@@ afe , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; there &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ akers used , you should not have any problems during comp@@ iling . however , difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of it . &quot;
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ removal ) copies in the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the marked text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ In@@ sert ) adds the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current curve @-@ position or replaces the current marking .
&quot; only differences display : files that are identical in all folders does not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the target folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you must re@@ configure the folder after changes to these options ( &quot; &quot; Re@@ fresh &quot; &quot; folder . ) &quot;
&quot; there are only entries displayed , the differences do . that also does not contain identical files in the same folder . if the target file does not contain these files , they are missing after the folder . ( the behaviour will not be amended in later program version ) . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to select the source containing let@@ tering A , B and C beneath the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are attached from the corresponding window to the end of the selected group in the results window ( if the lines are already present ) , they will be removed with clicking the button accordingly . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , this option is de@@ activated . under@@ differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white signs . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a thumb@@ show of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the current programs on the space surfaces to change their size , stop or shift it . this works both inside a desktop and at several . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . the applications can be selected and can even be moved on the desktop and to others .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved inside &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other workplaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on : if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; clicked , the context menu has only replaced the two entries p@@ ager ... and end . if however , on an application inside &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ pped , the context menu also appears as well as the name of the application as well as the entries to minim@@ ise , maxim@@ izing , on working surface and end . the commands provide the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izing the application window on the full size of the desktop . appears only if applied to an application .
send the application to the selected virtual desktop . appears only if applied to an application .
&quot; this tick @-@ box is marked , you can move windows within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other desktop surfaces . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager are shown ; the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are shown . &quot;
&quot; rout@@ ing this field lets the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops ; it is together with name displayed , the names are provided with folders , &amp; eg . 1 . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also shown as a background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the current programs will be displayed as small windows at the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty work@@ space will be displayed to make their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simple shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . symbol shows the windows with its standard symbol and pixel map showing a small view of the real program window . note : pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager should be determined : classi@@ cally , &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n R@@ aster , all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are known in some other Windo@@ w@@ ders ; wa@@ its shows all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal range , which is very good for displaying lateral on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini @-@ program in the Control Panel . it has the advantage that it can display in size , displaying the window as symbols or with its content and move . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
right click within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and then select the switch switches ... lets the dialog settings appear .
&quot; at the moment , this cannot be changed in the dialog Settings . however , you can manually do it manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ ag@@ err@@ c with any text editor , like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or V@@ I. If you don &apos;t have to register as user root or sign up for your system administrator . in this file you must register the key win@@ do@@ w@@ Transpar@@ ent mode and assign a value to this . possible values are : &quot;
&quot; because &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package base , you need a functioning installation of the K@@ DE basic pack@@ ets . &quot;

&quot; there is a screen lu@@ pe . you can enlarge with &amp; k@@ likes ; a part of the screen allows you to use a magni@@ fier for the folding or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is intended for various users : this includes artists , web designers and people with a visual impairment . this documentation is intended to be a complete guide for the use of &amp; cat . &quot;
&quot; it may be a powerful application , which is constantly expanding to new functions . it is optimized for use on weak computers . &quot;
&quot; if you like &amp; b ; start a window as shown above . the main window of the screen shows the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window appears as magni@@ fying window .. The image which is shown in enlar@@ ging window , is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as the selection window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , enlarged &amp; k@@ likes ; the area around the mouse @-@ cursor like a movable tail . alternatively , you can present &amp; k@@ b ; to make a selected screen area in magni@@ fying window ( drop @-@ in mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse cursor at the side of the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse @-@ cursor in the enlarged windows are shown , select the mouse cursor in the enlarged window . this is not yet able to detect the shape of the mouse cursor . this is always the default file ; / Q@@ t ; mouse cursor . &quot;
&quot; in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse keys and change its size . this can be done in the following manner : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse cursor into the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button down , so you can fly and move the content of the magni@@ fier window . this also goes with the arrow buttons . &quot;
&quot; if you additionally press the &amp; Shift ; taste , or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper @-@ left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is moving . &quot;
&quot; it has a lot of features . you can send the larger image directly to the printer , copy them into a file , copy it into other applications ( to add it later into other applications ) , turning the image and much more . &quot;
&quot; start or stops the update of the display . the monitor of the update brings , that the required CPU time is against 0 . &quot;
&quot; choose the updating rate ( Very low , low , means , high , very high ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;

&quot; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse cursor is scrat@@ ched on the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer the R@@ SI syndrome ( repeti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ ine syndrome ) and those of each mouse @-@ click pains . &quot;
&quot; cu@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse cursor is scrat@@ ched on the same place . it is meant to help people who em@@ ulate the repeti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and those of each mouse @-@ click pain . besides , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . this requires little practice . &quot;
&quot; ti@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; can handle the pain that comes with clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without ache . unfortunately , you can also find pain associated with the use of your computer , if you need a doctor , if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to clarify it again : even though &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; pain helps to prevent sor@@ ting with the mouse , it is against pain caused by the causes of the mouse , useless . and as with all the ergonomic arm@@ aments , the result may vary for everyone . &quot;
&quot; the use of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; monitored your mouse movements , and guides a mouse click , once you break the movement shortly . &quot;
&quot; if the intelligent moving is activated , makes &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; take a break after it has done the pressing of the mouse . in this way you can run the pulling of mouse button . in this way you can drag the pulling off mouse button . this smart move requires a little practice , but you get used rapidly to it . &quot;
this type of denial must be mu@@ til@@ ted after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; a single mouse click away .
&quot; intelligent shifting turns on , the turn@@ around is switched off ( 1 / 10 s ) . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; after downloading the mouse button wa@@ its before it is broken back , if no sign of the mouse is done . &quot;
&quot; sil@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; supports now the click through mouse @-@ postpon@@ ement . if this function is activated , a slow due to right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow due to the left and back then leads a double @-@ click . these movements are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / c@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; the first time is started , but can later be changed . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is delayed , you can move &amp; k@@ de ; to move the reaction time ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select there sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der sound bu@@ ffer to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; launched at every start of &amp; k@@ de ; this feature is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please make sure to find out how to start a program there . &quot;
&quot; sets all settings back to the values that were set in opening the dialog . have you already pushed the button down , the settings will be reset to the state after the last push . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; first of all with preference . especially the intelligent shifting should let you first stop off . if you then click on the automatic mouse click , you can later continue the intelligent moving . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the answer times of &amp; k@@ de ; at sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click without impact remains : the clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in your browser window , which does not represent a link , does not lead to un@@ resolved reactions . you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse prints , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you clean not just the mouse ball , but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , from mouse to mouse differently . it should be clear however , if you view the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you need to see the roles . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and the pol@@ lu@@ tions can be easily made with a flat blade or the nails . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations the operating system breaks out the execution of &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; if you use it in this case the intelligent moving pool , this means that &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; surgery can no longer stop by letting the mouse stop . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; use a different window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution to this problem is that you yourself perform a mouse click . here , the status of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ pool is reset , and you can work as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , tries &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and put the cursor to another point . &quot;
&quot; solution : use mouse to place the cursor to place where you want to have it . however , you can easily retrieve the mouse on a neutral section of the desktop . you can &apos;t get out of the mouse over a neutral mouse clicks . so the gray areas for the tool@@ bar and menus and the title @-@ lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent shifting , but I don &apos;t make it to edit text . &quot;
&quot; intelligent shifting is an advanced feature of &amp; mou@@ ths tool , and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely to highlight text to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and to re @-@ insert it in the cli@@ p@@ board . however , some advice will probably be prepared for you . here are some advice : &quot;
&quot; use the intelligent order not , if you just want to start using &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool . simply highlight text instead , execute the mouse button down , while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text and click the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; using the audi@@ ble mouse click . thus , each time , if &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; the mouse button pus@@ hes a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when you move the moving time . later you can use the intelligent shifting even without the audi@@ ble mouse @-@ click . however , it requires some practice . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; use to be installed , the X@@ test @-@ extension for &amp; X Win@@ dow ; that should be the case on most system . &quot;
the functionality of the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ able mouse clicks is available only if the system has a sound card and loud@@ speakers and it is correct .
&quot; mouse @-@ mou@@ set@@ tes , pressing the mouse button as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor is shortly bent . this program was developed for people who suffer the R@@ SI syndrome and where the actu@@ ation of the cho@@ osed pain is being prepared . &quot;
&quot; pu@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting that a pulling process begins , before the mouse is let off . in this way , the pulling and dra@@ fting can be done with the mouse . &quot;

&quot; mouth : is a program , with the mu@@ te user can let their computer speak for themselves . &quot;
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; can allow users to let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the course of conversation , which should be discussed once again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( lin@@ kes scre@@ enshot ) , enter the command one that will later be used for the speech by text . further details can be found in the description of the furniture catalogue . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the default text editor . you can often choose text passages , without having to type them in . the text passages can be processed naturally . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right scre@@ enshot ) you define the dictionary for the wording of the language . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can list the phrase lists with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , so that only proper letter words can be recorded in the vocabulary . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; it is clearly arranged and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your propositions ( the lower white field in the scre@@ enshot ) and a bite @-@ memory of the already spoken phrases ( the upper white field in the scre@@ enshot ) .
&quot; if you have sli@@ pped correctly , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each pronounced set is attached to the storage box . you can select other phrases that are to be discussed again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; setup ... open the entry dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two mapping cards , voice @-@ over@@ s and settings , the page vocabulary and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the map output , enter the command to the call of the voice @-@ generator . in the selection field under the input field , insert the character enco@@ ding , with the text on the language generator will be given . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text on . select the tick @-@ box , if the text is set to be passed on as standard inser@@ tion to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the cross@@ field is not selected , the text is shared as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholder in the following : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation on your language generator . examples for this please refer to the App@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; with as desired as a voice service , &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the further settings on this site are ignored and which currently is developed in SV@@ N . the option of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first sel@@ ector action after selecting a text passage , determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the menu text password or in the bar for text messages . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of so@@ da , the chosen text passage is directly spoken and added in addition to the storage box . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text passage will initially only be entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second drop @-@ up box of the editing pane for text messages , you can specify whether the text editor &apos;s text editor will automatically be stored in the closing of the processing window . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of text enco@@ ders , the book will be saved . if you choose any changes , the text password @-@ book will not be saved . select on schedule to ask , becomes &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text password @-@ book is to be saved . &quot;
the page Wor@@ ter@@ g@@ ation contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the wording of vocabulary . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field when this list contains more than a dictionary . with this comb@@ i you can choose the dictionary currently used for vocabulary .
&quot; with buttons on the right , you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the order of books or export them to a file . beneath the list you can set the name and the language for the dictionary . &quot;
&quot; select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; finally reads the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of each word is determined simply by checking the occurrence . additionally , you can compare the list of words with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , in order to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask then what dic@@ tion@@ aries are led together and how these weights are to be .
&quot; with this option you set a new , empty dictionary with no entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; re @-@ typ@@ ed words automatically into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time . &quot;
the main area of the window to the processing of text @-@ based books is divided . in the upper part the text messages are shown as a tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected item . if you selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated ke@@ ystro@@ kes . if you have selected a text password , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; to add actions like new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books , either via the selection in the menu bar , in tool@@ bar or via a folding menu . &quot;
&quot; the order of text @-@ based books or text passages , you can change through pulling the mouse to the new location or with the arrow keys and the &quot; &quot; arrows &quot; &quot; key . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is cut and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text @-@ cut is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the cycle of connection . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text @-@ cut is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the cycle @-@ storage . &quot;
&quot; the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected propositions of the contract @-@ storage . &quot;
&quot; if this menu item is crossed , a postpon@@ able tool@@ bar is displayed with buttons on the editing window directly under the menu bar . by mou@@ sec@@ lick on the clever left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; if this menu item is crossed , a narrow le@@ bar in the lower part of the main window with references to the condition of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed when not crossed , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu is enabled , a shift list for text passages with entries is displayed . the bar is by default via the editing window directly under the tool@@ bar . by mou@@ sec@@ lick on the clever left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; probably you have the command for the language issue not correctly or not completely entered . open Settings k@@ mouth , set up ... , open the page General settings and enter the command for voice output on the map output . &quot;
&quot; Festival is a language issue of the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh is supported . the license allows it to use festival for free and without any restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice issue , it is assumed that festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival . the command to voice output is then : &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is a Java language generator . currently he only supports the English pron@@ unciation . currently he only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without any restrictions .
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the language issue , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et@@ ts . the language issue is possible with one of the three following commands : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option has to be switched on as default output . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ em@@ emen into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ery , so you need an additional program to use the text in phon@@ eme . the license allows it to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; for example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to transform the German text into phon@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax will@@ ingly like to add the final sign of the text , so that an additional character must be added . the full command is therefore elaborate as in the other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / usr RO@@ LA / de@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ e / usr RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in a single line . the option data must be switched as default .
&quot; the VO @-@ dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ continued language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications is currently developing a standard interfaces for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice @-@ over@@ s systems . &quot;
&quot; since the setting of the voice @-@ generator is only done at the TT@@ SD , you only need to use as kt@@ ts@@ d as a voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; to choose the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which will be installed in the entry dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to take advantage of you , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ mouth ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on the individual of your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; mouth : is an application , with the people who cannot speak to let text present through the computer . a list of already pro@@ cu@@ le sets is stored , which the user can constantly leave again . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; does not include language courses . on the machine you have to be installed a language entry .

&quot; when the first start of k@@ nights or as long as no speakers are established , the car@@ tei@@ card speakers will be displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the car@@ tei@@ card gener@@ als will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different males or female , or those who stand up in volume or speed . you can also use several variants for a synthes@@ izer . you should at least use a speaker , before you &amp; kt@@ ine ; use since the program speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise used the standard speaker . &quot;
different spokes@@ man for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to multiple printing presses for the same printer .
if you click on the picture postcard speaker in k@@ nights &quot; k@@ nights &quot; the car@@ tei@@ card speaker is displayed . it will appear automatically when you start k@@ nights and have no speaker set up .
all already designed speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear above in the list . the top speakers will be used for voice output when an application is no speaker .
&quot; with a mouse @-@ click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; click with a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse @-@ click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to slide the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of speakers in the list is also given their priority . &quot;
click on any of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; t@@ ect@@ - system .
&quot; select a voting type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boy and maid &apos;s vote to choose from . &quot;
&quot; click here , if you click here , the new speaker appears on the map speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;

&quot; K@@ not@@ fy is the message system of &amp; k@@ de , which you can notify about from you . you can read the text of these messages also from t@@ ect@@ ory ; to read . &quot;
&quot; in conversation , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set different types of messages . you can notify you of different kinds of messages , for example set up a message where your nickname occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ops ; you can then read the IR@@ C news . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ not@@ fy , appears a menu item noti@@ fications in the Settings menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ not@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; filter for string composition provide a good possibility in &amp; kt@@ ops ; it is a good example . it is a good example . you removes the tags br and b from the news , the K@@ mail sends , and also the expression / local / In@@ box as this can be accepted in most cases as provided . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of t@@ ect@@ ory ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ops ; filters are not required .
&quot; in filtr@@ ators text is processed , before it is sent to the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for enhancing the pron@@ unciation , to select false words or abbrevi@@ ations to select a suitable language and speaker or to deal with certain lack of language courses and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ops ; sets four kinds of texts . &quot;
the output of Screen Sa@@ a@@ vers has the highest priority . it is pulled up to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read @-@ reader is resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg . processor is becoming more hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after the issue of warning .
&quot; news have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ed normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application to read the news . while you &amp; eg , you can see a long text on a website , you can see with &amp; k@@ mouth ; aler@@ ts are also news . read about this . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text items . each order , which you encounter by the Car@@ part card orders is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text messages . text messages are intended for the issue longer texts , which have no special urgency . &quot;
&quot; all four order species are processed in queue , with the exception of the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application is reading the output of a screen controller , whilst &amp; kt@@ ops ; it is just such a pre @-@ read , this issue will be stopped and finished . &quot;
&quot; first , you must know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Sa@@ a@@ vers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text messages as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News . &quot;
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are made as modules . in the future it may be possible to give further types of filters .
&quot; strings replace parts of a text by other text . the inser@@ ting parts can be delivered either as words or as regular expressions , which allow the set of chat trans@@ cription like : - ) by text or for con@@ form@@ atting of messages from &amp; conversation ; or by mail ; in a better understanding form . &quot;
&amp; XML ; -@@ Trans@@ former use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to a different format . included in the scope of package ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
&quot; with inter@@ viewer / filters , you can send orders depending on the text of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ine . if you have submitted a female voice for example , you can read text from K@@ DE news about it . Si@@ eh@@ . read more about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied to voice output . if the filter determines that its rules does not apply , the text remains unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; D ; mail alert is sent by all the activated filters , which have been set up on the page down . the filters are processed in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of fully functional filters . if a filter is not crossed , it is not activated and will not be used . filters are processed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will display the further listed below . &quot;
&quot; for setting up strings , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . then these patterns are exchanged in the text , then the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text . large @-@ scale and lo@@ graphy is not observed when compared . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it just has to distinguish itself from the name of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in column match and replaces it in accordance with the string string in column . the list is processed in the sequence from top to bottom .
click here to move the marked word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can download a list of words or regular expressions from a file to save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries from the file will be app@@ ended to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language included , the filter is only applied , if the speaker speaks for the text contract one of the languages listed here . you can also select multiple languages if you click on the mouse button , click the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is only used when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
the application ID of course programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers need to we@@ ave . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID sold @-@ 34@@ 32 is allowed to enter only copies .
&quot; the string composition filter is applied only to the text when all conditions are applied with an entry in the box &quot; &quot; filter &quot; &quot; when you match . are all input fields blank , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when compared to words , the strings filters are used regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must be restricted by divi@@ ders ( spaces ) . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you can find no instructions for writing regular expressions . however , if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; schedule installed , you can call it in the di@@ alogs to add or Edit as help for assemb@@ ling these expressions . read the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; prints can be found in the package . &quot;
&quot; &amp; XML ; trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from a format into a different format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such transformations . however , the auxiliary program x@@ t@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system . &quot;
enter the path for the program x@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ t@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the ambient variable path also reaches x@@ t@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; with the spokes@@ person you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is designed to the car@@ tei@@ d speaker , or to a speaker with certain characteristics . you can specify , for example , that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ine ; there is a text written to the filter , there is a spokes@@ man for the text . the speaker is chosen by the speaker properties , which sends the program , and sends the characteristics of the present@@ er speakers . with the spokes@@ person speaker , you can write the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is applied , if the text contains the bearing regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; phrases installed , you can access this with a click on the button to get help with the input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression in the beginning of the string , i.e. , begin the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; &quot;
&quot; click here the properties of the desired speech conditions . if the text meets the conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to indicate the desired requirements . click on the button on the right to view the dialogue speaker . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your spre@@ aders or delete all settings .
&quot; the speaker de@@ filter is applied only to the text , if all conditions apply to an entry in the box of this filter when applicable . you have to enter at least one condition . &quot;
&quot; the VO API , of &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmers can lend their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; D@@ Bus ; &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with language extensions to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; kt@@ ops ; this synthes@@ izer can use . &quot;
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the VO API of &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice files about the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ port of &amp; k@@ de ; from the t@@ kt@@ id about the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; here is text of the text for reading and option a language code like &amp; eg , en , de &amp; etc . &quot;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands
&quot; open two &amp; console ; window . start a kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then box @-@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the named language traction supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML , XML ; trans@@ former@@ filter , but when using the module for festival pages will not be read . &quot;
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you have to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able at all works . you also need to do that if you do not use this voice to read Web pages . make sure that the program x@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the ambient variable path .
&quot; certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation appear to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sentences is issued or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first of all , make sure the option string is set to the right value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain signs or words , these may be fixed by a string based filter . see . &quot;

&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE code archive , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ine ; from it you can find the source code below ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / . &quot;
includes many languages . a list of all supported languages can be found on the project &apos;s htt@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
&quot; American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Polish , Polish , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and &quot;
K@@ T@@ TS also works with each language school which can be started at the command line in one &amp; console ;
&quot; the list of the above languages can be incomplete or outdated . therefore , draw the description of the synthes@@ izer into the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ops ; , according to information , which are not included in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the program &quot; &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; uses a customiz@@ able module @-@ architecture for voice plug . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ops ; for the use of another synthes@@ iz@@ ers , contact the development team . &quot;
the program x@@ t@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for supporting SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian user can install x@@ t@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; to compile &amp; kt@@ ops ; to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( Version 3.4 or newer ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the Desig@@ ners files for the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source texts from the source archive or downloaded from the source archive or downloaded from the source archive , you have downloaded and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ am ; use first , be sure if speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your language entry . for this , you can use the sh@@ ell@@ ent SPD @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ de ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.@@ 4 , the first version of t@@ kt@@ at@@ cher is used ; the program k@@ ern@@ ms@@ gr is supposed to be developed so further that the establishment of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is broken down into individual phrases . the user can with@@ stand pro@@ posi@@ tional or det@@ ects , repeat the issue or break down . &quot;
&quot; if a application gives text to &amp; kt@@ ops , it can request the properties of the favorite speaker for the output . so if you have created a speaker , whose language is English and its gender is feminine , otherwise it is automatically chosen to choose the best speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ops ; a speaker chooses to see you in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the Kar@@ le@@ Card speaker at addition , and to add a speaker to the list or click on Edit , the car@@ tei@@ card speakers will be displayed . as an example , the module &apos;s setup for Festival Interactive is shown below . details on the modules can be found under . &quot;
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is contained in path you just have to enter a festival .
&quot; select the code enco@@ ding for text which is handed over at the festival . in general , this setting is made automatically . generally speaking , Western languages are using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , eastern languages like Czech or Slov@@ ak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders , you set volume , intercom speed , and pitch @-@ height of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some controller and appear this grey , the voice you selected will not be able to do these settings . &quot;
&quot; some votes such as Multi@@ sy@@ n &apos;s votes will need to be loaded in a number of seconds because of their size . if you mark this landing stage , these voices are already loaded using K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( for large storage consumption ) the first set will be syn@@ ced faster . &quot;
&quot; if this tick @-@ box is not selected , you still have no speaker set up ( or do not forget to apply ) . &quot;
&quot; this tick @-@ box is marked with the start of k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr , the program window is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this tick @-@ box is marked and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr is not running , it appears in the system area , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text , so you have the possibility to read or otherwise control it . &quot;
&quot; here are all the assignments performed in the queue , along with the application , which has set the job , the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the straight set sentence . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the map speaker . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can find sat@@ an on the order that is selected in the list below , or go back . ( but not every job consists of several sets ) . &quot;
by clicking on OK all changes in the settings ( also on the other diamond cards ) are taken and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr is res@@ ized to the symbol in the system section . then click on this symbol to re @-@ display the program window .
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead Al@@ sa , G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the Good tab Audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here only text contracts are performed and managed . issues of Screen Sa@@ a@@ vers , warnings and messages are not shown . further information on the communication types of &amp; kt@@ ops ; find in . &quot;
&quot; here , select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , has been compiled as a component ; either without support for the appropriate audi@@ om@@ o@@ Du@@ l , or &amp; kt@@ ine ; it cannot load necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de should be used for the audio output , select here the audio output . if no output modules are shown in the list , you need to install at least one module . have you selected Al@@ sa , select here the PC@@ M device . see also &quot;
&quot; set the intercom rate here . 50@@ th ; % is equivalent to half the half and 200@@ nbsp ; % roughly the double normal intercom speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be installed . &quot;
click on to apply the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; -@@ System .
the list of al@@ sa devices comprises all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to find out which device works with you . in doubt choose standard .
&quot; on this Good tab , you can set up special promotions that will always be executed when the text contract is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ops ; processes four kinds of language orders : &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ vers has the highest priority . it is pulled to all other orders and keeps these orders received . after the output of the screen reader has been read , the requested orders are resum@@ ed . &quot;
al@@ arms have priority to the next @-@ here priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg . processor is becoming hot@@ ly reserved . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
&quot; news have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application to read the news . if you &amp; eg , just read a long text on a website , you can see with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone welcome you just enter the room . &quot;
&quot; if a text contract is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen controller , adds t@@ ect@@ ts ; the audio @-@ over@@ s into the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played , if a normal text contract is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound is active as well as introduc@@ tory message , the introduc@@ tory sound is played in front of the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this Good tab are valid only for normal text messages . for messages , warnings and expenses of Screen Sa@@ a@@ vers , there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to leave with &amp; kt@@ ops ; K@@ not@@ fy @-@ News pre@@ read , start k@@ nights and click noti@@ fications . the Good News aler@@ ts appears . &quot;
&quot; mark this tick @-@ box to turn it off &amp; k@@ de ; this setting is not marked , the remaining settings are disabled and ob@@ t@@ ts ; reads no noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; this attitude is marked , noti@@ fications , in which a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ops ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list or to delete it . if you click on the button add , a dialog will appear in which you want to add the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation , if someone mentioned in an IR@@ C message your nickname . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which in the list is nothing else indicated , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ops . &quot;
use this selection field to set what &amp; kt@@ am ; do if an event meets . you have the following options :
&quot; if you selected user @-@ defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following plac@@ eholder in the following : &quot;
&quot; here you can enter the properties of the desired speaker manufacturer . standard select the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the map speaker speakers as superior entry . see this too . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if a specific application is specified for events , it will be executed . otherwise , the action for all other events of the particular application will be executed . otherwise , the action to carry out is specified under standard ( all other events ) . &quot;
the event All noti@@ fications for application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this you can specify the noti@@ fications of messages as below :
&quot; use the button save to save the settings for noti@@ fications into a file . use the button store to store saved settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click on Dele@@ te . all entries will be deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard includes brands for control of voices , the speaker speed , the volume of volume and pitch . besides the brands for controlling the pron@@ unciation by for example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ops ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you must install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) since this is the default voice which uses the festival in the output of SS@@ ML .
&quot; if the settings for speed or key in the Festival configuration is not set to 100@@ th ; % is set , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ co@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ) &gt; Who has slept in my bed ? asked dad@@ dy Be@@ ar . who has slept in my bed ? asked Mama B@@ är . who has slept in my bed ? asked the b@@ ären@@ kind . &#93; &#93; &gt;
&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filter and pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters ( SD@@ B filter ) . thus , SB@@ Ds are able to read more quickly , not the whole text order . thus , you can also stop or stop on the whole text message . thus , you can also stop or stop back and break , even if the langu@@ ders are not directly supported . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filters . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ops , it is automatically set up as an indication of a pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filter . you can add their settings or add other pro@@ posi@@ tional filters , but at the beginning of it will fail . &quot;
&quot; in the easiest way to learn the setup of the speaker selection by trying out . turn on the selection panel orders , which speaker &amp; kt@@ ops . select the speaker selection again , change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker is changed . of course you have to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; then faster with reading can be started , as only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can take very long , &quot;
&quot; you will then be able to stop or break with text contracts , even if language traction does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal proposition filter filter is automatically set up when you start k@@ nights for the first time . it cannot be switched off , just removed . change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
pro@@ posi@@ tional filters compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional character and add a tab ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the pro@@ posi@@ tional sign ( de@@ code characters before the filter are automatically removed from the text ) . note that the standard pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filter are preserved from the text ) .
&quot; SB@@ D filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed from default the normal proposition filter filter , you can insert this once again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file . &quot;
on the diamond card inter@@ phone selection you can over@@ write the Spe@@ akers for the application . the car@@ tei@@ card is displayed when
usage of the standard Spe@@ aker ( the top one on the Kar@@ le@@ chart speaker ) . in other words : no inter@@ viewer features .
&quot; use of the most appropriate speaker , which displays all the properties of a fully equipped speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ops ; for otherwise , select &amp; kt@@ ops ; the speaker chooses , the speaker , which originally meets the original properties . &quot;
select the method for entering the desired intercom properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the properties of the desired intercom . if this property does not play a role , do not give anything . &quot;
highlight this tick @-@ box when the property should take preced@@ ence over other properties . here you can also set several markings .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor when the output is , this is always treated as a priority property . you will use this property rarely . the only case in which you possibly want to specify the attribute you may know that a particular application text is sent in another language than the one in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all properties in the field of speaker , which is most likely to use , click the standard speaker and then use to speaker , which is most likely to follow . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 is available for the last word order in queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number , the input 0 is needed ) . &quot;
k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr cras@@ hes immediately if it is started . I have de@@ bug support but I don &apos;t get re@@ tracking .
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is cras@@ hed and &amp; kt@@ ops ; it was probably finished . most likely , you need to add G@@ Stre@@ amer . at G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command G@@ ST register @-@ 0.@@ 8 . if the problem is not resolved , possibly a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ ather is not solved . you can try to update or un@@ install G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
the audio @-@ over@@ s over Al@@ sa doesn &apos;t work when I inter@@ play music simultaneously with another application . if I get a text order , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ine ; one . on the &amp; console ; a message appears to be said : &quot; to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system there is the problem that conflicts occur in al@@ sa , which prevent an simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . indications for possible solutions can be found on the website of the Al@@ sa @-@ Project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ Stock ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I have downloaded one additional voice for the festival from the Internet . I installed it and can use it in the festival , but k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice . &quot;
&quot; add in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / paste the new voice . as a guide you can use the other entries . if that &apos;s successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL where you have found the voice to the developer . &quot;
&quot; on the diamond card audio there is a setting speed . so this works , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be upgraded over the surrounding variable path . some synthes@@ iz@@ ers such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for inter@@ viewer as well . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the intercom speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ops . ( this is because the HTML file is converted to SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; according to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of &amp; HTML , and set the talk speed up . &quot;
I don &apos;t make it easy to read web pages with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker but &amp; kt@@ ops ; reads the web pages with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta the tag of S@@ able Gender doesn &apos;t seem to work out . so the festival does not produce any mistakes , the x@@ s@@ l file to convert SS@@ ML to S@@ aber Kabel has to convert SS@@ ML to S@@ aber Kabel . the same goes for VO@@ ICE @-@ tags . &quot;
I have added a separate string based filter and now I can go into &amp; kt@@ ma ; no more sat@@ r@@ ise - or go back . on the diamond orders will be shown the order before only from one proposition . what am I doing wrong ?
&quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ation characters ( point , question , compos@@ ings , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) must not be fil@@ tered . use a filter for this sign instead of a filter to pro@@ filing . &quot;
al@@ sa ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; sound Architecture ) . Al@@ sa is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ Stock ect@@ .org )
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or newer . note : make sure that the modules for G@@ Stre@@ amer are registered , by visiting the G@@ ST register before using G@@ Stre@@ amer . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stre@@ amer@@ .@@ fre@@ ed@@ ES@@ .org ) &quot;
&quot; some users experience in connection with Al@@ sa conflicts in the audio @-@ output . if your system does not matter , you cannot simultaneously play music and start a text . &amp; nbsp ; free@@ zes , if you can launch a text contract and then start another . possible solutions to this problem can be found on the website of Al@@ sa ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; with stand in July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support any real break . if you stop a text contract in &amp; kt@@ ops ; stopping , the current set will be read yet . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for the general adjustment of the intercom speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x with the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included . &quot;
&quot; have downloaded &amp; kt@@ ops ; downloaded as a tar@@ ball ( with tar @-@ packed archive ) , sign up as normal users and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a matching folder . change to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 , the module &amp; arts module will be removed , probably or at least created on request . &quot;
&quot; the following modules for voice interfaces are created by default . some of them have a run @-@ time dependent of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the directives of the Deb@@ ian distribution ) . the configure option for shut@@ down displays the configure parameters , which causes the move to change . &quot;
&quot; as default , &amp; kt@@ ine ; in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 installed . this folder is not listed in the variable variable $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR@@ S , you need to specify as an --@@ pre@@ fix = destination . &quot;

&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ am ; use first , check if your language matches is working properly . follow the instructions that you have received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; the quality of the voices is one of the best free T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers which is open source code . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices you can set volume , intercom speed , and pitch @-@ height with &amp; kt@@ ops . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . help to help you find the instructions provided with the festival . want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices , you must compile a supple@@ mentary module , hence you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on the transfer . &quot;
&quot; this vote opens up Festival 1,@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / 03 / Russian / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voice ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . choose a cy@@ ri@@ ll@@ ical ( 8 @-@ bit ) co@@ ding like for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
it is usually included in the &amp; Linux operating distri@@ butions . therefore look at the festival as first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the code must be adjusted to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the co@@ ding must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Ky@@ ri@@ ll@@ ery such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer . then the Festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ographic analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this produces the audio @-@ over@@ s . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete language entry system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . Festival generates them by &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German lyrics Di@@ phone . for more information please refer to .
&quot; in this procedure , additional Wr@@ apper code is added to Festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder files , but in the folder festival / lib / . instructions can be found under &quot;
I@@ MS German Festival is a changed version of the festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ votes . required is either Festival Version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival of

&quot; this hand@@ book explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; secure center , which allows the management of network interfaces , rout@@ ing and the DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; monitor center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings on a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; security centre ; can be called by selecting K menu @-@ contro@@ l@@ center ; &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; net@@ work@@ conf &quot; &quot; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , such as other settings from the &amp; Net@@ work@@ .@@ conf file ; creating a simple interface for the user to manage the following tasks : &quot;
after installation there will be a new module network settings in the &amp; secure center ; you can install the Network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting from k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; started .
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware is not capable of install . physical devices and their drivers must be installed and configured , so &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device even indicates , and allows setting the network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed when installing &amp; Linux ; installed and installed . network equipment later added , the drivers need to be loaded via adaptation of the following files , according to the kernel version . &quot;
&quot; the network settings will be loaded , if the option network settings is selected in the &amp; secure center ; -@@ index selected . at the start of the module network settings , this one , the used platform will be automatically recognized by the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be detected , the choice is offered from the list , which is best meets the distribution and rel@@ aying version . by flag@@ ging non @-@ again questions the setting can be met automatically . at the next start of network settings , this selection will automatically be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is possible only in system administration mode . before , all options are shown gray , which means that the settings can only be considered , the change is not possible . in the system administration mode , you can enter the button control mode at the right bottom of the module . it is required by entering the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three types : &quot;
the rider network interfaces is used for managing network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the tab network interfaces the following tasks can be performed :
the settings @-@ out network settings can set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button &apos; button &apos; setup ... in the dialog device set up .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Kno@@ wing Settings displays the dialog with further possibilities . &quot;
&quot; in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched by a D@@ H@@ CP / IP @-@ server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server automatically sends the necessary TCP / IP information to each system start , so no further adjustment can be required . in the selective list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system . &quot;
&quot; with the selection Manual can be made without your D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be defined . &quot;
&quot; if this option is marked , the system initi@@ ates the interface interface with the boats . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values available in this dialog are shown as the characteristics of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or activated depending on the need . single @-@ off network device can be activated by selecting from the list and click on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or activated depending on the need . off @-@ off of an activated network device is made by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
&quot; sets the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ network , which provides the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets . &quot;
&quot; if the computer is present more than one network interface , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers demand only IP addresses . if the computer htt@@ p is requested , DNA sol@@ ves this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the machine belongs to the attri@@ bution part of the horse@@ man name solution enables easy management of this list . entries may be added , removed or changed ad@@ den@@ .@@ DNS entries may be re @-@ ordered by selecting a single device or down@@ gra@@ dation in the list with buttons . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button &quot; &quot; Add ... &quot; from the group machine to the nam@@ able solution , a DNS server can be added . it will add the dialog New Nam@@ eser@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; first , you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click &quot; &quot; Add &quot; . &quot; the entry then is inserted in the list . &quot;
from the group Calcul@@ ator to select the name solution select an entry and then click the button Edit ... There will be the dialog editing .
&quot; the name of this well @-@ known machine describes calcul@@ ator @-@ to @-@ IP address material for TCP / IP sub @-@ system . it is used primarily by boats , if no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS server . &quot;
&quot; usually , the list contains some known computers some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses are supported . this is still in the Test @-@ containing version of IP should replace in future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be shown .
&quot; to enter the name of the well @-@ known computer and click &quot; &quot; Add &quot; . &quot; if the well @-@ known machine has multiple ali@@ ases , de button add multiple times and enter the other ali@@ ases name . &quot;
select an entry of a named calcul@@ ator from the list and select Edit .... The dialog friend will edit .
&quot; it may be one of the following tasks to be executed , then click OK , the list of static Ho@@ sts will be updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings shown in the Module settings are not immediately effective in the system . to enable the changes , must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command must be set . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net to download the latest version of the source text .
&quot; for installing the binary distri@@ butions ( mostly r@@ pm packages ) , it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed . &quot;
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply download the R@@ am package and install in one &amp; console ; with r@@ pm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool with graphi@@ cally surface such as the package or the installation tool of your distribution can be used . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not only , but additionally the development packages need to be used with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only by experienced users , but it is not difficult , &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; compile the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information on fundamental network technology will be given in the second section , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changing configuration files are discussed . &quot;
this section can not replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x you will find basic information about the integration of the PCs into a small ( home ) network .
IP networks operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found large spread . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . this description is currently focused on IP@@ v@@ 4 .
&quot; one of the most important information is to assign the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg . workplace is the Administrator @-@ Administrator , who may use a valid IP address or , if available , D@@ H@@ CP can not be chosen as desired ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up a separate small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a specially reserved area for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded in the Internet , therefore its arbitrary use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
for smaller networks are usually used addresses in the address of 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all machines are in the same sub @-@ net . &quot;
some addresses are reserved for special things 0.@@ 0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.@@ 0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route that is assigned to the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . the default route is needed for IP re@@ directing .
&quot; the AC @-@ address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . usually , the address is assigned to 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle . &quot;
&quot; in this section are the configuration files , which are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file sometimes changed dynam@@ ically if DSL connections are dynam@@ ically changed , so that it is not surprised if in case of active DSL connections a different content is set to be found there . &quot;
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

&quot; &amp; k@@ dat : is a backup program for tap@@ ing works on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first goal was to create a surface for tar , which also provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar to fast , selective un@@ packing . the second goal was the answer to a question that my wife asked : how much longer it takes when you secure it ? &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it needs to be involved from &amp; k@@ dat files . that can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat : draw the band back and reads the pre @-@ voltage information of the tape . realize &amp; k@@ dat : the pre @-@ spell on the tape isn &apos;t , you are asked if the band is form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; re@@ alizes &amp; k@@ dat : the pre @-@ spell , search for the appropriate index on your plate . cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index will be newly created . &quot;
&quot; if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the belt drives , in order to indicate that the band has been involved . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the belt can now be brow@@ sed through out@@ breaks of the entry for the band . &quot;
&quot; before throwing the tape , first of all , the integration must be solved . there are three methods to achieve this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat : through a change in the symbol for the band to realize that the integration of the band has been solved , and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger . &quot;
before a volume of &amp; k@@ dat files can be used it must be form@@ at@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
&quot; a band species must be form@@ at@@ ted before you can use to store data . this process does not conform to the form@@ atting with &amp; k@@ dat files , but this process does not have to happen before you are form@@ at@@ ted by the volume of &amp; k@@ dat files . Flo@@ ppy disk drives usually need a form@@ atting of the belt ahead , DAT drives . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band@@ name and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat , with the form@@ atting of the ball . all the data on the tape are lost automatically . after completion of the process , the belt is automatically integrated and is ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you encounter the backup process , you have to select the files to secure files , which can be done in three ways : &quot;
select a file or a folder in a local file tree . it will only be saved to this file or folder .
highlight a backup profile in the tree . only the files stated in the profile are saved .
highlight files in a local file tree with a tick . only the so marked files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
right click on the local file tree and select in the menu Si@@ zes ...
&quot; once the backup has been initiated , the dialog settings for backup . in this dialog , you can once again check the selected files and change settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog backup . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
highlight a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
highlight the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right click in one of the archives and select the menu entry .
&quot; once the exam has started , the dialog settings will be displayed for review . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the application folder for verification . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for review , the dialog review will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the exam and the data set and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can manage re @-@ manufacture , the files you need to be restored will be marked . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives which belong to the tap@@ ing work . it will only be restored to the selected file or sub@@ folders .
select the files you want from one of the archives from one of the archives . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are restored .
right click on a file or a folder in one of the archives and select another folder ...
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialog settings will appear for recovery . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the work@@ folder for restoration . &quot;
&quot; once you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog will be restored . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process , as well as the data set and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , it proves to be necessary to create the Band@@ inde@@ x@@ file on the basis of the band &apos;s contents . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the tape : &quot;
&quot; here , a backup profile created with the straight marked files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile : &quot;
&quot; the current level sub@@ folders , in which the backup should be made . the list of files to secure files will be automatically updated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; for all folder , which are listed under backup files , that only those files can be backed up in the same file system , like the folder . folder , which are on other fil@@ es@@ ystems , you can enter separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent of the others . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before the call of tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons files are over@@ thrown ; and lt ; files was not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up via the K@@ D@@ at menu item ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the full path to equipment for the belt drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ boot version of the band@@ wagon .
&quot; if this setting is active , transm@@ its &amp; k@@ dat , before the band is involved , the command is navig@@ ated to the drive . with some drives it is necessary before reading or writing operations . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , tries &amp; k@@ dat : it does not work on all band@@ ages . maybe this setting does not work on all belt drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , when solving the integration of &amp; k@@ dat files , the tape is automatically ej@@ ected . use this option not for flo@@ ppy Stream@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , tries &amp; k@@ dat : all drives support variable block@@ age size . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need to inform you in any case the block@@ age for your band@@ age . &quot;
if &amp; k@@ dat : form@@ at@@ ted a band is writing a file to the top of the tape . this file should only cover a storage block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows :
&quot; the format of this string is calcul@@ ator : second , whereby calcul@@ ator name is the full name of the system in which the volume was form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that has been form@@ at@@ ted since the epoch . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat files .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup . this symbol is only active if a band is involved .
&quot; the program is a &amp; k@@ de ; spect@@ ator for system protocols . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system enables the various protocol files . furthermore , a system allows quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
&quot; it helps users to understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is an simplified version of the protocol @-@ files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users , who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system deposited the various protocol files . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that appear on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced functions , with whose help the protocol files of certain programs can be fil@@ tered and evaluated . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful features . these include :
support for many different types of log files for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and will be explained in the other chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following scre@@ enshot shows &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available with whose help the individual protocol lines of a log file can be easily fil@@ tered and sort . the various options for sor@@ ting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
&quot; after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first started the main protocol of the system - the system prot@@ protocol - to open it , and it opens instead of it a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely not with system administration right . the protocol files usually find themselves under Linux normally in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually no enti@@ t@@ lement for reading . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected criterion or according to the strings . in default , the selection panel contains the listing next to the filter . then a log @-@ line contains only when in one of the columns the string of the filter searches are included . &quot;
&quot; you can of course select another entry . the character string of the filter key@@ note will then only be eliminated with the entries in the corresponding column . select the name of a process , so it shows you &amp; k@@ system log , which has been sent or created from this process . &quot;
this option is activated in default and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of the level error are displayed with a striking colour as protocol lines of level notice . the colored display of protocol lines can be switched on @-@ line dialog .
&quot; if you want to display only certain processes ( for example in the system protocols or on the cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can check the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case you use filtration bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can activate the option to jump to new lines in the context menu of the main window , in order to display all new additions to the coming protocol . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open up additional sub@@ windows and ad@@ minister . once you selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol for viewing . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you can find more current information on the supply sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; find also in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; Subversion archiving : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; - Archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following so named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
&quot; the System V In@@ it quickly developed as a standard for controlling the program boot at the high @-@ cycle system in the &amp; Linux world . namely , because it is easier to use , more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go here further on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
&quot; the in@@ it @-@ binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to make a machine on System V In@@ it , without a re@@ installing and re@@ format . therefore , you need to make sure the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are located directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following other folder :
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for any system service you want to start using the system or when moving to a different run@@ way . system services do not contain such things such as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such stuff as set@@ backs , which will only once run . such calls are to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should be on the one hand under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is actually not much use for it . you can also do a r@@ c.@@ sed in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to carry out something with the serial connection . &quot;
the kernel is searching for different places according to the program in@@ it and starts the first to find it .
the default run @-@ level is registered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should be in the beginning a line like the following :
&quot; at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the pre @-@ placed Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can restart something through your system and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you input -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry is linked to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d . &quot;
&quot; how does it start and stops in@@ it actually system services ? very simple : each of the scripts is so written , that it is an argument as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows : &quot;
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when a K contains , the script will start with the argument stop . if he involves a S , the script will start with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people wish to set up a simple way of set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server running , that only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; walk , which could also have a user @-@ running level , the &amp; b ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was laid out as user @-@ friendly as possible .
&quot; the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; using a mouse or another poin@@ ter is easy to not say trivial , just drag an entry from the range of avail@@ able system services to one of the six Run@@ level to launch it at this level ( or stop ) . &quot;
&quot; you can move scripts also between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within one level by changing it elsewhere . however , the entry is removed from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) . this happens only if they draw an entry from the range of avail@@ ble system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are moved , if you drag them to a new run@@ way . to simply select them from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert in the target range -- even then , if the same entry has previously existed in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sor@@ ting number of an application can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sor@@ ting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can once again try to insert the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : at present there is no possibility to restore entries , which were thrown into the trash . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the Tab@@ ulator button to enable the different work areas ( Av@@ ail@@ able system services , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor buttons to make a selection or below the previous ones . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another run@@ way , move it with cutting into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it into the desired run@@ way with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sor@@ ting number or the name of a request manually , press the input button to switch between different fields . use the tab@@ s key to change between different fields . close the dialog by means of the input button to accept the changes or press Es@@ c to reject the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . preferences are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they are stored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to preferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n and now the machine starts up @-@ resistant . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ ILO Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input key to launch in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run @-@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be ok ) .
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual for Distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way , such as system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simplified the configuration for the proprietary furniture programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan a expansion of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use another distribution : check if all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg , Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) simply finish without notice if your configuration files are not present or false . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; user . 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; user . &quot;
&quot; once you have made modifications , you need to save it . either using the appropriate icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry save in the menu file . &quot;
&quot; the main window is an easy application . the main window consists of two diamond cards , the user and user groups . to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it will be the dialog user or group properties . &quot;
&quot; some mapping cards are shown only if you have advanced system settings . only if you can choose space constra@@ int ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , you can make individual settings on which you can make individual settings . further mapping cards can be installed if shadow @-@ passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD Unix systems are installed . &quot;
the diamond card password appears if shadow @-@ passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as installed in BSD -@@ Uni@@ ces .
&quot; this car@@ tei@@ card appears only if for at least a built @-@ file system restriction ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a user / quot@@ a group on the file system ) . here , the space restrictions are specified in KB for each user : &quot;
these parameters can be set for each file system individually . the current file system is selected by means of the field file system .
&quot; the car@@ tei@@ card groups informs about the group belonging to the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , can be found within the prim@@ ate group . furthermore , the user can join in other groups by typ@@ ing them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the dialog &apos;s dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the menu user or group , or click the matching &quot; &quot; button &quot; &quot; button or select the selected group or the selected group . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the L@@ ILO boot manager , remove the boat password , remove and change the time up to the boats of the standard operating system to remove , modify operating systems , modify , modify and modify more . &quot;
