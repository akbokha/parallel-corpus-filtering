<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as a picture format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a loss of low compression salgents (deflate). a problem is however that this format has been adjusted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a licence-free and open pipe format that has been developed by Adobe Systems. DNG was developed on the TIFF / EP format and commits to the use of metadata. a handful of camera suppliers is now available and we hope to use the co-rated Canon and Nikon.</seg>

<seg id="391">"same: this method jushed the luminaire factor of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the Intensity Array will be as flat as possible. thus, it achieves very good results in enhancing the contrasts of an image, sometimes it produces only garbage. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in an image or destroy it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic abbreviation: this method maximizes the shade area in the red, green and blue channel. you select the dark and bright borderhues and jushes the red, green and blue channels on the complete histogram."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method enhances the contrast and the luminosity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values on the greatest possible area and a rejiustification of all values in between. this is only visible in winding images and can be a good correction for poor photos.</seg>

<seg id="399">"on the right above, a histogram is shown that dynamically is changed when you change one parameter. this histogram is very helpful because even in well illuminated images, most pixels have very small lamuminous values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colours or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminanz."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shade of the shade allows you to improve the shadow details of your photos or also down."</seg>

<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar isation. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what chemically possible is possible. another increase is finally generated a negativity that is not to produce on photopapier."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of solar production. the original image is the (1) and this is processed (2). the intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it is distinguished from a saturation by making the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simple, it embellishes many photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">"Velvia is the brand name for one on daylight optimized opposite color movie produced by the Japanese company Fujimovie. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot. the characteristics make him a film of choice for natural photography. also, the characteristics make him a mixture of photographers, especially those that barely distinguish landscapes."</seg>
<seg id="416">"the neonfilter simulates Neonlight on the contrasts. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeat the strength of the neonlight. with large images the filter the filter the whole CPU can be relieve for a moment."</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to correct the color counter and the luminosity of the photo. you can to experiment the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result you can use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">"if you can make a picture at bad light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: one too big saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation will be a good choice for saturation instead of increasing them. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple leukab / contrast / gamma is the tool of sound correction for improving the exposure. although the dialog on this tool seems very complicated, you need only the area of shooting. more concrete the three sliding steps below the histogram."</seg>

<seg id="479">"digitization came; put three different tools to the field of sharpening, each of you has advantages in other areas."</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpened is a traditional tool to sharpness. it is very fast and simple, but produces particularly in dark areas, grained images."</seg>
<seg id="481">Sharpness mask works at the contrast of edges to look a picture sharper. in fact it's no bit more psychovisual to remove it and it's a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">"focus is perhaps the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitized images need a correction of the sharpness. these elements are smaller than the resolution will thus observe a little blur. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are displayed on paper. SLR cameras usually need more resilient than normal cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">"with JPEG's images it is often applied to a camera internal sharpness. images in the blank format, on the other hand, must always be welded during the processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanner give a sharpness filter already during the reading of the image. if you turn off, you get the control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by drawing a photo with the edge-throwing depot. that allows you to call with the menu-entry corrosive sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="487">"however, you should not deal with caution because the results do not seem very natural: the sharpness increases the edge of edges, but amplifying the noise. in general, the viable technique for sharpening an image refocus. you can achieve more information about the menu entry into the menu. below, you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too cracking. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it sharpens. use the tool for soft signs with the menu item to relocate softening and experiment with settings. the showcase on the right of the dialogue shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blurred is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help you edit the image. the preview window shows the issue of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values create good results and should initially be tried out. an increase in radius or viewing will amplify the effect. if you get the sharpness mask too strongly, Raue and get the impression of grading in the proximity of sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">"the radius marks how many pixels on each side of a cannte is affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii, so they should therefore sharpen pictures best in their final resolution."</seg>
<seg id="493">"the amount marks the percentage between the original and the wired image added to the original, and thereby the strength of the sharpness is set."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the swelling value is a break from the maximum RGB value and the difference of difference. it can therefore be applied to a minimum difference between the tones of sharpening of sharpening sharps, therefore beauty defects in face, heavenly and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the unsharp masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the converted image (2). unsharp mask was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a corpora value = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & checking came; tool refocus on a picture by improving the edge of the sharpness. it used to use the copyright protected filter by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to undo a picture & quot; refocused quot; in which it is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. this is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. you can start it from the menu by drawing colors refocused in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice the circular fin works far better than the Gauß'sche Faltung. the Gauß'sche Faltung has a very long tail, which brings the mathematical outcome also from the source pixel, which is far from the original pixel. the FIR Wiener inverse is in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixel. that causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular edge sharpness: this is the radius of the circular fin. it is the most important parameter for using this module. it is the most important parameter for use of this module. you can put a higher value if your image is very blurred but then take note on Heiligenpons.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: a boost in correlation can help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values nearby 1, & eg. 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpness effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">"smoking filter: an increase in the filter filter can help you reduce artefacts. the filter may accept values of 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 is rarely helpful. if the filter quality is too low. a viable value is 0.03. a high value is 0.03. a high value will still be impaired."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauß'sche sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß'sche sharpness. in most cases, you should let this value on 0 to prevent annoying artefacts. if you use a value unauthorized zero, so you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"the size of the matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformationary rix. an increase in the matress size can produce good results, especially if you select great values for the circular edge or the Gaude's sharpness. however, note that the module is very slow when you select large values for these parameters. in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">The saving as well as loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any refocus parameters you have set will be stored for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all the cuts in color and Intense monitors on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before selecting the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, which leave later unpleasant artefacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the unzipped image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, unsharp masking produces better results as a sharpness. this could be caused by the blurred masking a larger neighborhood used as a sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically have to be blurred masissing always artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never be the effect of insharpness. for the Wiener filter you can show that it's the optimal linear filter. practical is the result of the FIR Wiener Filters is always at least as good as the imsharpness mask. the FIR Wiener filters is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small infocused picture:"</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color picture has to be corrected. this picture was made using a analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the Auto-Focus Linse.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for further information on the methods for the edge of the field of content in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator covers the sharpness of the area that was blacked out to generate a more natural sequel.</seg>
<seg id="514">"color tints allows a customized color for the pump. if you want a blue eyes instead of dark, you can adjust it here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image correction is one of the most far developed tools to not remove desired artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The algorithm algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various preference settings as set-points to simplify the restoration. the available settings are enumerated below:</seg>
<seg id="518">In case you want to use the filter settings fine you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail connotation [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to an evenly smoothness over the picture. a value of 0.9 should be sharp. please note that no sharpenance is needed to be subordinated."</seg>
<seg id="520">"direct value dependent Alpha [0,100]: a small value is spread evenly in all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film baskets or CCD rubles will create a high value of wave-like patterns. JPEG artifacts will best use a value close to 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"[0, 500]: this puts the maximum smoothing factor above all else. p then defines the relative smoothing. put this value suitable for the degree of smoke in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter is considered larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is done, as it is difficult to produce the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: returns to how often the algorithm is going through. normally, here is 1 or 2 out. "</seg>
<seg id="524">"Winkelo-wide da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropen Alpha. if Alpha is small chosen, there should also be small chosen. so note that small corner should generate a long run time. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral step [0,1, 10]: integral step into pixels. you should avoid the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixels smoothing and never greater than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: the More An quality you receive by selecting this option is low. it doubles but the term. we recommend it to allow him.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as well as charging make exactly this. any setting of image errors can be saved into a text file and later be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image failure is comparatively very fast at work. but it can take a very long time and take a high CPU load. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button break.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how picture mistake with little artefacts can be corrected. the module is made in a photo that was created in Guatemala city with a analogue camera. as you see there is a peculiar black fact that was created by a bad film storage during the journey. the original image is under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The digitization came; smoking reduction is a powerful tool to decrease bildrauts. it uses a protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">"this tool provides a selectable image filter to remove spots and other artifacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensory noises from the camera or Moially; effects of scanned images from books or magazines."</seg>
<seg id="532">"if you need more information about sensors of digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial."</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and a high standard sensitivity. it shows a grandeous noise which can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you only need the subwindow details and the window window advanced settings may remain with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time that the filter is needed per pixel and the image is blurred through the radius and the color in it is ragged and thus smaller faults."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controlled the pixel level. this value sets the pixel filter to a front. if it is lifted up, it will change the edges filter. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter details can no longer receive and noise or lubricate occurs once again."</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong can not occur the whole noise or spaceship can occur. put it on a value close to the maximum when you want to remove a watchman or JPEG artifacts want to lose without any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">"luminance: controls the illuminance of the picture. we recommend you either color or light density, to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details -settings."</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controlled the color intolerance of the picture. we recommend you either color or light density to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"Gamma: controls the gammatolerancy of the picture. this value can be used to increase the tolerable levels of the darker areas, which are typically stronger, but it also lubricates the shadow areas."</seg>
<seg id="541">"absorption: controls the adjustment of the phasenjattering absorption. this value is defined as quickly the adaptive filtering radius is responding to variations of the luminance. if it is lifted up, the edges may appear to occur. he can remove spacecraft and phasenjitter to the edges. he can remove spacecraft and is the recommended method for it."</seg>
<seg id="542">"storing and charging: these buttons are used exactly for it. all parameters for the noise reduction, which you have set, can be stored into the filesystem and later loaded."</seg>
<seg id="543">"this is an example of how smoking reduction can change your lives. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrective with (2), which was applied with default settings."</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is crisp for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use it with the smoothness. the showcase on the right side of the dialogue shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The digitization came; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo products.</seg>
<seg id="546">"this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's Raul, scraping, scratches, compression-arteed and local bugs that emerge in digital, original or retroactively digitized pictures. the smoothing is done along the image and therefore maintains the content as well as the human eye."</seg>
<seg id="547">"the same algorithm can be used for color and text color. the algorithm for restoration is carried out using a different tool, the image error correction, the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / Franches and is part of the CImg project."</seg>
<seg id="548">"JPEG artifacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a lossy compressionist comic quot; - small standards that are to be seen in unzipped image. this attitude is intended to correct these problems."</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons Save as and Download exactly this. every setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and later be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. but it can take a very long time and take a high CPU load. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with like-shaped noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the infamous film baskets in the faces. the original image is under (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>

<seg id="922">"in this area, you can define how the HTML pages are to look like. most settings are clearly, which is why they are not specifically formulated."</seg>
<seg id="923">"on the page you can adjust different resolutions on the pictures. by doing so, those who want to view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no more images download those for example a resolution of 1600x1200."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you have specified. so he can browse your pictures with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time. if it wants to get an image larger, he changes to higher resolution."</seg>

<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. generally see pictures with this property better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn on anti-aliasing and connects & Povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as a standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because each pixel is adaptive and adaptive because each pixel is repeatedingly divided again and adaptive because each pixel will always be split up again and adaptive because the recurve depends on the calculated colour-values."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"when you choose the first method, POV-Ray pursues a beam the pixel. if the difference between the finishes to the neighboured pixels surpasses the previous threshold. if you adjust the lowering value on 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points is calculated, with a lowering value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the predetermined threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels that are individually pursued and can be checked on further subdirectories. the maximum depth of recursion can be set with the lowering."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"a further possibility to reduce the aliasing effect is to reduce the production of noise for the beam process, called iittering. if you turn on Jittering, changed & Povray; the rays are around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>

<seg id="1521">"--preset standard '= This setting should usually provide maximum transparency for most people and most of the music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>

<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you definitely want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"the & CD; information that entered manually or fetched from the freeDB over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can commit / used with & audio creator; and the code program to create the folder and file name, as well as the characteristics of the music files."</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with codification, there is often a combination of programs for the code and these parameters here. the manual or assistance to the codes explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example, to add the & CD; title to the keyword (English: day) if MP3s are coded with lame, the switches must be added from lame and the title parameters of & audiocreator; the result looks like this: '-tt}...'."</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button labeling in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"this is what the freeDB is: a free database, in which people can download the audio CDs, so that all others can download this information instead of text: & CD; title, artist, names of pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself."</seg>

<seg id="1532">"in & audiocreator; actively you can choose a tick-box (sending an address). for the use of freeDB it may be used with a different (counterfeit) address used in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears that the e-mail address is not used by the server (This may only know the programmer who has checked the code.)"</seg>
<seg id="1533">"in many countries, there are copies of the main database. if & the audiocreator; used to use freeDB, the geographically can be used on the next lying mirror server. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines."</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a list of reflections on the online call of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded (usually monthly) just the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">"there are rumors that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more accurately, search in source code....

<seg id="1537">"to save the illuminated WAV files, the encoders and thus the desired file format can be chosen. for the first opening there are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a loss of loss for audio data) on the tab. other codes can be added on this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"the encoding package must be installed by the internal Linux distribution before the code is used, and this is also necessary for the predefined codeners. further information on codeners are in the section Welding Kodiers."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a Kodierers you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a single window (eg, console). you must be replaced by the name of the installed code."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"this can have many causes. check out the device name of the & CD; / DVD drives, the writing and reading of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;). try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could give an indication of what is wrong."</seg>

<seg id="1661">"in this section, the patches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard are shown. the general usage is as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="1662">"note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that GM patches in the right sequence exist (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and neither line for one of 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional All KeysTo M is needed to place all notes that need this instrument to put on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported by a gun (GM-patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. using sound 60), which is similar to a gun. to do so, enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if now a MIDI file should play a note with Patch 127 (defenses one), it takes place 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant that each tone represents another face instrument (drums, pelvis, maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the tone represents the tone-height of the ever same drum (as some are some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">KEYMAP section is needed to indicate how sounds are shown on a certain channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the order of the lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you must create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and any instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keyboards are used mainly to tone sounds on the perklift channel. take a look as the included Keyboards.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to make some channels to others. if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel, you can simply do it in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion to a certain channel (General MIDI to channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI-Devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following patterns:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"n it is the channel that is pictured on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keymap is needed to use the name for this channel. in this case, all events are ignored to change the patch on this channel. in this case patch is used x x."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The option ForcePatch can be useful for example to always use the perk patch on the perklift channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for Pitchbenderratio indicates in which proportion of Pitch-bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI-file sends a Pitch-bender event, then this with the formula n * (r / 4096) is calculated and then transmitted. the value 4096 is used, so that in the map file is not a decimal (total)."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM gives you a keyboard, which should play a pitch-bending event with the value 4096, a tone higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards tend to play two notes up to an octave higher. to try to try a bit 'tmid on your keyboard."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, just open the dialog MIDI settings. this can be found in the menu under Settings, point MIDI settings"</seg>

<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument. if you have changed a tool, the button is not more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to view the played notes. view in the menu Settings under the point of canalview: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the pace of a song. so, for example, a song is too fast to follow the text you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played. it includes the notes, the speed, speed, & etc.. this can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians playing the same notes in a very different way."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I can force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything."</seg>

<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantapSaul; for normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language that you like most. therefore this chapter describes how I make a & PHP; -document tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">"before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantapSaul; repository, if any one has done it for you."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"there are two parts in this process. first, you must create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you have to create the docrc file. we will leave the second part with you, the second we treat it here."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"# KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc. = path, relative to this file, for example php42 / # elements in the main index Top Level = Section1.4.1 = Sec2.3.html 2 = Section1.4.1 = Sec2.3.html 2 = 3 2.html 2 = tag 2.html 2 = tag 2.html 2 = tag 3.html 2 = tag 3.html 2 = tag 3.html"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can now see the & PHP documentation:"</seg>
<seg id="2062">"# KDE Config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element top element = Table of content, # Testting Started = Adverting Started = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic syndrome .html..."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that there is subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known border for the chess engine (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the index directory is referenced directly to a file (and consequential at the top of the building control & mdash; folder will be shown!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Space influence nothing but watch on & und & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantapSaul; resources are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"the content of the content is the area of the docrc file which is intended for the design of the context-sensitive aid. for example, when writing a & PHP; H for context-aid, the documentation would be shown directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (Context List) and the file-linking lines."</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separated context-elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc simply by $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as specified in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"if you are sure these are good and worth to be shared, submit your docrc files with a description of important information, for example what documentation is used to the & quantapoto; -Repository, for the use by the & quantapSaul; community. you will not be rich, but proud to have been proud of having worked with the best web development platform."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"with & quantapSaul; you are not alone. it is possible to divide the departing resources (DTEP packages, toolmaking with promotions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:"</seg>
<seg id="2071">"resources can be sent by means of e-mail to friends, partners or otherwise. at different places there is an email notification, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, tool toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the scripts tree."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all other & quantappers; users can download them. the contributions are checked and only available if our team needs them as accurate and user-free for publication. thus, the source of resources ensures that there is a GPG / PGP key. thus, the source of resources is ensured, both for our team and for later users."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"when uploading, you will be asked for their private GPG key (the Passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can have a look. in the dialog New resource will need to stay empty) and with click OK the uploading will be started."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"the uploading can upload from the menus DTD DTD package (DTEP), tool toolbar, and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"after downloading a resource, even before installation, examines & quantapSaul; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signature. in case of problems it can be warns. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the specification of the originator of the resource."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"it is possible to work on XML-languages, which currently is not supported by & quantapSaul; the creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of day files can be necessary in tag XML format. there is the simpler way to convert a DTD automatically to a DTEP package."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"the conversion can be started from the DTD loading and conversions of a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description, which is to be used. afterwards, the following dialog appears:"</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directories: the newly created & DTEP; will be written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>

<seg id="2080">"setting the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & quantapSaul; following the transformation of the & Patptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility."</seg>
<seg id="2081">"in & quantapSaul, there are some key concepts. to understand this and get full benefit from & agonizing; this chapter attempts to get familiar with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to bring them exactly these concepts without understanding & quantapoto; little benefit."</seg>
<seg id="2082">"in & quantapSaul, the working area is divided into three areas: global, locally and project-related. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantapoto."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"global elements are available to anyone who is & quantapiens. utilizing tools is all that is marked as global, in the common folder structure of & quantapSaul; this enables the group of administrators to ensure different toolsets, actions and patterns in the global tree allow each to be available in a multi-user environment on the system."</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web developers for a single user. these are custom patterns and toolmaking. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">"project-related elements are available only within a specific project. this can be all from & CSS; -patterns to tooling with special promotions, specifically for the files of a particular project. simply said this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which is the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"the & quantapSaul; -MDI; consists of several main areas: the Editors window, the manageviews, the carteiites with information and toolmaking. please beat in, and for more information on these areas."</seg>
<seg id="2087">"you can click the diamond plate with the right mouse button, to recharge a context menu with the current documents, re-load, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document."</seg>
<seg id="2088">"right-click on the editing range, lead to a further context menu regarding the processed documentation section on how basic editing steps (cut / paste / paste), editing the file under the mouse cursor or opening the file when the string is called a file under the mouse cursor."</seg>
<seg id="2089">"at the top of the Editor's toolbar, the toolbar is located. currently, & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as a standard for which a set of machine tools is shown. in the course of the further construction of & quantapSaul, the toolbar will be adapted to the new functions and associated users."</seg>
<seg id="2090">"the use of toolmaking is really easy. if you want to insert a single day, e.g. & lt; then click on the icon that tag the day. now, you can insert the data for this straight, you can insert in a dialog different fields."</seg>
<seg id="2091">"the manageviews (QIT;) allow it to navigate in the information on & quantapSaul; navigate, to open and roam. in the representation of the mapping modules are available for files, project, pattern, documents, scripts, attributes, and documentation."</seg>
<seg id="2092">"project management is a powerful tool, which provides & quantapSaul. this view displays all files in the project and allows the administrator of the files in the project by means of right mouse click. actions like adding, removing, uploading, or deleting the files from storage media can be performed using the contextual menu."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"another possibility of & quantlers; it is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; We are open to all possibilities."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"templates can be divided into three categories, depending on what context they are used. the category depends on & quantapoto; global templates are always available, local templates only available for the relevant user and templates in projects are available only in the project. more to templates is available."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"here you can find information about the available scripts. the concept of integration in Global, Local and Project works here. by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information on a script. on the right mouse button are further functions available, such as the script to start, edit or send by email."</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view one shows the internal structure of the active document. by links-clicking an element the cursor in the document is set to the position of the element. by right-clicking an element it opens up a list of commands in terms of navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">"this tree appears under the other manageviews. with it, maneuver can change attributes and namespace. that allows the content of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"here, the complete documentation on the web technology for your development can be found. it can be downloaded pre-packed documentation for & quantapSaul; from the quantapiens; 'documentation site you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be addressed, edited and viewed."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"by default, & quantapiens; two carvings at the bottom of the window can be reached on the usable information: the message window and the problem window."</seg>
<seg id="2100">"this diamond driver displays information on each in Quanta current script. such, for example, the DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD will be shown."</seg>
<seg id="2101">"this diamond rider shows all the errors in the market-up of the current document. & quantapSaul; scripts, which are executed, give all error messages (so there are) in this window."</seg>
<seg id="2102">"the & quantapSaul; toolmakers are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the respective command. the chocolate bar of the toolbar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in & agonizing."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"another function of & quantapSaul; is the ability to send a toolbar with email; if they receive a toolbar in an email, they can secure these in & quantapSaul; like any other way to secure and load!"</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adapt the location of & quantaplus files on your system. for this purpose autoconf has a number of options to get to the configure script. to see a complete list of options available to the configure script. / configure --help one. the options are easy to understand and not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"if you have problems at starting from & quantapSaul, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 am folder. also, you should make sure that is not an older version of & kde; 3 in the path before their bin folder. same is true for & Qt."</seg>
<seg id="2106">"& quantapSaul; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantapSaul, became optimized for a quick web development and combines a matured development environment with a variety of powerful functions."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"during the endeavor to create the best & HTML, -Editor, the developers of & quantapSaul began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantapSaul would be? well, this would make it to the absolutely greatest web development tool for & kde; so it was done."</seg>

<seg id="2110">"this allows WebDevelopers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can increase productivity dramatically. by using comitted actions, scripts and tooling, the automation can increase almost every task. through the program compressor, they can be able to remember without any scripts of scripting language.

<seg id="2282">"the merging was very complicated because one of the contributors had been made many changes and at the same time, at the same time, another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts in bringing together."</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program used to me only changed the changed lines, but I could not see what changed exactly within these lines. and there was no evidence on the places where you might have changed just the rebirth. this change was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">So that was the beginning. the first version of & b diff3 could represent differences within a row and changes to white signs. later a lot more useful features were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it into the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparative window."</seg>
<seg id="2286">"a function which did a lot of work, was the same and merge from folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost in a full-fledged file browser."</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way-together is fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently of one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously indicates the expected result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three Quell files in combination:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& Rdiff3; also helps you with the same and merge complete folder. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder:</seg>

<seg id="2291">"if a file is equal, and the other differs in a line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files are equal to the same name, but in different folders, you can ease the typing work by simply writing the file name of the first file. example:"</seg>

<seg id="2299">You can also use dragging and insert: just drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it drop him via a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">"which idea is behind it? sometimes, a file contains a number of similar functions. if you want to find out how much these functions are, it would be a relatively great effort. you would have to just download two appropriate files, put them in & diffuse3; now you can copy the relevant sections simply, paste and then compare."</seg>

<seg id="2303">"in the upper part of each text window is the info line. the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the drawing number of the first visible line in the window.

<seg id="2924">"for all folder, which are listed under backup files, that only those files can be backed up in the same file system, like the folder. folder, which are on other filesystems, you can enter separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar independent of the others."</seg>

<seg id="2926">The name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before the call of tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons files are overthrown; and lt; files was not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set up via the KDat menu item... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to equipment for the belt drive (normally / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-reboot version of the bandwagon.</seg>
<seg id="2931">"if this setting is active, transmits & kdat, before the band is involved, the command is navigated to the drive. with some drives it is necessary before reading or writing operations."</seg>
<seg id="2932">"if the option is switched on, tries & kdat: it does not work on all bandages. maybe this setting does not work on all belt drives."</seg>
<seg id="2933">"if the option is switched on, when solving the integration of & kdat files, the tape is automatically ejected. use this option not for floppy Streamers."</seg>
<seg id="2934">"if the option is switched on, tries & kdat: all drives support variable blockage size. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you need to inform you in any case the blockage for your bandage."</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat: formatted a band is writing a file to the top of the tape. this file should only cover a storage block on the tape. the content of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">"the format of this string is calculator: second, whereby calculator name is the full name of the system in which the volume was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that has been formatted since the epoch."</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat files.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2940">"the program is a & kde; spectator for system protocols. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who can't know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system enables the various protocol files. furthermore, a system allows quick access to information about problems that occur on their server."</seg>
<seg id="2941">"it helps users to understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is an simplified version of the protocol-files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users, who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system deposited the various protocol files."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that appear on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore tries to provide some advanced functions, with whose help the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated."</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 & ksystemlog; a number of useful features. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files for the format of the syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and will be explained in the other chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screenshot shows & ksystemlog; functions are available with whose help the individual protocol lines of a log file can be easily filtered and sort. the various options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after the start, & ksystemlog; first started the main protocol of the system - the system protprotocol - to open it, and it opens instead of it a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; very likely not with system administration right. the protocol files usually find themselves under Linux normally in the folder / var / log, for the normal user usually no entitlement for reading."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected criterion or according to the strings. in default, the selection panel contains the listing next to the filter. then a log-line contains only when in one of the columns the string of the filter searches are included."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can of course select another entry. the character string of the filter keynote will then only be eliminated with the entries in the corresponding column. select the name of a process, so it shows you & ksystem log, which has been sent or created from this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in default and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of the level error are displayed with a striking colour as protocol lines of level notice. the colored display of protocol lines can be switched on-line dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to display only certain processes (for example in the system protocols or on the cron protocol), so you can check the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the samba server. in this case you use filtration bar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can activate the option to jump to new lines in the context menu of the main window, in order to display all new additions to the coming protocol."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"& ksystemlog; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open up additional subwindows and administer. once you selected a subwindow, select a protocol for viewing."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.org. Dort you can find more current information on the supply sources of & ksystemlog;</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; find also in the following folder of the & kde; Subversion archiving: ksystemlog; in & kde; - Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following so named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the System V Init quickly developed as a standard for controlling the program boot at the high-cycle system in the & Linux world. namely, because it is easier to use, more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go here further on historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the init-binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to make a machine on System V Init, without a reinstalling and reformat. therefore, you need to make sure the old Init was removed from there if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are located directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following other folder:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for any system service you want to start using the system or when moving to a different runway. system services do not contain such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such stuff as setbacks, which will only once run. such calls are to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should be on the one hand under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is actually not much use for it. you can also do a rc.sed in / etc / rc.d if you want to carry out something with the serial connection."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for different places according to the program init and starts the first to find it.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default run-level is registered in / etc / inittab. you should be in the beginning a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the pre-placed Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can restart something through your system and execute the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the correct scripts? if you input -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry is linked to one of the scripts in the directory init.d. "</seg>
<seg id="2968">"how does it start and stops init actually system services? very simple: each of the scripts is so written, that it is an argument as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and when a K contains, the script will start with the argument stop. if he involves a S, the script will start with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people wish to set up a simple way of set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server running, that only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; walk, which could also have a user-running level, the & b; & kdm;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was laid out as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"the use of & ksysv; using a mouse or another pointer is easy to not say trivial, just drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six Runlevel to launch it at this level (or stop)."</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can move scripts also between Runleveln or change the position within one level by changing it elsewhere. however, the entry is removed from its original Runlevel (or its position). this happens only if they draw an entry from the range of availble system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved, if you drag them to a new runway. to simply select them from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert in the target range -- even then, if the same entry has previously existed in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an application can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can once again try to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: at present there is no possibility to restore entries, which were thrown into the trash. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the Tabulator button to enable the different work areas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor buttons to make a selection or below the previous ones."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry into another runway, move it with cutting into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it into the desired runway with inserting (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of a request manually, press the input button to switch between different fields. use the tabs key to change between different fields. close the dialog by means of the input button to accept the changes or press Esc to reject the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in the $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preferences are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they are stored by & ksysv; changes to preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runleveln and now the machine starts up-resistant. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO Prompt linux single and press the input key to launch in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default run-level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be ok).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have some system services with & ksysv; for running under Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual for Distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way, such as system services are started in these distributions, simplified the configuration for the proprietary furniture programs of these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan a expansion of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you use another distribution: check if all configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg, Apache or httpd) simply finish without notice if your configuration files are not present or false."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that this manual can be added."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & user. 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">"to start with & user; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & user."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"once you have made modifications, you need to save it. either using the appropriate icon of the toolbar or the entry save in the menu file."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"the main window is an easy application. the main window consists of two diamond cards, the user and user groups. to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double-click on the entry. it will be the dialog user or group properties."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some mapping cards are shown only if you have advanced system settings. only if you can choose space constraint (Quota) for users, you can make individual settings on which you can make individual settings. further mapping cards can be installed if shadow-passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd as in BSD Unix systems are installed."</seg>
<seg id="2994">The diamond card password appears if shadow-passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd as installed in BSD -Unices.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"this carteicard appears only if for at least a built-file system restriction (Quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable by the file quota user / quota group on the file system). here, the space restrictions are specified in KB for each user:"</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set for each file system individually. the current file system is selected by means of the field file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the carteicard groups informs about the group belonging to the selected user. the standard group, to which the user belongs, can be found within the primate group. furthermore, the user can join in other groups by typing them in the large field."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"the dialog's dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list."</seg>
