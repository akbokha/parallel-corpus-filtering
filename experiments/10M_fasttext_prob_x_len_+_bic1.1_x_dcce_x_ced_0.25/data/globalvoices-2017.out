although I had visited the US since 2012 at least once a year I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely great .
&quot; as many of my generation I have grown up with American movies I have danced with American music , American authors have read and operated his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had a very profound impact on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican Let@@ ter , who covered with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as Jura @-@ Stu@@ ed to the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil mag@@ nat@@ es who had his interest inclined to occupy . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to Meth@@ od Man , &quot; I was &quot; as if it is absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year that I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only intensified . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country where I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be that you are , and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I had even written a very warm love @-@ book about its size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the xen@@ ophobia and racism of this man .
&quot; the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me , as he deals with his de@@ dness . &quot;
he never holds up behind the mountain with his view how to say so beautiful .
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks of how a former colleague put it , and explains publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African American and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted for him in s@@ wis@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number that has ever been nominated by the party &apos;s nom@@ ination candidate . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans , who support this big@@ ot@@ illa person , I asked me ? &quot;
I could not reconcile Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
&quot; for example , like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the journalist program , who occupies people from around the world , a deeply glorious man , with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; the Tr@@ umps World view not coinci@@ ded with the present editor of Peter Bh@@ atia , the present editor of &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bh@@ atia and I met us at our common love for basketball , and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at stake . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ umps In@@ intolerance also stands in contrast to the generosity that I experienced during Sandy B@@ ahr , who live their lives long the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot;
she adap@@ ts her to the dedication of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es who helped me with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
&quot; then , there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise coun@@ sel helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and their values are embo@@ died down my love for America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump had eased his way to the nom@@ inee of Republi@@ can presidential data , they offered me a grip and the counterpart to his restricted vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans , usually White , the presidency of a man , despite - or maybe because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the debate with the idea that people have voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared its racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to overlook these things , broke me almost the heart . &quot;
maybe it &apos;s unfair to call the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as a rac@@ ist .
&quot; to arrange people , one of my friends said , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is superficial and dis@@ respectful and indicates a in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows the people that their worries and fears about the h@@ ectic changes in their communities will not be considered .
&quot; could it be that these voters , of which most are white , have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to regain control of a country that she disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they perhaps wanted to say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
perhaps .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comment@@ ated the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different than he . &quot;
&quot; BT@@ WC . WC . WC . : as much as &quot; &quot; drawing up the White against all the other eth@@ ni@@ cities ; &quot; &quot; play from white in touch on the wh@@ ites and whi@@ plas@@ h , as called the great Van Jones , has exactly killed what America has done so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether the myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - whatever belief or background you like , America is definitely welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this land chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ man , whose history as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of Donald Tr@@ umps , however , a huge part of the White House of America gives this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the Ru@@ der , they say . &quot;
&quot; for all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
at a manifestation for Hill@@ ary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , could have my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked . &quot;
&quot; the crowd rep@@ lied with a loud &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; bro@@ t the quantity . &quot;
&quot; have Latin , a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; answered them .
A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! they were called , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; could someone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a voting and loud &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is this not your America . &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son fell , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; that is now Tr@@ umps Land , said the message . &quot;
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could not find space in this new America .
and it breaks my heart to me .

out of misery to the stars : these Latin American children can not spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish trash

what has the Mexican Musik@@ schule of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero municipality in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city C@@ ate@@ ura ?
&quot; the music played in both places not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a big garbage dump , just 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; an ancient colonial city , which is popular among tourists but worlds from nearby prehistoric ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen . &quot;
for some years now La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Music Association ) has been playing in the municipality : a Symphony Orchestra in children and adults who have found an opportunity to overcome the surrounding poverty .
a musical school with 100 students is a central interest for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for its Drug abuse and the gangs of bondage . &quot;
&quot; however , this changed after a random meeting with a French pilot , who started a musical project and the youth offered a rare hope of hope . &quot;
the young band@@ members take their obligations to the music group very seriously and writes the local press not@@ ci@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
&quot; once they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to meet their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they come always l@@ ach@@ ingly and with bright eyes and play in the busy you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ colo , clar@@ inet , flute , forest horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ go and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from garbage
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments that are made of re@@ mixed waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with recur@@ rent instruments that consist of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura where the recycled led under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ vez so have begun to transform parts of apost@@ asy . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ it@@ ating G@@ ins , Brat@@ schen , C@@ elli , bass guit@@ ars , guit@@ ars , sa@@ x@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and perc@@ ussion , all produced from the rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire covers classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles , from Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez , a local econom@@ ist and musician instructor of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , to the early days : &quot;
&quot; first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se , and we had to teach at the same place , when the parents worked in the trash the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children . &quot;
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : a made from waste from the violin .
today there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments of recur@@ rent material and that is called The recycled Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) shows the musical performance on :
the world produces about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish every year .
&quot; those who live with him and live by him are the poorest - like people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational spectacle from trash to music around the world .
the orchestra has even played his music from Pope Francis .
these East African countries show how technology and team work can be fought for illegal fishing
photo © F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that combat wild illegal fishing .
&quot; written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that targeted about international , practiced solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
re@@ publication occurs within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to share content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was at that time known that this ship had already operated illeg@@ ally in li@@ beri@@ an waters of illegal fishing , before it was the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were over accordingly and little inclined to welcome a ple@@ dge of this species on their coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seychelles mobili@@ zed themselves rapidly against the ship . they refused to place one of their har@@ bours , and refused to give him a fishing place of fishing . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; urine suddenly was the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply refused &quot; , &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leit@@ motif of the Ken@@ yan fisheries authority . he is part of a team that discovered the ship at his time and followed . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then exp@@ elled from the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , due to pl@@ undering of fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which protects criminal practices and protect resources , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal fishing stop ) . &quot;
&quot; the members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries , which at that time had driven their prime minister out of their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and working together . they exchange information and stand each other at where it is illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable trust project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally . this project provides F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is regulated by definition un@@ regulated : what is captured , it is hidden because of it extremely difficult to trace . therefore , illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing from regions . &quot;
&quot; by the deliber@@ ate abnorm@@ alities of existing laws , by means of which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm the delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; however while actions against illegal fishing they were hin@@ dered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the sn@@ ail , with the information between individual countries , the actions occur in real time , with trac@@ eable on F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , the individual countries can exchange views with each other for example lists , news on suspi@@ cious activities or details that can be noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive , if they move around the open sea , using satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to identify the authorities , the ships that fish in bot@@ bot@@ tled areas - such as such , which suggests that a ship charges its caught fish on the road to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such studies may show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence , where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a criminal ister . &quot;
&quot; countries that are opposed to illegal fishing are based on this information then refuse the acceptance of such vessels in their ports . what means that the ships will not sell their cargo to their cargo . and that they may even be forced to pay for sanctions , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; it is then about significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worth . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , Chairman Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
the aforementioned platform was created to attract 20 million USD to lost sales and lose the eight members of the network H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i every year due to illegal fishermen who penetrate into East African waters .
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fishing plants , where@@ ab@@ outs the region &apos;s commercial fishing from all over the world . at this stage , illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; among their practices , among other things , these actions count as the sailing under false flag , counterf@@ eit roy@@ alties , indication of fanta@@ sies , the fish protected species and the fish in nature conservation areas . &quot;
&quot; &quot; they specifically use the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non @-@ incomplete control system . &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; previously , a ship was able to fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &quot; You don &apos;t dar@@ ing my port . &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &apos; and precisely this legal no@@ stri@@ l tries to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
so far the closed front functions .
since its inception F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i was involved in over 30 investigations of susp@@ ects .
&quot; it has found criminal networks exposed , the fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identities and it has per@@ sever@@ ing ships . &quot;
&quot; because of its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far to the organised crime &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that is to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to make precise ships precise .
photo with friendly permission of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always developed further , also helps to track the illegal ships that are happy to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishing use highly refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . and we try to cross @-@ crossed , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at tracking , an NGO , which also deals with fishing data and F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot;
some of the ships also turn off their automatic identification systems as they can no longer be irrit@@ ated by satellites .
&quot; Cop@@ eland therefore helps to build a system that combines different information levels . it is intended to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i , crimin@@ ell ships with greater precision . &quot;
one model program
&quot; however , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global issue of illegal fishing ? &quot;
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch together with Google and the marine Protection Organisation Oc@@ e@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data , and by which the position of each trac@@ eable ship can be displayed worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; meeting with the neighbors to get a better picture of what is what is doing - that is simply meaning &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts has a similar project to run in which a global system permits the persecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only felt criminals , but they are also deter@@ red . &quot;
&quot; ships used earlier without a license , and hardly reck@@ oned with consequences , know that they will be observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i countries meanwhile have a 33 % increase in fishing sales , since fishing boats purchase more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board locks , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that now we also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , there are several hundred million dollars from illegal fishing each year . &quot;
&quot; there are six countries joined together in 2015 , so called West Africa Task Force . now they are fighting illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With security , the aim is to let more such initiatives and structures arise in other regions as well , &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member states recently opened his first major triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was on the road under false flag . and not only the ship was also without a license and were used to tow networks , which meanwhile forbidden . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also steep@@ ed in har@@ b@@ ted waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with taking place of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 put a strong sign that they are against illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time evidence that such a particular , collaborative way working method works in the entire world sea . Emma Br@@ yce is freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London . she writes on the subject of environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;
&quot; their articles will appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and The Guardian . location in Venezuela turns on to : demonstrations in several cities with the aim to regain the country &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations .
they are regarded as protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela had rejected the amendment of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations about the political and economic crisis of the country ran into emp@@ t@@ ying on the streets . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( e.g. : the reg@@ ression of Venezuela ) can be found both images of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate is also managed in other parts of the country - among other things in the Bar@@ inas region , in the Andes @-@ regions Mé@@ rida and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in central @-@ north @-@ eastern Bundestag Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and at Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country deterior@@ ates continuously , which makes itself noticeable in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicine . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of meeting the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance of a fundamental change ; ultimately , however , a re@@ election of a new election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting with Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ized in her latest article in the context of the state of government . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and violence exists among the highest around the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and comprehensive lack of food and medicine was considered to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and set a new governance code . &quot;
&quot; the electoral electoral Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( approximately : round table of the Democratic unit ) , in which the opposition to the president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro were joined in . here , the demonstrators had planned to join the president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro &apos;@@ in to the president of 2015 . here , the trial was planned against President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro &apos;@@ in . this is where the trial against President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro &apos; was planned to continue on the 3rd of November , the blocking of the referendum would continue to persist . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter among others as follows :
&quot; it is the time of Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday , nationwide strike , and on 3 November all between Car@@ acas and Miraflores palace . &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , pictures , which tell of disputes , as well as reports of repression and abuse . &quot;
&quot; particularly large waves , the news of poli@@ cem@@ an repression in the centrally located city of Marac@@ ay . &quot;
there the demonstrators returned to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves from the police and armed endor@@ sement of the government according to their own statement .
&quot; hours later , they could leave the cathedral safely but the protests went on . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstrators tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ state T@@ á@@ chir@@ a : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a bear no skirts , because otherwise you could see something that many nation@@ alists do not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an Info@@ graphic makes the round , which forms the scale of oppression per day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship has sup@@ pressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a criminal proceedings - this has now been proven in the eyes of many innumerable people on the street .

&quot; other vital these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , made a little against the disastrous economic crisis , and he rather prefer to keep critical voices . &quot;
they have taken us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches always take more of frequency and intensity .
&quot; some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media , they were too hungry to participate in a strike , rather than to work or buy shopping . &quot;

the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ in@@ ean city Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now said within the framework of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera Process in the province of Córdoba against his father . &quot;
&quot; during the process , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated that were committed during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
&quot; starting at the office , the same name as his father contribute to the brutal military operations in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough . &quot;
he retained his family secrecy for himself in 34 years .
in the situation at that time I believed that was fine .
I felt like a secret magic .
as a child with 15 years you don &apos;t notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
&quot; at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ terer and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was geno@@ cides . during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was from 1976 to 1978 to deputy commander of the secret service department 141 in prison La Per@@ la . &quot;

&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had experienced the scale of atrocities that he experienced as a boy , and he said before a Federal Court against his own Father . &quot;
his story shows what great power has a parent over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; as my father began to take myself to the military base , I often went with us into the sports hall . there I was star@@ ved with a young boy , who made combat sport . &quot;
all called it &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it .
he said :

&quot; for that reason , he offered me to go back into the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he said to me , I would become a secret . &quot;
&quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it was fine . for so , my father had taken me up . &quot;
on the military base I had to destroy Pap@@ ers who had heard the prisoners .
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda , books , simply everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ There are the prisoners being tor@@ tured &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
&quot; during the first and last time , he made me wait at the entrance in the car . &quot;
&quot; when he took me the second time , he commanded me to ascend . he led me to a barracks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible - stood . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small blan@@ ket wick@@ er and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great l@@ ump of silver . &quot;
this day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen objects were made and entertained me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are being tor@@ tured .
&quot; I se@@ wn in and saw a couch , being tor@@ tured on man . &quot;
she looked like a field @-@ bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person that was captiv@@ ated there .
&quot; she rarely took a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured out him with water and said him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the rock was there in it was f@@ oul ... like a dirty wind .
&quot; years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and me became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a man can do so much suffering from someone else ?
I knew that these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs , and bind them . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilians who was also indicted in the trial ) and I used the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people with the face down - all were captiv@@ ated by hands and feet .
near the entrance to the entrance to the mattresses .
&quot; when my father noted , that I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What would you do so , Ar@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
I &quot; &quot; cast &quot; &quot; Why did you otherwise bring me ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit and were killed and buried by soldiers .
&quot; I know this , because my father told me at home . &quot;
&quot; besides La cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero has collap@@ sed a man and killed .
&quot; ( according to survi@@ vor of the civilians , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indicted in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the head of the memorial La Per@@ la , through the former tor@@ ter@@ chambers . &quot;
&quot; the way you came in , is also the way on which the kidn@@ apping came here . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
here their names have changed and they were assigned as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of above came to be moved . &quot;
this was the lie - the Euph@@ em@@ ism - for the sho@@ ots of the people and the disappearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; War &apos; ute &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things with home .
then at the age of age I had no idea what the &apos; war@@ lords &apos; - as they called it - was .
&quot; but when I was later on the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that war beats a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military bases which one should combat an enemy that is fought . &quot;

&quot; but if one walks into a house and the fridge , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... silent , then this is not a battle ute but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I always wondered how my father , the head of security forces , was in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t understand it .
&quot; I was also officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house , and to ste@@ al everything in it . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand how my Father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I rep@@ lied , and you that thou go@@ wn on the street ? &quot;
you are not a crime ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded against anger , struck me and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you walk so far , then I will find you and take you selfish . &quot;
&quot; for this , we need no one else ! &quot;
that was my father .
I have no only good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the trial , I showed a photo of then on which I carried a jacket and a tur@@ k@@ pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father made of La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he also brought clothes with them . &quot;
&quot; back then I accused the defense of having a conspir@@ atorial in these crimes . I didn &apos;t resist , no problem , they can put me on the burden what they wanted . &quot;
I was anyway there to tell .
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appearances of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I find repentance . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if one only has children , one recognizes the value of a life . &quot;
one develops and recognizes that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you have ex@@ iled human beings during the dictatorship . but what the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why do children ent@@ ail ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl with her mother , whose mother was killed . &quot;
she was like our pet and almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
&quot; I asked myself again the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could just put it into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but what their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
did these people not also families who were able to commit their mortal remn@@ ants ?
the dis@@ appearances of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act that man can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was once again introduced , they took machines to eliminate the mortal remn@@ ants of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were ex@@ hor@@ ted and somewhere dis@@ car@@ ded - no idea where . &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something remains of course always .
&quot; I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even during the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
&quot; the thought , to indicate my father , was built during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot;
I made alleg@@ ations of all the atrocities that I had to experience .
&quot; then he said suddenly , &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed anybody . &quot;
&quot; I felt compassion for me and asked me why the entire exagger@@ ated patri@@ otic and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; , &quot; which supposedly defended them , actually were good . &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed men !
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me to participate as a child . &quot;
he only ref@@ uted &quot; Na then send me up .
that is what I did .
2010 I delivered the first ad .
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one can blame me that I am going to be . I finally said against my own Father . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the judg@@ ments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the span@@ ish order of the magnitude of judgment .
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera ended trial for crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August 1975 and December 1978 . &quot;
43 pres@@ sors were found guilty because of crimes against humanity and found guilty of life imprisonment in 28 cases and in nine cases a prison cell between 2 and 14 years . in six cases it was acqu@@ itt@@ able .

&quot; translation errors makes older people in Kyoto &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation errors in a center in Kyoto , where one can prolong its driving licence . &quot;
the photo was circul@@ ated in social media .
editing of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese town of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can prolong its driving licence , in the last month witnesses of a very special translation . &quot;
&quot; on a shield the Japanese word on the part of which the &quot; &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; means , mis@@ understand@@ ably - maybe also with arches thanks &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; as &quot; terrible drivers . &quot; &quot;
the false translation was on display in the entrance area from the 1st to 20th September in the entrance area and in the building itself .
the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine was often shared in the social media .
&quot; the mistake was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a citizen of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also , who pointed out the local time of local time . &quot;
the daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could it be such an English translation ? &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city as Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed first . the designation &quot; &quot; Young &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; fri@@ ghtful drivers ) was later replaced by the careful , though gram@@ mati@@ cally not completely correct term &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the Kyoto Protocol exc@@ used for the translation errors . furthermore , they explained that the error was already included in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not tested on its accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows on the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we are sorry that elderly people felt by insufficient correction ( translation ) in our part &quot; , &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News set out a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; fri@@ ghtful &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; terri@@ bly &quot; was denoun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents across accidents , but quite a cause for concern . &quot;
&quot; in Kyoto , for example , in 2005 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by seniors in the year 2005 . this corresponds to a percentage of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , Sen@@ iors 1,@@ 8@@ 03 of a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; in this way , its share rose to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of accidents in the same period has risen in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the specifically named re@@ porter brought comments on the Light published in the Yahoo published version of the article , which show which prejudices some Japanese seemingly against older drivers : &quot;
the article on Yahoo on the translation errors received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) not the reality ?
&quot; how does the translation actually do not , or ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t find that that is a real translator .
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so prevalent in the whole of Asia
translation errors are widely used in Japan and across Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true discovery for these bizarre errors in English .
photo of Flickr @-@ user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; for reasoning , one needs two important skills : passive language skills to understand the starting text and to commit active language skills to get it into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that is in the case with native speakers . in general , the conviction that translators are in the target language - should not be in the output language - native speakers . &quot;
&quot; thus , a French mother language should be translated from English into French , not from the French into English . &quot;
photo of Flickr users Karl Baron .
&quot; a large number of Japanese firms do not employ workers with English as a mother tongue , translation into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of the over@@ lay , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers , who are Japanese to learn . &quot;
&quot; some companies who do not have any foreign employees , nevertheless make use of fir@@ mer internally . then the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is considered to be the best - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;
photo of Flickr users Karl Baron .
machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the verb@@ s and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences , which are created by machine translation , show that this technology can &apos;t replace a human translator for a long time . this applies to some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints , often used T @-@ shirts or pockets , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;
photo of Flickr users Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable as jewellery still acceptable or at least harmless . however , by big companies or from the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards , one can expect more careful translation . &quot;
the city Kyoto is hopefully using a serious source for its translations in the future .
Venezuela : protest and cens@@ ored measures on the Internet and TV
&quot; main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , April 7th , Ber@@ ez@@ ol@@ rian internet users , that they had no access to the online radio station Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet pres@@ ences from V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV are no longer accessible . &quot;
other online channels also broadcast recordings of the protests in Car@@ acas that have been organised by op@@ positions that opposed the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
&quot; the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court was dissolved the parliament and transferred the parliament &apos;s responsibilities to the executive and the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is cli@@ pped , and recommended the users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet . &quot;
# cens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ elan providers are once again locked .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net page .
&quot; quotations like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Vene@@ tians , especially in times of unrest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been hesit@@ ant for 2014 during the reporting of protests . at that time , the Commission for telecommunications to them with monetary policy and lock@@ ers , if they continue to report on demonstrations as the Commission looked at this as a call to violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I signed up again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
surprising that this is still cheaper than to buy two lit@@ res of le@@ mon@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ IT filter confirmed later that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay through a block of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) is in@@ accessible , but also two other online transm@@ itter . this also affects the website , on which the National Assembly over@@ takes its meetings . &quot;
&quot; earlier research @-@ research of the Institute for press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that local internet suppliers want to use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS server requests of certain domains are flawless . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds or denied the request to the call of such website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ Fi@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v - @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
&quot; in V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transfer on Thursday , 6th of April , was set when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman Elvis Flor@@ es , who took the protests in Car@@ acas live in jail . &quot;
Flor@@ es has been beaten while he was at the police of police .
eight hours later he was released and V@@ PI@@ TV went back to show .
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multi @-@ media reporting on current events in the country ever more difficult . &quot;
in Paraguay a lot of girls get to slave in order to receive a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child a cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house in which she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina for the rights of children and g@@ athers testimonies of other cri@@ bs , who have been the victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report of Kurdish , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors . &quot;
&quot; this article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ elas , Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ ingers cows , exp@@ ir@@ ation schools &quot; ) , which is edited and published by Global Vo@@ ices of Latin America . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , in which they were not allowed together with the family who lived there . &quot;
&quot; shortly before their degree in the university , she returned to the house again and heard , as the owner of the house spoke full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; that , from which something has become , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she started to work as cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as cri@@ adi@@ tas , one called in Paraguay that is more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the store is quite simple : a large family with little money passes their under@@ age son or her minor daughter to another , richer family . in exchange the child receives food , training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned here is that the children cannot afford a countless days of home@@ work , which will never be paid and victim to abuse and abuse - and all that within the scope of a treaty which you can &apos;t lift . &quot;
these as cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice is widely used in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
&quot; after completing their studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization dedicated to the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
she talked to cri@@ adi@@ ta - especially young girls are affected by the practice of cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gathered witness and denoun@@ ced from the practice of crimes .
&quot; she tried to call things in the name , because the sense of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated in cri@@ adi@@ tas is guaranteed generally down@@ silent . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double del@@ usion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family who plays their daughter in the faith that they will complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who takes the girl with him and whose exploitation is justi@@ fying with faith that they would give someone a chance that would otherwise no education would receive , and perhaps even star@@ ving . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; if the girl is suspi@@ ci@@ ated , his family will only experience many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience it .
&quot; in January 2016 the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
when Carolina Mar@@ ín was born in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú in hospital showed her body traces of shar@@ per stro@@ kes . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as an official consultant for the resident .
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometres east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira spent as long as a stick on Mar@@ ín until they suffered fatal injury . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela took the deep @-@ rooted practice of cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they marked the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest and called for &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay are more cows than children registered , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to violate the rights of children un@@ punished . &quot;
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a rapid study on the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was to be sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case occurs before judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín will be pointing , if for the first time in the history of Paraguay , there is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go before judgment . &quot;
the daily life of a cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; cri@@ adi@@ tas will not only be exploited as man@@ power , they also live isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , where her father worked , she had to sign up and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; their brothers now had to go all working , and began to sell on the street or on the market for sweets , to make money . &quot;
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent as cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
&quot; in doing so , she had to split the time so that you still have time to learn . &quot;
she stood up at 5 p.m. and prepared breakfast for her employer .
&quot; for example , they puri@@ fied the fridge , p@@ utz@@ te the living room , polished the furniture and des@@ i@@ fied the floor . &quot;
when the school was finished she went home again and had time to learn .
&quot; the sooner she was finished with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employer .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says , she never had to go hungry , but did not get in@@ definitely . &quot; I could get more books from the library of the landlord than eating out of the refrigerator , &quot; she recalls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; to some evenings of the house@@ holder Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him and editorial from Op@@ position@@ ists like &quot; &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them to have no faith in the reports of the official media about the regime of dict@@ ator .
&quot; he certainly held her for intelligent , but not with her . &quot; the landlord had found someone who heard , while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they allowed me not often to visit my family because they had the opinion that I would learn there again &quot; bad habit &quot; . &quot; therefore , they assumed that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which belongs to the indigenous group of the Guaran@@ i to return home to their native Guaran@@ i . &quot;
&quot; their master feared that they had the formation , which they had made , again lose , explained . &quot;
&quot; it was completely clear , however , that they had been paid by them for everything they had paid by their hard work . &quot;
&quot; also in the school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a is discrimin@@ ated . &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken about , are Mob@@ bing and the Schi@@ kan@@ en , who are exposed to crimes when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , is a cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to my home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in time where friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly obvious that I was not part of a group . &quot;
&quot; the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;

draft law prescri@@ bes Egyptian users on social media to register at the government

published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian MPs recently voted in a draft law to &quot; the regulations regarding the use and utility of social networks . &quot;
&quot; when he is accepted by the Parliament , beneficiaries , and users of social media must register in Egypt at a governmental authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law then a position would be set up , which is meant to give citizens a permit to give citizens &apos; social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months , adopting the law would have to register commercial and users on the website of the site with their correct names and personnel numbers to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; will it be reconc@@ iled this to do so , this could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a w@@ bu@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; the bill that consists of six Par@@ ag@@ ra@@ fen and including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defined social media as &quot; every application , which is running and used over the Internet to communicate with others through voice , video content and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law is enforced when the draft does not assume any indication of how Egyptian authorities should be able to impose on the beneficiaries , that the Egyptian government is not currently able to ensure that the Egyptian government is currently unable to uph@@ old regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ du@@ l Satt@@ ar , Parliament members and promot@@ ers of the statutes , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered commercial drivers and users received a username and a password to get through the fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocks . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt is planning to judge a fire@@ wall on the national level around Facebook . because of which , it would be necessary for the Egyptians and Egyptians to reach information on their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known so far that such plans exist .
experts on site are skep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; executive research &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I strongly lack the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , it is so that just as they could easily control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take it seriously , then it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to request citizens who request permission or not . and that means a mad system to monitor the activities of men and also to bring them to a trial process . &quot;
this is by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the legislative and Constitutional committees before it goes into the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement shall be successful or not , the draft is consistent with a pro @-@ military thought in parliament , in whose sense it will be maxim@@ ised and safegu@@ ar@@ ded that there is no dis@@ so@@ fter Nar@@ ration on the screen . &quot;
&quot; last year , the parliament of the Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ ha@@ wy proposed a legal situation against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life @-@ long prison sentence for those destined to threaten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest . &quot; &quot;

high up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north @-@ east of the Iraqi region work the animal @-@ based H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq to protect the gh@@ ost Persian leop@@ ards .
&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of leop@@ ards , which strikes through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus Satt@@ x@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to po@@ der@@ ei , the loss and the frag@@ mentation of their habitat , as they always find less prey . &quot;
why is this particular type of leop@@ ards so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; the Persian leop@@ ard is the only remaining rob@@ bery in the Kurdish ecosystem , and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem depends also that a big rob@@ bery @-@ animal is present . &quot;
the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ards actually is small and goes against zero . when the team in the video is therefore determined that they have a recording of a big cat in the cam@@ af@@ all that breaks R@@ aza in pure joy .
&quot; as a trained bi@@ olog@@ in , R@@ aza passionate about a different side of their country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;
it has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs for Nature Iraq since six years .
it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to providing protection zones for wild animals in the Kurdistan region .

&quot; in early March 2017 , Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , which have been achieved for the northeast of Japan , Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress made during the last six years have been hit by the &quot; Three @-@ disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a huge earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered the disaster . &quot;
&quot; Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which is in the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a pre@@ fecture of Japan Nor@@ theast that had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were dec@@ eption because the ts@@ un@@ ami had won whole coastal cities from the map .
&quot; even more than that , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture , even alone , had to leave their homes for 160 000 inhabitants . &quot;
the special report of Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows the progress made six years by the local perspective to re @-@ establish the life of the local resident .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics from the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of those affected by themselves .
&quot; residential construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o Zeitung reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare houses ( or at the boot , ig@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the biggest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures managed by Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has finished 75 percent of such houses , whereas at Fu@@ kus@@ hima with 70 percent the closing light is light . &quot;
&quot; however , one still makes every effort to rec@@ eded also six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated of tourist @-@ accommodations ( on the part of the course , kas@@ et@@ su yu@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) to be settled in final spare houses . &quot;
after the triple catastrophe almost 80 000 people were forced to live in total @-@ time shel@@ ters .
&quot; in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such cases . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of the evac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 per cent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated that were destroyed after the disaster in the shel@@ ters , were settled in final houses . &quot;
for I@@ w@@ ate the number is here at 34 per cent .
the state of works and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fecture
&quot; as the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to find out 10@@ 74 from 1100 schools , who were affected by harm to December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; six years later , industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures is much more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while almost 100 per cent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i have now been in operation at Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 per cent of the fishing ports in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident occurred large in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agricultural land .
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of non @-@ destructive agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a result of an atomic bomb , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of non @-@ destructive agricultural land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are located in the &quot; nuclear zone &quot; zone . &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism has recovered and recovered to Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 percent at the same level , as in front of un@@ happiness . Fu@@ kus@@ hima cannot show here only 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reported that since the catastrophe almost half of the coast @-@ inhabitants , it seems more difficult to feel their living . &quot;
is the local population being prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to find a full picture , the newspaper led numerous surveys under the native population and under the ev@@ acu@@ ated through . she asked her about the state of re@@ building and also how her rebellion has changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk . &quot;
in the introduction of the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explained :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey through to bringing more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
&quot; the survey took that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures have taken to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those surve@@ yed are still not done enough in disasters . &quot;
how it stands for those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture
in her issue on the anniversary of the earthquake the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has also strengthened its attention on the position of the evac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima had to experience not only the huge earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness of the worst , disaster caused , atomic accident , Japan ever had to experience . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , almost 63 000 people were moved outside the pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; in early 2016 , a bit more than 23 000 people had been res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent spare houses . &quot;
&quot; after the date of 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants from Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside their home pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; in the astro@@ ph@@ ism areas , most of the ev@@ acu@@ ated areas are still older than 50 years old . they fail to return in proper accommodation , because the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects have to compete . this is projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo . &quot;
the World is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when one encounters people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences appear to be greater than the similarities . &quot;
after a while you often recognize that one connects more than it seems at first sight .
&quot; these global connections are important , since they challenge our prejudices , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this sequence of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we have a look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we treat topics that often get less attention in the coverage than they deserve . &quot;
&quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members , who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders . &quot;
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ ini has explained how the love of music has consolidated its affection to the Iranian culture ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time where she worked with people from all over the world ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was born this week in the intensive care unit : last Friday had taken him a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a stroke against the head . nationwide participated by prot@@ esters in a protest movement against austerity .
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated him on this Saturday and now have put it in an artificial communion .
his condition is deemed to be critical .
&quot; the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made pictures of the attack on Mat@@ eus , who quickly spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days . &quot;
&quot; on the pictures also the face of the police officer , who attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the Military Police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the conclusion of the investigation of an active ministry . &quot;
the images show the police officers as he suggests in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his stroke on the face of the students Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
&quot; if a police officer would th@@ ras@@ hed from a prot@@ esters and landing in the intensive care unit , his face would be six months on TV and all oppression would be justified by this . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video on the net , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edic shortly afterwards . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but from a different perspective filmed , is also visible in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another federal state , have now donated 10,000 Brasi@@ lia Re@@ ais ( approximately 2.@@ 700 Euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , while in the hospital . &quot;

&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás experienced a wave of political force : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish has been killed by his father , because he was killed by the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now we have attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who has been attacked by a poli@@ cem@@ an who has attacked him with a stroke . &quot;
police attacks
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only State in Brazil where it was the last Friday to brutal police protests against prot@@ esters .
&quot; poli@@ c@@ emen sat at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ator had built a stage for redund@@ ant , rubber and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , the police asked for speaker to ab@@ stain from violence against prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers around the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media are sl@@ ated by focusing on another , unexpected protagon@@ ists : a window of window . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported on a bl@@ ur@@ red glass window to be illustr@@ ative with a photo its front pages illustr@@ ative .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o is a title @-@ story using a brand set in fire . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window disc than about the protests of thousands who serve to defend a special cause . &quot;
&quot; this is necessary to recognize , if one is strictly against any form of atomic damage . &quot;
&quot; here , the term &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; maintains an absurd , dis@@ proportionate significance , and the typical violence of military police are protected by headlines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters in confron@@ tations of the police . &quot;
the villages of the kidn@@ induc@@ ing forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso we joined the doors almost hundreds of sugar factories in Cuba ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the municipality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of what there is no note@@ worthy sugar @-@ harvesting on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were laid in the sugar cane brands .
&quot; after freezing the sugar industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost gradually and according to its installations , until only the rum@@ or of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 2@@ 72 workers had to find themselves new .
some are rarely the work .
&quot; other res@@ ig@@ ni@@ es and com@@ mu@@ te daily to factories , which still gr@@ ind . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an that is open every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are su@@ gar@@ ment factories in the east of the region , having been in operation after a long in@@ active time because they have been preserved . &quot;
this was something he was not expecting .
N@@ ene reminds himself exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would get the sugar cane factory but the promise has not been kept .
&quot; the sugar state industry already contradic@@ ts the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market price , the in@@ efficiency , the poor administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , the production amoun@@ ted to 1,6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced quantity . &quot;
&quot; the news would have been a motive for alarm for the country a few decades , but the poor harv@@ ests are already no news . &quot;
why was the Cub@@ an sugar industry switched off ?
the old train parts of the church saw already better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 su@@ gars were technically outdated , and hardly competitive they became un@@ sustainable for the country . &quot;
the initial idea was to concentrate on production on the most efficient factories the annual production target amoun@@ ted to 4 million tons .
they only allowed the factories to produce the sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
&quot; the motives , which led to such measures , were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis in the world market . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price grew back around a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 until 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar has to stay between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 Report &quot; Land Economics &quot; of the OECD and FAO , the United Nations and Food Organization . &quot;
&quot; as current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3,@@ 6 million tons ) , the pipe @-@ export would be around 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go down in history , &quot; these were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the lac@@ tation of a total of 98 sugar ro@@ cking factories , over 65 million persons got their full sal@@ aries for further training . &quot;
the same happened in the su@@ gar@@ ro@@ hr@@ fabrik Greg@@ orio Arl@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ me on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez since 1967 in the factory .
&quot; if N@@ ene as he is known as a soldier regarding the closure of the factory , the word he is most repeated , &quot; fraud . &quot;
almost all those surve@@ yed are the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be tac@@ kled .
&quot; thus , the place is preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first closing year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially distributed documents , which would be removed only regarding the parts which would be removed , the addres@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ation Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister was able to undertake any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was transferred and the letters were ever more frequent . &quot;
Juan Carlos River@@ o was in charge for two years for the qu@@ aint factory and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still in operation . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years waiting for retirement in another facility , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was engaged against his will in the breastfeeding of the factory , in which he was helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important job producers has been eradic@@ ated .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for the employment and services that were generated in the municipalities where they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut speech of 21 October 2002 , the then president in the eyes of the present people saw , as he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of the su@@ gar@@ ment factories .
since 2004 the su@@ gar@@ cane is only extracted highly by the plant .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years , the municipality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane castle closed , or better than they began to dis@@ connect them , they also listened to the road to asp@@ hal@@ ting , this also disadvantaged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look up other factories . &quot;
they became part of spare parts .
&quot; without a perspective , many young people left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area a food factory was created , whose production not even serves to supply the church . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new system are still imposing .
&quot; late 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty up@@ take the old soldiers a pension of two thousand Pes@@ o per month to spend the years in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
&quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a thoughtful person , nevertheless he gives the lies that one told him not . &quot;
they tor@@ ment him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene exceeds 65 years in pension , not because it is lacking in force , but because it is bitter . &quot;

&quot; young people of the First Nations communities in all countries deal with issues that are important to them . they do so by Hi@@ p Hop , thanks to a number of traveling @-@ workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , mobile audio studios just launch schools and youth centres in 2014 to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hi@@ p Hop @-@ group The North@@ stars together . &quot;
&quot; the workshop will raise awareness of the young participants of talks such as &quot; &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self acceptance &quot; or whatever lies in mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First nation in British Columbia tells the story of the Highway 16 , also called &quot; highway of tears , &quot; at the almost two dozen young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to medi@@ ate how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences by globalization . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people did not always master the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation have recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
the young people involved did some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from North@@ stars Hi@@ p Hop group who gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in dialect James Bay Cre@@ e .
&quot; on the fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ site of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verses comes in trans@@ cript , as well as a translation into English , which is translated here into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel like wouldn &apos;t ever be interested in me
but I am trying to go on Earth for my days
this is the day when you take our cry .
because we have lost our way into life as youth
but I believe that one day we will rise up
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; in this way , they can grow and go ahead with our youth as well . &quot;
&quot; thus , they can do that which controls them to the Creator . &quot;
&quot; in the commentary volume , the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also adds a contribution and adds the rop@@ he in Sil@@ en@@ cap@@ es ( which will also be published on his blog ) : &quot;

in Japan they can be seen in front of almost any restaurant plastic dishes .
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , will be displayed close to the entrance sho@@ ok @-@ pur@@ u ( stretching out by the &quot; &quot; Plas@@ tic models of dishes &quot; &quot; ) of every food , which is served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers view these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the to@@ ki@@ er district K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there is a multitude of these small companies , which produce just those plastic dishes , docum@@ enting the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese they are plastic dishes so usually that they do not even notice them any more . however , a new trend is turned into show@@ y mobile accessories and other gadgets . &quot;
&quot; at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the Blog@@ ger shar@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist to sho@@ ok with sho@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; now on sale : new with plastic bags decorated mobile phones , as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kit@@ eline items , as in this case , cooling unit : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ oting cooling unit for a new exhibition in the Tokyo @-@ Station .
the new boom of ess@@ ences is becoming increasingly challenging .
in this case a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular travel shell with seafood ) turned into a cell @-@ handed .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile phones .
also this part we made for the exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple that keeps your phone fir@@ mer :
&quot; designed to see like an apple , with a candle for mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is only the beginning of an increasing approach to the com@@ ic .
&quot; some mobile phones and mobile phones allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a and laughter @-@ ro@@ gens are used , a popular suit , which is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; are there someone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now I can dis@@ appoint my mobile phone with laughter @-@ ro@@ gens ? &quot;
I believe I will probably be the one .
&quot; this interest in plastic waste may also take a less appe@@ tizing shape , to surprise his example colleagues or family members unpleasant . &quot;
our newest mobile phone rings has the form of mel@@ tdown .
&quot; in addition , there are also travel balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and wr@@ aps from dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; more sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter using the h@@ ash@@ tag # at the boot of , &quot;
&quot; if you would like to know more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi quarter , dedicated to the Bel@@ ie@@ fer@@ ing of the restaurant industry . for example , with the sho@@ ok @-@ pur@@ u . &quot;

a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports of foreign and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ hes and dec@@ eased regularly emerge only in statistics . however , these reflect not the extent of the human tragedy which brings that struggle with itself . &quot;
&quot; the report about drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , head of the Sin@@ hal@@ a @-@ Kart@@ ell , sup@@ planted the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looking at the trau@@ mas or on the communities who have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; we stand behind every cor@@ pse , behind every bone @-@ report in the hundreds of hidden graves , the stories of loose parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds will never heal . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico launched the digital project &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; with drug trafficking , &quot; ) to give these victims a voice and telling stories about people who were united in the fight between law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organised crime cannot only be afraid of our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
&quot; for example , when doing business , because they are threatened by drug dealers , and whole communities should have to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk . &quot;
the ache of the victims
a video titled &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ per@@ p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; as fear life changed &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who was wi@@ ped the secret tombs after his son every weekend . &quot;
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who in only one day lost their father , her four si@@ blings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew . &quot;
&quot; a priest : &quot; like every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task that we have placed ourselves , go and go to graves , to the people we loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 . when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he was supposed to be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me too . &quot;
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; you are at the assurance of my father , but who does not pay her off because that demand a mort@@ gage deed . &quot;
where should we get it ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con &quot; Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we don &apos;t just have to show the faces of those who are afraid of fear . we have to show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a les@@ bian of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that violence should never look at normal , regardless of what form it occurs : &quot;
I &apos;ve been familiar with disease and Sens@@ ational journalism for several years now .
I come by newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and I see the front pages with images that actually only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I feel as if I am the only , who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it acts as a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body . &quot;
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
it writes on :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin will think he wants Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if he is great . and it &apos;s also not normal that people listen to songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me it is as if they have lost those who have lost someone , and those who fear that they may have something like that . &quot;
I see our weakness if stories are to be mere numbers in a statistics .
&quot; the in@@ som@@ nia of the people is incredibly responsible for me , if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbor should be justified by the fact that they were &quot; s@@ äs@@ sig . &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to persu@@ ade that they are spar@@ ed by such trage@@ dies when they are not stir@@ ring and silent .
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the capital district . in this , it describes how the armed crime month was tor@@ mented by their business until they ended up not only the business , but also their family apart . &quot;
&quot; you think of everything you have lost , and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days . &quot;
&quot; the ache beyond never passes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes again high when you are alone . &quot;
habits have changed and phone numbers .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the more we are removed from each other , the better . &quot;
they included their report in the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , as one does not know when they will guide or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days if crying out my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answers is no , because I forgot how to live cri@@ es . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the post &quot; For@@ gotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : one of violence recorded by force .
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions on how : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a guard and he tells that he himself needed to teach himself how to cook a egg , potatoes , tor@@ tillas warm , and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies to live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the vial of water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
&quot; but they are insignificant , compared to the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy who consists of violence and had to learn to live with it . &quot;
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood has been past two years earlier , when he only saw a few blocks from his home , the bloody body of his father saw , who was shot by armed men out of a squ@@ ad car . &quot;
as Br@@ yan was born the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murder on public security and government of the United States Government . &quot;
alone in 2010 the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s Office 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the cut 8.@@ 5 Mor@@ den per day .
these are just some of the hundreds of thousands of thousands who leaves the organized crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade the soul into the soul of the country .
but few stories are living on the face of ever new headlines . but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico 2015 has launched the Dat@@ at@@ n@@ alism @-@ project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim consists of portra@@ ying the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking , which has been tor@@ mented over the country in the last four decades . &quot;
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flickr user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) warning : this entry and the pages to which he linked , include pictures on which violence is represented . &quot;
&quot; the fact check is important in a moment , in which it is about to raise a rum@@ or or fal@@ si@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; but how is the years after something has emerged ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to persist . &quot;
let us take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
&quot; since its first release , it was mis@@ led to use trage@@ dies which have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false copy of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in terminology by Global Vo@@ ices or First D@@ raft News - does not deny the fact that there are abundant careful coverage of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it also raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a petrol station crossed the place San@@ ge in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te and explo@@ ded . here , 230 people came to live . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa was a second largest country for years and became desol@@ ated . roads in the region have become dangerous paths of stri@@ ps , which were difficult to drive . &quot;
a tra@@ gically happened to the victim of the petrol trucks .
&quot; administration representatives described a fire@@ ball , the incub@@ ating houses included , including a cinemas in the vicinity , which was full of people who vivid the soccer championship . &quot;
houses crum@@ bs and wi@@ pl@@ ated cor@@ p@@ ses scattered in the streets scattered .
many people were burned to the consistency .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur User My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 2015.@@ Mehr@@ ere photos of the incident form the gru@@ es@@ ome scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of stolen bodies that are str@@ anded on the ground while individuals look at it .
but here history is not its end .
&quot; over the years , the same photo was applied several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and mistak@@ enly did not apply to the trage@@ dies , especially in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened to Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 the B@@ oko Har@@ am fighters were picked up at the remote villages of B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
eyes reported dramatically from atrocities on which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and cor@@ rupted in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; the numbers could not be confirmed but no one stayed back to count bodies , &quot; said one citizen to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
many were disper@@ sed , shot or burned . &quot;
only on the basis of satellite images could be presented the following time .
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army point in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military of Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt at B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the picture from the Democratic Republic of the Congo come again as proof of the fact and the potential extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris . &quot;
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this abu@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of failure ; Africa Check has been documents to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all of these cases , the picture was presented as a test@@ ament to mass@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; one step further bring personal comments like this , understand@@ ably the image from the Democratic Republic of the Congo is related to sources of mass media in connection to arguments . &quot;
the picture from San@@ ge appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a studio , published by the United Nations , those who could flee , rape and a few t@@ ote , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported from violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts were reported like the following , who made these descriptions together with photographs from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture was taken from a Saudi news page , which in 2012 was mis@@ leading , the President of the mar@@ s Th@@ ein Sein I said , monks and politicians had participated in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she used the picture from the DR Congo to translate this information . &quot;
&quot; the original fee , which was finally accessed last on 26 April 2017 , can be called up here . &quot;
&quot; other syndic@@ ate organisations , AF@@ P as their source , were also mistak@@ enly called Th@@ ein of this statement , but did not have the image taken from the Democratic Republic of the Congo . &quot;
the global reach of false information
traces of these false coupling cuts down to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from anywhere around the world .
using a &quot; reverse image search &quot; you can see how far more information can be crossed .
&quot; a revers@@ ed picture search with the search engine ink Eye has found at 18.@@ 8 billion images ( status of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the said picture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixing mas@@ ch of private pages , platforms of social media and Community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
some have passed both false reports and have tried others to expos@@ ing counterf@@ eit@@ ing .
&quot; we have limited examples of the abu@@ sive use and brought them into connection with the respective countries , based on which side they were published . thus , we want to show the range more clearly than by the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which in some cases were also linked with each other ) , several examples of abu@@ sive use can be used . &quot;
here some cases which can now be fully split up ( on the map in orange ) :
map : news Fr@@ ames .
country exemp@@ tion from false cou@@ pl@@ ings of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
&quot; the orange ranges point to pages or servers , through the examples of counterf@@ eit@@ ing or mis@@ hes are still available . &quot;
&quot; the countries in Gray are examples , which are available to the met@@ adata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also counterf@@ eit@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma @-@ Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image of the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum post ( directed at Algeri@@ an and interested Arabs ) as part of an thread to the &quot; war of Buddh@@ ists against Muslims . &quot;

&quot; in this post a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City would not only be mis@@ directed , but also discussed the abuse of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the individuals and of the affected trage@@ dies ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) . &quot;

&quot; even within Nigeria , the photo was divided from the DR Congo as a proof for the bom@@ b@@ ings of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion research . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme examples of a mis@@ used use of the picture from the DR Congo , with a twe@@ et , sympathy against the Nig@@ erian massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the asser@@ tions , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are per@@ secuted , since the photos of it were mis@@ used . &quot;
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; the Myanmar government released a job creation that it &apos;s presented as &quot; inten@@ tionally Finnish news and photos , international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ concep@@ tions regarding Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; these str@@ aps which appeared exclusively in English also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ours , the H@@ ate Spe@@ ech run , and used by extrem@@ ist groups to present that Muslims Buddh@@ ists kill and the other rum ( which is often circul@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;

&quot; this post , which directed itself to the members of the Russian @-@ orthodox community , clari@@ fies that the image of the DR Congo is not showing Muslims to kill the Christians . &quot;
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this news page asser@@ ted that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein Sein and confirmed that monks and politicians participated in the kill@@ ings of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought the story with the image of San@@ ge . &quot;
&quot; the article was updated in 2014 , and at the time of this publication the picture is still included in it . &quot;
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 &quot;
&quot; this article of 2014 over students , which had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic @-@ standing news page An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has explicitly stated that the picture was not drawn from the kill@@ ings but it claims that it &apos;s a &quot; &quot; similar way &quot; &quot; attack . &quot;
&quot; as the picture later in connection with the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to resist that there were links to Nigeria . &quot;
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ a@@ Yan@@ u@@ y@@ or@@ th@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ yu@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns to the world ) .
&quot; the picture of the DR Congo appeared , with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and solve a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the proposal on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities took part in the name of Islam , a greater attention . &quot;
&quot; States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was danced as a test@@ ament to the &quot; &quot; B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 &quot; &quot; massacre . but the messages that were associated with it were found in no religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the target was to attract attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media reporting , compared to Nigeria and attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message which was supposed to be written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ erian massacre , put it in circulation like this here on Vietnamese and declared it to be false . &quot;
&quot; from the embassy in which the image was contained in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ inians Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; other confirmed examples of a faul@@ ty use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the cap in grey ) also points to the Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
&quot; ( data entry with URLs and time @-@ date stamp exist on the web cra@@ w@@ ler and unified , in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . ) &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original article of 2010 , the picture ultimately bears a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or appro@@ achable . &quot;
frames and images
&quot; there are two strong topics or frames ( frames ) that go through these Po@@ sts , the first Fr@@ ame is focused on religion . &quot;
the photo was used in terms of larger discussions about the silence in connection with the presence of Christians through Muslims or - to the defence of Muslims - the inv@@ oc@@ ations of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Buddh@@ ists .
a second fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how a African life is being evaluated compared to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is both important , so it is worth to examine how pictures are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; a deeper question is , however , what happens when readers cannot give this pictures longer faith . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are some people who have un@@ intended to share the water around a tragedy . &quot;

the spread of rap@@ ed pictures has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( here for example ) .
an argument is that the re@@ taining of pictures of an ref@@ usal to acknowledge the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
&quot; at the same time , the concern that non @-@ violent images can sensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and audience and feel the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( for example , this study , the analysed , how violent media have to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there are quite a lot to discuss about the news media in the news media , it is fact that it is indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists experiment , because with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . they will thoroughly think about the situation in which a picture suggests something that is , however , from context or completely mis@@ used nature . &quot;
&quot; however , any investigation of false grants should also be considered as international as they can be . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqueness of smaller languages
photo of Andy Sim@@ mons in accordance with CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog named Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. non @-@ practic@@ able ) strives to offer voice enthusiastic a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words are available in any language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these uns@@ ur@@ inary words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese aci@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( such as the Spanish Bre@@ bre@@ m@@ esa ) .
but they are all stub@@ born stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; one word or expression is not sufficient , why a complete explanation and sometimes somewhat context is required to precisely understand what is meant by this a word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese , or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist decided by &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the M@@ w@@ ot@@ ech language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , as : &quot;
v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k - Will Be your parents in recognition of how they endeav@@ ours to have endeav@@ ored to you in your recent years .
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil , as : &quot;
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or sl@@ oth , which one feels after getting cold on cold days in the sun . &quot;
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog About :
&quot; they determined other cultures , reveal other thought of thought and aw@@ aken our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you will affect how we analyse and classi@@ fy the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; , &quot; which are appreciated by in@@ sol@@ lat@@ able are invited to invite their favorite sw@@ ings here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst Fl@@ ut@@ kat@@ disaster of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst high @-@ water and lands@@ li@@ ble disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which in the end of May comes to the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country over the banks . &quot;
&quot; following the opinion of the disaster centre of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundred people were missing because of the flight and mud . &quot;
&quot; more than 400 000 people have been affected by last Friday ( 26 May ) , and approximately 100 000 people were brought to 30@@ 4 safe destinations . &quot;
&quot; the rainf@@ alls were left on Saturday ( 27th May ) , and the waterfalls in some areas were slow . &quot;
health and health insur@@ ances of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected areas affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos give an impression of the extent of the disaster disaster :
flood water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water states of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of the disaster .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly fluid wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue crisis , warning save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on the way . &quot;
&quot; today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus stood in the flood , water standing up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da at G@@ alle are also flooded because of the present water @-@ shortage of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Air Force has five planes for li@@ f@@ ebo@@ ards , and another five will be finished in the transport of not@@ ated villages for the residents in their flooded villages . &quot;
also various organizations and star@@ tu@@ ps have prepared themselves to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ safely in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on the flood situation and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and li@@ f@@ ebo@@ arding dr@@ ones need for their operations , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and vital goods for high @-@ water @-@ offering -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
&quot; please call today the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 84@@ 38@@ 41 when they need help in this area . &quot;
&quot; the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their sit@@ ing data with the help of the app , so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum is informed . &quot;
&quot; last year after the catastrophe of the Tro@@ pen@@ crash Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ me led a &quot; &quot; flood relief &quot; &quot; button which allowed the users to call a vehicle for pick@@ up assistance and donations . these were then forwarded to the Sri Lan@@ kan Red Cross . &quot;
&quot; they also led a &quot; &quot; S@@ OS &quot; &quot; button which had more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat transactions for the result of floo@@ ding , and lands@@ li@@ des . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts by the Government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exhausted , residents of need bring certainty and do help . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot;
Muslims - which you cannot see
the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ ha@@ zi .
use Re@@ ig@@ .@@ Dam@@ as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor in and love girlfriend .
&quot; I trust her my four year old daughter , she trusted me her children , she is my rock in the br@@ anding . &quot;
in the one minute we call for slo@@ gans for the rights of women .
&quot; in the next , we are entitled to transfer rights to transc@@ ending . &quot;
&quot; we are located in a sea of rain@@ forest and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with a head @-@ hand high , bound out of an American flag , other sk@@ il@@ ly slo@@ gans against Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; me and my girlfriend look at me and says : &quot; &quot; these things do not affect you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Mus@@ lim@@ a ? &quot; , &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already conducted this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their conception . &quot;
you discour@@ aged me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not all look straight away .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different kinds . but somehow we shall all put all into the same Muslim dra@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; this dra@@ wer is so well designed in our collective imagination so as soon as Muslims , who like I not fit in there . &quot;
to be du@@ li@@ zed
I am not alone with it alone .
&quot; this even has happened to the poet , whose poetry is best sold in America : Rum@@ i . &quot;
&quot; what images do you come to a sense of mind , if you think of it ? &quot;
love ?
peace ?
when J@@ al@@ alu@@ dd@@ in Rum@@ i was as old as I am now he was a Orthodox pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
&quot; Islam , the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western conception the religion was removed from Rum@@ is , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a great part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
&quot; another consists of the reduced images of Muslims , the Western books have already been de@@ crimin@@ alized for centuries . &quot;
&quot; this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man , whom you ought to fear and the exotic woman you should save . &quot;
the groundbreaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid was cut down the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these images still prot@@ rude .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to act . &quot;
&quot; I worked for three years in the news industry for thirteen years , and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty Nar@@ r@@ atives dominate our News@@ fe@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; this fo@@ d@@ v over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed the reality in the last three decades , nine Muslim women could not even choose their first female presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; this s@@ rati@@ v failed to acknowledge that if French , Muslim women are prevented from carrying their head@@ ache in public buildings and forced Saudi women by their government to cover their entire body that these are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group exercises his &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; to the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this powerful fo@@ d@@ v weak@@ ens Muslim women , which lead movements for change . &quot;
it looks over that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil of Afri@@ cans who were so meanwhile brought with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v has occupied our collective imagination such as deep and faul@@ ty that often Si@@ kh men and children become the goal of tim@@ ately attacks and ra@@ ils .
&quot; because of these stories , which we tell and because of the way we tell them is Islam@@ ophobia today not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to the 1,7 billion promises
in the news industry we are doing more than just telling stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
&quot; we are also creating Nar@@ r@@ ative , who help us understand the world . &quot;
and my industry has failed to grasp the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1.7 billion .
and we have failed here where seven million Muslims constitute the highest degree of &quot; various &quot; religious group in America .
more than one third of the total Muslim population are African American people .
&quot; six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation , coming from 77 countries . &quot;
the parents of the author in 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago my first emigr@@ ated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother placed her first jewelry designer on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in skyscrapers from New York ; skyscrapers were made possible by Muslim , American st@@ atics of Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; back then , when Khan was re@@ formed the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were undeni@@ able Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now just f@@ aded a Muslim and American ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t want to recover s@@ wine , I say - instead of bringing my Muslim recipes or to pick my hand@@ some pocket , all Muslims bear in mind - &quot; from respect to Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I jo@@ kes , we do not wear all the pocket cor@@ ds with us . &quot;
&quot; we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; or to be selected at almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot;
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who seek to fight widespread lies of Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the ongoing volume of a well @-@ called Islam@@ ist anti @-@ cultural heritage with pur@@ ses , Thin@@ k tanks and experts for mis@@ information which is our already faul@@ ty image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories that we have been telling and about the way we tell them , Islam@@ ism is more than just a stranger , who under@@ mines the head @-@ to@@ wel . &quot;
&quot; or as the start@@ ling map of attacks on mos@@ ques all over the USA , see below . &quot;
scre@@ enshot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
Islam hos@@ tility in its ugly forms is attacking our belonging .
&quot; it handles our identity , which is so far @-@ wide , so versatile and multi @-@ fac@@ eted that it can be impossible to fit into a dra@@ wer . &quot;

I want to explain this .
&quot; I was born as Mus@@ lim@@ a , but was born to be a Muslim , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; if social scientist describe religious life , they attack the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my mus@@ li@@ ous faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neighbor , my neighbour , my Rock in the Brand@@ ing see that I am Mus@@ lim@@ a when she could look through the 15 meter concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
she would see the ni@@ ghtly ritual with my daughter when I walk in my arms and her the Arab verses for protection to protect the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that they are protected from evil , the wicked one you can see and the evil one can &apos;t see . &quot;
&quot; my mus@@ li@@ ous faith is not always visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow . &quot;

&quot; belonging to my Grand@@ mother &apos;s picture is the picture of my Grand@@ mother &apos;s mother with her sisters , as she won a contest of organizing the art of flowers in Kar@@ achi bands . &quot;
&quot; it is the image of her that I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by its ful@@ ler and unfinished paintings by many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and fourteen chapters , which can practically be agile . &quot;
&quot; being Mus@@ lim@@ a means to speak the prayers , which she told me to speak if I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; H@@ lim@@ a is to be as she taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that was founded over centuries - by a &quot; Imperi@@ um &quot; , &quot; which has founded a company with the name of Ven@@ erable British Eastern European company , it has a deep meaning to call my only Lord . &quot;
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
&quot; belonging that means to grow and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time seeing that my grandfather &apos;s grandfather are crying . &quot;
&quot; in the middle , while he writes books about modern Islam and about the independence of Kas@@ h@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana J@@ aan was not f@@ aded to close his family in India who were not allowed to close his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians , their families , like with my grandfather , of coloni@@ alists , who have shared the Muslim world as at stake . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans all have become &quot; &quot; coloni@@ alist &quot; &quot; to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was rejected in front of a Muslim country .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an intimate , Kas@@ h@@ mir@@ ischer subj@@ ection of the British empire , was described by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous , &quot; as he was the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; even before it was air@@ planes he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever had , and preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billions goes deep into our unforgettable family rooms ; our uns@@ ab@@ ed history .
&quot; it means remembering that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops , which were over every continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , distributed in Iraq to chase weapons of mass destruction , which did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half an hour of Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of the war .
an American Mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that the self @-@ murder among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that if a tragedy comes home , and the susp@@ ects bears a Muslim name , the story takes four times more than a story with a white attack . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that four hundred years ago , the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slaves with the name Bil@@ al . &quot;
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought into this country .
it means called Mal@@ col@@ m X to name an American hero .
&quot; it is the warmth , which I sen@@ sing to fight the airports in order to fight against the Muslim B@@ an . &quot;
&quot; it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams , and when we say black life . &quot;
&quot; to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a Kas@@ h@@ mir@@ i , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist , the in@@ dur@@ ente inter@@ c@@ tion@@ ality of our with multi @-@ scale identities , but to fail to communicate it to others . &quot;
&quot; the fo@@ d@@ v of 1.7 billions holds more possibilities than a magic cub@@ es , but is represented in the reducing ambig@@ u@@ ity &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother , to care for my child and all Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that powerful and privileged people can be established on this doub@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ ism exists in the Muslim registr@@ atures , which began with President Bush and extended to President Obama . &quot;
it is made in a consistent surveillance of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it consists in the immigration officer , who occupies a five year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders towards people from just the countries that are being bombar@@ ded .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; which largely Arabs and Muslims share in the field .
these are the wars that we lead and the bombs which we reject on Muslim countries .
&quot; because of the stories that we tell and because of those we are not telling , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study involving the title A@@ scent of Man , scientists from North@@ western University showed a scientific correct image and data to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 with regard to evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the sligh@@ test score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations which we must lead
&quot; we are too deeply dar@@ ling , to transform the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
we are decades back to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous prints that we process in our news editorial campaigns .
&quot; at least , there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which tries to capture our frequently used identities and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the Pod@@ cast See something , S@@ ay something from Bu@@ zz@@ ling ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ Muslim &#93; Secret of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square via black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , multip@@ ly Muslim writers , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot;

col@@ lage of the author .
&quot; but I am worried about this difficult global point , in which we are . &quot;
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1,7 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; there is one reason that conspir@@ ators , which exist in the dark corners of the internet , now the White House . &quot;
they have grown expon@@ entially because they have Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ entially , by created the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , it had not yet been given ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m concerned about the realities and the history of which I was not aware of , as I was as old now , as it is my daughter , but who today did it to be a unavoidable Mus@@ lim@@ a . &quot;
things I left here like a ro@@ ot@@ ch track in my speech .
&quot; things that may aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that constitutes our humanity , may be a story that one is made to another . &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , we will take place in the context of the 8th annual conference on Islam@@ ophobia . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred academ@@ ics speak about our problems with the &quot; &quot; other &quot; , &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , these are no terms with which we usually throw in our schools for us or which we read in our newspapers . &quot;
poster the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ site of the Islamic Studies Network .
we all need to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell you here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are led and people gathered by the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; in the public presentation , four decades himself being the science of Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we need to ask ourselves un@@ convenient questions about the role of being aware and consciously &quot; &quot; consolidate the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; because the employment is that we have no president in which we have already broken countries and &quot; &quot; to other &quot; &quot; humans bom@@ bed , far beyond the visible and invisible 1,7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narr@@ atives wants to preserve urban diversity
&quot; tell stories , from Flickr and Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a possibility to connect here and now despite a language barrier to someone ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the telling of stories in their original language is possible answer . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird , the Un@@ removable Blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not in the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of major cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already performed events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed to the children born there . &quot;
for the creators of the project apply :
&quot; the man@@ nequ@@ ins of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that must not forget diversity , safe spaces where residents do not have to forget who they are . &quot;
&quot; while &quot; listen often with it is connected to understand &quot; &quot; for purposes these events instead , &quot; &quot; listen to , to feel , to feel . &quot;
&quot; in this format , the story t@@ ellers represent their story in their own language before and translate or explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even though the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , so carry out their devotion and their presentation to allow the list@@ ener to it . &quot;
they call themselves laughter and emotions than the language no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows for example a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language d@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou can also explain the opportunity to explain the typical customs of the narr@@ atives . &quot;
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the f@@ able of the rab@@ bit and the b@@ abo@@ an in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; having explained the meaning of his tale , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a broad smile , he shares his sense of inclu@@ siveness : &quot;
you have listened to !
you were attentive ...
they were quite with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities and the organis@@ ers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS into contact with T@@ LS . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for new debt &apos; debts by the US
&quot; with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took up to 72 million US dollars , took part in the capital city of the capital , on April 3 , 2017 , the government building of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an . &quot;
&quot; called by the group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( European Front for the ne@@ ural examination of the debts ) and the O@@ kom@@ en@@ ical Church of Puerto Ri@@ cos . &quot;
the inter@@ c@@ essors of the re @-@ determination of debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos urges that politicians , ban@@ kers and government agencies responsible for debts , are responsible for their corrupt to responsibility . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial examination and a guidance committee without personal interest in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions and remuner@@ ation , which is in favour of the economy . &quot;
we will be pressed and oppressed .
&quot; the people Puerto Ri@@ cos refuse to pay a debt , which is not its . &quot;
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be available with decl@@ ining payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not in the territory of the integrated territory of the USA - is suffering from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; is a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization without party membership with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law for government responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state of government . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; the measures imposed from the outside shall be at risk without the participation and conviction of citizens , to be rejected by the people . &quot;
&quot; the demonstration carried the name &quot; &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture that is organized in Berlin , dedicated to an event of # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , chair@@ ing books made within three to five days , las@@ en extracts from the Book of Freedom : A Collec@@ tive In@@ ins ( The cost of freedom : a collective re@@ research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was released last year and is available here license free , contains a number of approaches that deal with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
&quot; this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built , and what the real cost is , with which this is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , developers , researchers and authors who have worked on the movements for free knowledge have worked on page to be informed about the fog , which surrounds our news@@ fe@@ eds and to create some sense from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , beloved and celebrated internet volunteers , who has been de@@ tained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was painted out of the directory of the A@@ dra @-@ prison , in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have no information on its current state or residence . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that pushing for his release , and want to know him back in its normal life and freedom . &quot;
&quot; seeing how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture , many of us begin to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what have we chosen ?
what have we given up in this process of tempor@@ al extreme convic@@ tions ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in prison by Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and Ombud@@ sper@@ son N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military poli@@ c@@ ei Bas@@ sel reported on the basis of a &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; command of the military tribunal of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi told that she was contacted on 12 November 2015 by people who presented themselves as in@@ sider of the Assad government and took note of a alleged death part against her husband .
&quot; however , its location and condition remain unknown . &quot;
&quot; a leading Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role in extending access to the internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Techn@@ ologist and currently transmitted the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps none of the bas@@ ing cultural prototypes fores@@ ees as the work , which he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross @-@ crossing of numerous civilizations and here merge Greek @-@ Roman architectural types with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; bas@@ sel could not yet know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put it all about it , this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this strip @-@ train into the digital arche@@ ology and conservation has created a time @-@ capsule , which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , Bas@@ sel has not yet been able to complete this project . &quot;
&quot; N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I have spent my entire life with it , dream of freedom and I taught me to embrace it . &quot;
I am overwhelmed when I call his name .
Bas@@ le brought me English even when he was in custody .
I learned to read English well and speak English .
he has always shared his knowledge with each one who has asked . he has taught other inscri@@ ptions taught English to write and speak English .
Bas@@ le opened me the door to technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he has also taught other prisoners as they use computers , at least theoretically , without having actually kept one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a Pro@@ sab@@ bath , which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband , when he was in custody . &quot;
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura worked together in the book for a long time .
she put the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from the Arabic .
the book is license @-@ free .
book@@ store by Youssef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here &apos;s an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening :
it is done by every visit ;
&quot; that I sink in the world of your enchanting sight , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the contempl@@ ation in the moment we embrace , &quot;
that any of the dangers doesn &apos;t matter ?
&quot; of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guardian &quot;
I forget the cr@@ ush of prison
and I went into every detail of your voice and words
whom I carry with passion for me
when your eyes are living well
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; back quickly to my lon@@ eliness , &quot;
to recover all the moments
and through your absence to we@@ ep and smile .
I persu@@ aded myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bas@@ sel wrote G@@ ha@@ zi :
&quot; a year passes , my soul &quot;
during the time
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage with Monster
bas@@ ing story is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests against the Bashar al @-@ Assad regime , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared . &quot;
&quot; those who were arrested or van@@ ished by the regime by the regime , were tor@@ tured or even executed . &quot;
&quot; since 2011 , Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in jail for 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other people are unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bas@@ sel for 2012 .
&quot; today , we repeat our demand in the hope that we have to do so for the last time . &quot;
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : due to corruption judgment calls for release from prison on forec@@ ast@@ ed posts
&quot; Mos@@ ambi@@ an re@@ acted to a cor@@ rup@@ ture with anger , in which a government @-@ member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus , in which the corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is the Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other def@@ endants in 2010 ( approximately 800 000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds from Moz@@ ambi@@ que , whose advice Cam@@ ba@@ za was between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released for good guidance in 2016 , and immediately requested his return to the company , which happened on April 19 then . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with an opinion of the General @-@ State Office of the Republic , which exp@@ elled the application , there would be no barriers to Cam@@ ba@@ za , again to its old post , since the company was not a discipl@@ in@@ arity according to his custody . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not need the action good . &quot;
&quot; the Center for Public integrity ( Centro de Integr@@ ated da@@ de P@@ ú@@ blica , shortly C@@ IP ) , is a local institution , committed to public transparency , condemned the decision of the company to re @-@ establish the director again in an interview with the Deutsche Welle : &quot;
&quot; in the fight against corruption , it represents the lack of transparency and is even a back@@ step in terms of the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we have to know is that the company should have a discipl@@ in@@ arity in opposition to the res@@ eller .
&quot; however , the company apparently apparently l@@ apped and prompted no proper legal action to apply the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ ente social media , re@@ jects this behavior as well and considers the case to be &quot; black@@ ness &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent type , it would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and which half of them had gone . &quot;
&quot; he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could consult and read his image . &quot;
&quot; but since it is in@@ competent , he has authorized to become re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to cause damage . &quot;
consequently it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is happy to pay for his silence .
resistant !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ ague , young Mos@@ ambi@@ an and student of political science in Brazil , says the director no morality : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he ins@@ ult it , I can not believe that one has been rewarded someone in such a way that the state has already suffered as massive . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks morality and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead it serves only the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as a guide to an in@@ exhaus@@ tible money source , and the state itself has become tired , who has been rel@@ o@@ aded and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remind you that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; th@@ iev@@ es belong in the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , the Moz@@ ambi@@ ans not only remain in memory for ever @-@ independent President , but also as a sharp , cutting and - next door - prophe@@ tical speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral representations was , when he was energetic , that &quot; an ambitious human being capable of everything , even the father@@ land for its ambitions , his own individual interest , for sale . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tactics , but it does not change from its ambitions . &quot;
an ambitious man is simultaneously criminal . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also down@@ gra@@ zing :
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat down 10 years and came free . &quot;
&quot; and today it sets up the company in which he mon@@ ies money back , returned under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ λ@@ ε@@ ί@@ ν ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12th May 2017 &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; means Ki@@ cher@@ vil or spinal b@@ se .

&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their po@@ sts out of the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word still is being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people ost@@ indi@@ an origins or generally use as an ad@@ j@@ ective . &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; spinning &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; on the part of &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese writing ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
in recent years the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements of the word has given an extremely ab@@ ov@@ able con@@ notation .
&quot; specifically , it is a word that most often uses ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful contents on its platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar &apos;s might not be associated with racism today , but the word itself is not calling non @-@ hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; many people have reported that also Po@@ sts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed to their use . &quot;
&quot; furthermore there are several bur@@ ial words with the different meanings , which have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair on Bur@@ m@@ ese also written &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ er A@@ ung Kad@@ ung My@@ at explained the different meanings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a mail to one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he had asked his friends in a spiritual way whether he knew how to rel@@ ieve his back pain by making a word of words . &quot;
&quot; the set ku la - &quot; &quot; healing &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the fra@@ gment ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; in Win is the opinion that they will reduce hate speech , radical national ists , also emphas@@ ised that Facebook must be analy@@ tic before it can spread all Po@@ sts that may spread in suspicion against racism . &quot;
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm is not understood what you write on Fac@@ ent@@ ook .
&quot; what it should instead , is the post to analyze carefully and control it by checking the next words . &quot;
&quot; for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the good is that these three @-@ legged nation@@ alists spread , spread a rather good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to cut their nationalism .
&quot; while the promotion may send a strong signal to everyone , dissemin@@ ating hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy will not stop long . &quot;
&quot; the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat is proved that the cens@@ orship of keywords often becomes a k@@ atz@@ - and mouse game , whereby users use social networks simply to use a new word or write an alternative spelling of the word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author of A@@ ung Kad@@ ung My@@ at described , as Facebook , began to clear his po@@ sts , as he wanted to communicate his friends only that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; from the social network is ban@@ ished : &quot;
&quot; when I became aware of this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook and was forbidden by the Li@@ ves , posts and parts of content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; &quot; Facebook community standards not dis@@ missed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of po@@ sts of people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against hate speech and radic@@ alism .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundament@@ alism are poor in the country . &quot;
&quot; Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook would have more to do before the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community ask for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform , but it does not work . &quot;
to cens@@ or such words will only bring more hatred inside the various communities .
&quot; furthermore , it seems that without local context or technical support , and so words like &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; pe@@ ver@@ curr@@ y &quot; &quot; have banned . &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they have made mistakes , they tried not to correct the over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed poet . &quot;
&quot; if they would only have a little more respect for the 15 million benefits , they would give them a big turnover , would be great . &quot;
Fac@@ ebooks automatic cens@@ orship has provided a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now become funny about Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech , to see if their Po@@ sts are removed from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook Po@@ sts that have no hate speech , but nevertheless removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ical text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch a pe@@ an@@ curr@@ y and watch an Indian movie .
&quot; just to try out , whether Facebook contains the mail , containing the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
scre@@ enshot with permission is used .
&quot; the post states &quot; If you are a doctor , do then cure people ? &quot;
scre@@ enshot with permission is used .
&quot; over the past five years , extreme nationalist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists are the social networks used to expand their voices and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks should also cause violence in the communities in Myanmar , in addition to missi@@ le , where conflicts between Muslims and Buddh@@ ists have forced thousands to escape . &quot;
Facebook was critici@@ zed for his failure to put hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sides under control .
&quot; but instead of just cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have better to look at the context than on code focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is at the end of the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 . &quot;
the marriage is in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now illeg@@ ally .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanimously decided that this practice is to ban this practice , so that the actual age now is at 18 . &quot;
&quot; prior to this change of the marriage Act , some members rav@@ ished in practice , and in May 2016 , it came to a large public out@@ cry . at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leaders of the various religious groups of the country gathered that the state does not interfere with , since that , age , do not determine the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are an authorized partner of the UN child rights Convention , the min@@ ors as , every man under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; statistics from the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were already married to 15 , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago 2 : 8 per cent , and with 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Statisti@@ cal Office of the country showed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys under 19 were married . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements , who tried to re @-@ create laws for children before , followed at the bottom and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring this outcome . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no concerns to say the critics of the children &apos;s deer , they ought to be dar@@ ed to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition sort of tensions in this really uncomplicated thing , and sometime there came a doubt about whether the opposition would not agree to the draft law at all . &quot;
&quot; however , at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the marriage before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who was deb@@ ated , so that he would be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the President of the country must agree and pro@@ claim the law .
&quot; one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave us a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle to Inst@@ agram once again : &quot;
Mr Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill &apos;s accus@@ ation against child marriage was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and none of them decided on it .
&quot; after having decided prior to the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws were finally changed to the marriage .
&quot; Facebook @-@ member Lo@@ vell Francis , who held a ministry in the education of education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has too much time and unnecessary talk needed to wear the heart of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s toe is in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now illegal , and this is worth almost every price . &quot;
&quot; while A@@ bel Jackson of the opinion was , it was definitely long enough to create the practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was happy that the day was finally come : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by Lara Qu@@ entr@@ y@@ - Thomas , which states : , Excellent news ! &quot;
the marriage Act has been decided .
&quot; age ages - 18 , Vo@@ ices - 35 for this - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group , which said quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted : &quot;
the actual age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent from the age of 18 .
&quot; the draft to change the marriage Act was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
in the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 members and of which 35 were present at the vote .
all the members who were against were voted for the law .
the marriage is under no longer permitted in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # for marri@@ age@@ @-@ offs .
many thanks to all activists who have put him out .
congratulations .
a thank you to our MEPs .
&quot; but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , therefore , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the best known Hin@@ du @-@ Organisation of the country . &quot;
&quot; prior to months Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to undertake judicial steps , should the law be adopted , and he seems to be releasing his promises . &quot;
&quot; during the general @-@ state Adv@@ oc@@ ate Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it would be quite lawful unless Mahar@@ aj takes against the law , they wish to address the debate on the subject differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
&quot; dear Sat , if we , rather than keeping the discussion so generally , in a way that only panic and injustice may call , that the state would be mis@@ used to them , that they may be of great , un@@ compromising men who are ab@@ used to them , would you then be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you believe that this is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether it comes to a judicial approach against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children are legal in different gra@@ dations or continue the norm , although there are laws that they are under@@ stated . &quot;

for over a month Turkey now regul@@ ates Turkey the popular and the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia .
&quot; day by day becomes clearer , how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information . &quot;
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV @-@ series rep@@ el against the blocking .
&quot; although many techn@@ o @-@ sealed internet users are used to use connection tools for block websites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article by the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third @-@ largest VPN @-@ prevalence of the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been published articles from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the internet have been adopted since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 5@@ 6@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; after China , Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to massive cens@@ orship in Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform continues to remain closed , there are now several Mir@@ r@@ or@@ pages ( pages that reflect the content from Wikipedia and often updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary U@@ ses ) , backed by the platform all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer @-@ network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator @-@ machine connections ) which is not based on the system of domain names and thus made a complete cens@@ orship . &quot;
the content is un@@ available in spite of legal prohibition .
in a blog post IP@@ FS reports about its efforts :
&quot; after we heard the news ( about the blocking from Wikipedia ) , we put everything from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read content on de@@ centralized and distributed manner . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ os@@ a.@@ org . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS was also assumed that this step was performed independent of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no Live@@ - or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he saw around him never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with poorly positioned motives and out @-@ made colors .
the motivated himself to carry a camera with himself and trying to pro@@ claim the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , Nep@@ ali , strives to bring Nepal as an animal world on the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hometown right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , it offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw the attention to Nep@@ ali . &quot;
&quot; he described Facebook , as it helps him to make this first class situation at work : &quot;
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate game photographer ! ! &quot;
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had a call from my father that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river would be a leop@@ ard .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I got rid of my camera and was there a few minutes there .
&quot; my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the leop@@ ard was found , and I immediately started to crack pictures ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar strives to cooperate with authorities to achieve global recognition for Nep@@ ali and Nature and wants to deepen the understanding of that wild animals are not as horri@@ fying as they look .
and he should know it because he already stood by face to face :
a tiger can not distur@@ b himself from the opinion of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
&quot; I was on the way home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ y@@ k appeared . he immediately puts himself away , we look at it and he star@@ ched me through the S@@ al trees ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ ali and wild animals is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days long , and mostly lived in a tent in order to take pictures of Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days it lasted until he was able to photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodations . &quot;

&quot; this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az and was originally written on Video Volun@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization in India . &quot;
a revised version has been published here as a part of a content @-@ sharing convention .
&quot; in many parts of India , women are avoiding the greatest care to speak the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead , they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h for women to respect the husband , as well as fear of the consequences , they should dis@@ regard the norm to maintain this practice alive . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was judged from the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a by a sword , and by its family and the village community , after having addressed a married relatives with his name . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives , likewise not called by name , is also widespread in men . however , they have far fewer ri@@ ad@@ missions to fear , if at all , they should not come up with this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health workers , as well as house@@ wives , a unique club and were therefore quickly becoming the main table theme of the city . &quot;
&quot; it is a place for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al who is operated by the community of Video Volun@@ te@@ ers and advocates the dismantling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was working for seven years with the help of her video camera at the un@@ covering of practices , such as children &apos;s heating up to the exile of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and leads these clubs . &quot;
she reports how these clubs created a safe place for those women and at the same time have made them amb@@ ass@@ adors of change .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini in her discussion showed that women did not name their hus@@ bands . &quot;
she decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem that women can easily identify with .
&quot; speaking to the name of their hus@@ bands , a Br@@ other , which they gave to all obligations , and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini writes :
tradition testi@@ fied that a woman is respected her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not keep this in , is regarded as a woman without morality . &quot;
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we never have thought about this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning Roh@@ ini , who had never named her husband had never called on behalf of his husband , to try out at home as it was running . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion on her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini said :
my mother @-@ in @-@ in @-@ law and my husband have been silent for a long time after the video was finished .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should call him by name at his name . &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage Roh@@ ini began her first discussion club .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some felt that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women would be protected . &quot;
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection the women are trying to get the discussion with an exercise in motion .
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different emotions - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; If we cannot say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can tell us how they want it , does it mean that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in the married women never declared the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini said :
&quot; a woman was so shy that she only ki@@ cked her throughout the exercise , and another decided that the whole au@@ stri@@ te frustration turned his frustration against him and his family by cur@@ bing it . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; in the adren@@ alin rush about it , having broken down with an ancient bro@@ ker , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands in the name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
in the next days Roh@@ ini has received a variety of reports .
the husband of a wife called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put to the women in his head : his wife could not stop his name .
another club member decided to do it with dinner before the whole family .
&quot; as her mother @-@ in @-@ law she was star@@ ing , she was afraid and said that there was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said I had to do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in the event was less understanding and the situation ar@@ ded in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the cin@@ o@@ ber@@ red point on the forehead , which shows the E@@ h@@ est@@ atus : &quot;
why only women must show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would carry the cin@@ o@@ ber@@ red spot if he did it . &quot;
he was eighth only and I listened to him to carry him .
&quot; the other women ceased to have ceased , but they think they are in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it in some days . &quot;
for many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals .
&quot; we make a trip with each discussion .
usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want the women to worry about who could hear , &quot; she says . &quot;
during the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days in their life with cake . they danced and che@@ eks and spoke about things that they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years , and yet I have also talked about some things such as our identities on our hus@@ bands are not yet spoken . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
in a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have been carried only sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most it is okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ war @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a tro@@ users ; they did not trust . &quot;
&quot; after much argument and discussion about the merits of their own clothes @-@ election , mor@@ als joined with the Sar@@ is and much more , smu@@ g@@ gling Roh@@ ini in a panel discussion , so that the women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they have now decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans , and Roh@@ ini is certain that they will succeed . &quot;
&quot; to the question , whether in the five months have changed something since their first discussion , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things will slowly come into roles : &quot;
we have taken only small steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then again we listened to the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including myself , do it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved . &quot;
only one or two will continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now carry Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
&quot; the women in the discussion know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hag@@ gle for more freedom of movement , or their own clothes @-@ choice - at the end of a difficult to navig@@ ated river . &quot;
&quot; giving each other self confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting on the same boat . &quot;
how to explain the Roh@@ ini :
every one of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us confidence that something will change .
&quot; I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction , if every woman goes home in the club and told other people about what we are talking about and what we do . &quot;
we all sit in the same boat .

scre@@ enshot of the official YouTube channel of The Beatles .
&quot; on June 29th of this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag , during which during the course of the year ( The Beatles @-@ commemor@@ ative Day ) was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans were exchanged for the Beatles and their appreciation for the Beatles . &quot;
the visit of the Beatles in the year 1966 is considered to be a visit to the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ ania , who interviewed the Beatles , 1964 in London exclusively , was noted on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just under five days the Beatles was in the country , but this has passed to release the Japanese . &quot;
&quot; the people here have become clear quite quickly , that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms . &quot;
many known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beatles also came to Japan for the first time .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; &quot; Ry@@ u@@ i@@ chi Is@@ aka , President of the Sing@@ ing Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the Online Magazine Nik@@ ola Asian Review . &quot;

I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; -@@ d@@ oll John Lenn@@ on should be present or not .
&quot; and as it belongs to fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the known places that are related to the band . &quot;
&quot; if you love the Beatles , these are your 5 places that you absolutely need to visit &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )

&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping of two people for organ trading , probably for un@@ believer purposes , the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the intern@@ als . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ k , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and some of the organs have been removed .
&quot; two men were arrested and subsequently , they stood that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used . &quot;
&quot; there will give the local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a glorious man of gold could bring gold , old or wealth , explained the police officers of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia of the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that successive attacks on the long @-@ member men were registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
&quot; another group , the aim of Er@@ m@@ ord@@ ances is for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the fact that UN in 2016 led to a mission in the South African country to investigate these practices .
&quot; the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight against these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudices . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who are planning to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambi@@ que who are goal of ritual attacks , warned the Moz@@ ambi@@ que police following the latest coverage of three small @-@ strong men based on their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ k , where the bronze statues were arrested . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ hai Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and residents of the city of In@@ ham@@ bane in the south of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , said that the local police have already been going on : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the two thousand men .
&quot; the persecution and assassination of two @-@ strong individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district Mor@@ Rum@@ a , province of Zam@@ be@@ é@@ zia , for probably super@@ dev@@ out rituals , has resulted in the police of the Republic of Moz@@ ambi@@ que into consideration ( PR@@ M ) which , according to which the victims would have in their head , the riches of the riches . &quot;
in the last days three men were murdered with hair loss in this part of the country .
&quot; Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Samantha shared the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger &apos;s arms Sn@@ ai@@ pp@@ a who pointed out that the problem is part of the larger social difficulties , Moz@@ ambi@@ que is opposite : &quot;
&quot; I would like to s@@ hab@@ by E@@ IN Mos@@ ambi@@ que , DAS S@@ I would have attracted to the road , when the teachers would have ashamed to claim sex against good notes , and others not hurt or even their lives to get their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor col@@ dest or &quot; black magic &quot; are hun@@ ted , which aim to reach their own wealth . &quot;
&quot; despite the seriousness of the phenomenon , some could not escape the opportunity for mak@@ ab@@ uses humor . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , Wissenschaft@@ lerin by Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambi@@ que and enthusiastic Twitter feed , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the district Mor@@ Rum@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ rod as well as the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , both of them are common : &quot;

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia that probably was recently done .
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June , that he had been delivered to hospital because of liver cancer . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; after he was involved in the draft of the Charter of 08 , a manifes@@ to , which calls for democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has called &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; and told a speaker , he did not require it as &quot; &quot; not required to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China continues to get calls from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , Di@@ ary in Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release or give it a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely raised the subject . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ized several reactions from the foreign country .
United Nations United Nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met in late June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment whether the United Nations should put pressure to give Li@@ u abroad a treatment . &quot;
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ enden refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relation between China and Norway was in Sto@@ cks after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in Li@@ u after the Nobel Peace Prize , although the Norwegian government did not end up with the decision . &quot;
diplomatic relations have only continued until December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon banks to China since the exports were largely blocked since 2010 .
&quot; after the message has spread that Li@@ u was seriously suffering , the Nobel @-@ committee brought his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to its imprisonment , he was not able to accept his prize . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately by the house arrest , and allow him to seek medical support where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the peak of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us on June 30th : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all the restrictions of Mr Li@@ us wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they are supposed to meet and receive all the visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States of America
&quot; us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared with that the Americans , &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the opportunity to treat it abroad , in so far as it may help him with his recovery . &quot;
&quot; speaker in the US Embassy in China , Mary and Pol@@ ley , announced that the message to the Chinese authorities on 27 June announced that the message from the Chinese authorities to release , not only Li@@ u , but also to liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the invitation of the US Embassy moved up an angry response from China to itself , with the exterior of the State Department that &quot; no country have the right to for@@ bid and un@@ answer@@ able comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the couple :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as travel at liberty and access to the medical care of its choice , to which they are entitled according to the Chinese Constitution and legal system , as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Di@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in the Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; I urge China to un@@ condition@@ ally release Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , so that he can go into a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o &quot;
Germany
&quot; German government speaker Steff@@ en Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; takes all the medical support he needed &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 , in Hamburg . &quot;
&quot; previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing of the news agency Re@@ uters , China had great concerns whether the vor@@ tex could over@@ sh@@ ado@@ be the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada in Canada
&quot; on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John McC@@ all@@ um asked China to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to worry about his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us attorney told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ us wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always watch the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed with someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot;
McC@@ all@@ um relates further :
&quot; Canada is calling for its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and the freedom of expression for the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France
&quot; France &apos;s Foreign Office , China urged to release China in an Declaration on 29 June , Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures have to be taken to make sure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o gets all treatments that he , regardless of where , needed . furthermore , his wife and his family can have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; even though the news @-@ file France Info has already reported that the French Government of Li@@ u would be welcomed in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information out whether France is going to take him finally . &quot;
Taiwan
&quot; the Council of popular affairs in Taiwan called on 27 June to release Li@@ u and demonstrate a greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to pursue political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; the Tai@@ wan@@ ese MEP Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu also called for the ruling Democratic progressive party in China , also called the sick intellectual Li@@ u to treat in Taiwan . &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself very worried in an explanation on June 28 at Li@@ u and gave me that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives that he took and for whom he was severely re@@ pressed , to a harmon@@ ic , stable and aff@@ lu@@ ent China , which in turn had contributed to a peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I personally felt very moved and encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem silly as Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am should be considered in Singapore as a city . &quot;
this remark has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osph@@ ere .
&quot; during the meeting at a meeting of the international branch of the Law@@ yers Association of the State of New York , the Ministers alleged that many people critici@@ zed the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they are compared to Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he supported that Singapore should be considered a city .
no one has questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
this is the most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the Blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; turning the logic to defend the existing authorized practice of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , according to all our efforts and sacri@@ fici@@ encies that create valuable land , you can say that we are ultimately no land . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the semb@@ lance of escape from the responsibilities , a mandatory violation . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons given by Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries , &quot; in view of what he inevitably appeared un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore would be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once you reach the theme of the topic , the good old mor@@ er emerges from the author@@ itarian fe@@ asts to be pre@@ ten@@ tious , leaving the tw@@ isted logic , since they fit better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end of the final week of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , they were given answers to their American guests regarding our press , our country @-@ dict@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ responses . &quot;
he un@@ resolved these issues with non @-@ responses of rational manner .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am to make his opinion clear as it did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; Singapore is not a country , but a city is , so to which country belongs to our city ... &quot;
shortly . I understand nothing .
&quot; I would be very grateful if our precious K Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take the trouble to clear this point , unless it was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; announ@@ cing his comment on the blog , he points out regarding cri@@ tiques to read the entire trans@@ cript of the conference so that one could better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , according to which Singapore is a city and no land . &quot;
read the trans@@ cript .
&quot; he said that Singapore is more &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore would be so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he experienced Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Singapore &quot; &quot; is not a country , &quot; he obviously does not mean it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , who is the leader of a new generation , a polem@@ ical statement . &quot;
&quot; I am over what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said , very embarrass@@ ed ... &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t know with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expect - do I agree with them or not , but this is another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , a member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore , I have doubts , and I am not even sure if he really believes that he is really interested and aware of what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek review comp@@ lies the weaknesses of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; did Mr Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; &quot; blessed an error &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian leader ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered to be an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , which country goes back to Singapore &apos;s sovereign rights ? &quot;
Singapore is unique ; it is a land and a city .
&quot; since he plays an important role within the government , the statements of Mr Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the Singapur come to its military service , defend it only their city but not their land ? &quot;
whom must our Prime Minister pay bills ?
what is the value of our pink human resource type ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Jour@@ ney of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and has always been a city : &quot;
&quot; I have not told what I said , &quot;
this phrase seems to have been anno@@ yed many Singapur ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we always were a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; &quot; etc . , but this is not quite true . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; cute Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Fl@@ anders .
scre@@ enshot of a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editors : what is the most ab@@ used aspect about your homeland or home country ?
&quot; their answers are published here as part of a continuous series , with the rum@@ ours over certain parts of the world will be revealed and another fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot;
&quot; the newest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
&quot; the question which is most asked to me in Japan is : &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; I am then . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and back in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered to be polite , interested in its inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ or by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; on my clari@@ fying position then most of the standard answer : &quot; &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Eis@@ ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans may cook in@@ wardly against anger , when they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t bother . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know himself , there is little that Can@@ adi@@ ans differ from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans get a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all dear Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans however ... .
&quot; so it was already when I began to travel around the world 20 years ago , before Donald Tr@@ ump , in front of the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always worn small m@@ ap@@ le sheets on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
with us there is no weapons !
gender @-@ sex marriages has been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are polite .
&quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Canada is supposed to be regarded as the tolerant country vis @-@ à @-@ ethnic groups . &quot;
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
&quot; first , I have many American friends that I very admired . &quot;
it would make me nothing if you were able to switch myself with Johnny from Dallas to Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &apos; nice .
&quot; first : as &quot; nice &quot; , &quot; said , &quot; &quot; nett &quot; &quot; is basically to be dispens@@ ed - just as the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but tragic , un@@ important figure of N@@ ed Fl@@ anders from &quot; The Simp@@ son &quot; ( who has an own Canadian Double ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Fl@@ anders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing by which one can encounter . &quot;
&quot; inno@@ cu@@ ous , being un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and no attention to deserve . &quot;
&quot; this can be something good , if you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around one . &quot;
&quot; I would even go , to say that the desire to be free and alone , a leading part of Can@@ adi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to only take care of our own affairs .
&quot; what out@@ si@@ ders are &quot; nice , &quot; perhaps simply cool courtesy . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans are often talking about the fence with the neighbors .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then J@@ ustin Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage in order to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada even sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ des Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop @-@ band released a music video , which took over the Jun@@ ta , which took the power to restore the power and to restore the civil government , in spite of their promise , to continue the country . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Col@@ our describes a young man who tells about the rules of his girlfriend .
&quot; although not expressly political , the music video refers directly to the continued military rule of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was an amazing success .
&quot; in the first three days , this was divided on Facebook up@@ loaded video 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and was awarded 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , the Charlie @-@ Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to look at this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta dom@@ inion . &quot;
&quot; once again , take a look at these shots of the video that relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has per@@ secuted in the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; possibly refer to the dra@@ in paragraph 44 of the preliminary constitution , which makes absolute decisions to the commander @-@ chief of the army absolute decision @-@ making on important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the &quot; &quot; setup &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals who are viewed by the jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer criminal , whose v@@ ague and unclear regulations are often used by authorities to pursue activ@@ ist and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army , the online content supervised and individuals who were accused , the monarchy is sl@@ ander@@ ed to have criminal pro@@ secuted . &quot;
Thailand continues to set a strike against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ esty ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the war was launched in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup in the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to follow , is their decision to buy expensive U boats , although security experts they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax evasion . &quot;
&quot; in the video even shown how people will be thrown into a black delivery car before submitting them into a detention camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and are threatened with Internet users , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song members of the band , who im@@ it@@ ated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; im@@ it@@ ated , who was already used by Put@@ sch oppos@@ ers during the protests in 2014 . &quot;
life goes on to the ruins of the gh@@ ost cities in Eastern Asia

&quot; the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society is very slowly reco@@ vering in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; over 20 years have passed since the Georgian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ astic war has been officially cancelled , but its s@@ cars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the deserted villages of the northern District in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the carbon sink of Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , shut@@ down , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the area in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
&quot; today , most of the Russians and deportation are living in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called Ge@@ ister@@ cians in the East Asia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period here more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these cities . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the overall population of the district was 16@@ ,000 people , after having barely asc@@ ended over a decade . &quot;
&quot; 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot;
&quot; the empty fif@@ teenth @-@ story flo@@ cks of the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s , the chr@@ isti@@ an@@ tics of Christ are called symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are se@@ ab@@ ed and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ k@@ ha I met an old older man .
he starts a conversation and it is hard to end this .
&quot; this is all a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is less ambi@@ valent . &quot;
in front of the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens who served all of the community . &quot;
&quot; now , there are only paved road with f@@ aded splendor @-@ buildings . &quot;
people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ k@@ ha there are about fifty inhabitants .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the Chr@@ u@@ ush@@ cho@@ v , which still accomo@@ date one or two families , one can recognize at the balconies , where laundry . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when she was able to discover myself with the camera in the hand , they immediately move back . &quot;
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden us , this is all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers their girlfriend somewhat and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small tur@@ quoise mining companies called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ s@@ istence sector ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal needs ) such as cattle farming , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it is difficult to come over the rounds .
&quot; in winter , the district administration supplies free candles and bread to the villages in the winter . &quot;

&quot; I do not know what is going to happen , but we will join zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
&quot; about ten years ago , an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya worked as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Jung@@ han@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not been able to leave from Ab@@ ch@@ asia , to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; she tells . &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants no financial help from her daughter and ins@@ ists that she instead supports her young grand@@ son .
Gal@@ inas Mon@@ ente are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot;
ante G@@ alya tells that she and other villagers try to meet regularly and holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; if holidays are , we visit us . &quot;
but we cannot do this - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; as she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; calls T@@ ante G@@ alya her to . &quot; they said , we could join zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; I do not know what is going to happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ational Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and five common children in their house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she reminds himself of the co@@ il in front of the war .
&quot; despite the relatives , who live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ asia simply broke away ) , they did not leave the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( governor @-@ town in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but this will still take something , &quot; she explains . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha gets about $ 9 child money for every child .
your husband is working in coal .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ ash@@ as kinder@@ garten was once found , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens . &quot;
&quot; it tells you that it was a very fri@@ ghtening situation first , when many people left the village after the war . &quot;
but in the course of time she lost her fears .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we have no fear of the dark street or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
I remember each day as the city and the war were once .
&quot; when our conversation comes to the end , a little boy takes over us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ased from him .
he plays with the ball that crosses the hill .
a group of children now follow the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them throw stones on the falling building . &quot;
these ruins are part of their childhood who care for in@@ descri@@ bable in their life .
you do not know it differently .

in Mexico there are home &quot; Mama Africa &quot; migrants on their long journey
&quot; Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the State of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

this article by Amy Br@@ aking was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and appears here with kind permission .
&quot; across the way of migrants , across Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the mex@@ ican city of Tap@@ es@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
&quot; it is managed by a 5@@ 9@@ - year @-@ old Mex@@ i@@ an@@ erin , a small woman with a cor@@ als @-@ pink bri@@ ghtly and gold @-@ colored ear rings in t@@ ed@@ dy bears form . &quot;
&quot; it is called Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez , and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name of Mama Africa . &quot;
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a goal for Afri@@ cans and shar@@ ks that are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for approximately 2.@@ 50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms , with high @-@ storey walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rots in a cage .
there is no sign for a hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian immigrants arrive here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people say in full @-@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you in Africa ? &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some also have already slept on cardboard . &quot;
it does not want to reject anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to hospital when they are sick , they buy them medications that they cannot pay , they mas@@ hed them with a bal@@ sam , exhausted by the long journey exhausted . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , is arrived in a short time ago . &quot;
I asked him whether mother Africa is an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a sta@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot;
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ pack .
&quot; yes , yes &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her , because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very lovingly .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and three children .
&quot; they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move towards north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well known name on the track , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
&quot; he tells that the Hai@@ tian and the Afri@@ cans often travel the route , and that the Afri@@ cans already speak to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; as many of his companion , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil previously and worked as a construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Football Championship . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he has started his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ kal .
I ask him whether he will have contact with Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our Mother and we never leave them again , &quot; &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that their guests often send text messages when they went away to gr@@ ind them or to report it over the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith in the drive of her work is .
&quot; she does not know much about Africa , but their guests have taught her to cook the chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants to travel through tap@@ e@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the town , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have absorbed migrants in their little house . &quot;
it is a poli@@ cem@@ an and has found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are too expensive .
&quot; he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; there are 25 people there , mainly Hai@@ tian . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on blankets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
&quot; Valencia explains that he knows , what the guests do through . &quot;
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border across the desert and we have suffered .
there are places where people can help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was rejected by a raid on his work place from the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants that travels through Tap@@ es@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their houses for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ do@@ va Mel@@ én@@ dez told me that he is fled to people in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to sup@@ press money without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ es@@ ula he asked for accommodation and a unknown , a single @-@ one , has offered him their roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family lives still there and she tried to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the cor@@ ridors the passengers always consult their phones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests a large part of Somalia .
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy to have her house full , but she is also nostal@@ gically because of those who went away . &quot;
like a proud grandmother they feed it in their album with a lot of photos .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair@@ dr@@ au@@ ght that she has made a customer , some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more , boy and Old . &quot;
she laughs sad while she pre@@ asked her briefly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; they have been gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
&quot; a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter users , and &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minority region in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on 10 July , the mobile users at the Ti@@ an@@ shan District of the City of Ur@@ um@@ qi was given a mobile notification in which it indicates the district government , a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , the app will be encouraged to access terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; but , however , the authorities use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the Autonom@@ ous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because they had installed the app , had replaced news with a private white chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the communication of the police , the app was able to determine the sources and distribution paths of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a shelter with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the blocking porno@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ jan and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to control their home network remot@@ ely . &quot;
this app with the filters for min@@ ors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these features can of course be used in many ways .

this introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reports about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often gri@@ mmer for those who live in remote , pressing ethnic minority regions , such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit ri@@ ots and dis@@ content in the conflict @-@ areas , the authorities often arrange extreme C@@ ens@@ ored and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ in@@ ous internet de@@ activ@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the media Out@@ let Media Out@@ let &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( or &quot; &quot; spinning &quot; &quot; on the part of the net &quot; &quot; ) , that published messages in China , showed photos from a check@@ point , at the poli@@ c@@ emen acquired the inhabitants random@@ ly as if they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ano make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile alert required people to install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are interested in a check@@ point with a device without these software , it could be de@@ tained by up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for the technological development .
&quot; you have the people forced to use devices , which are intended for elderly people . &quot;
this is a form of imprisonment by the rest of the rest technology .
we are back in Mal@@ os China .

&quot; in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang are potentially a response to the instructions of the City Council , to minimize the dissemination of illegal content . &quot;

&quot; this is the first of six reports in a series of &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane defines his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far away from our blue , virtual world , you look at it and make sure you &apos;re alone on a place where everything is gone . &quot;
&quot; everything has been dis@@ b@@ anded after and after , and revealed a truth which is clearly visible from both inside and outside . &quot;
one that makes their name all honor .
one who threw up in a list of feelings and phrases that no metaph@@ ors allow .
&quot; but when you get into reality and you look back behind the scenes - beyond acting , the beautiful scenes and performers - the characters in nature transform themselves into flesh and blood , and all sh@@ it to death . &quot;
&quot; all doubt dis@@ solve in smoke and you become aware of your existence even if the Earth continues on the A@@ xis of Un@@ hei@@ ls . you realize that you &apos;re caught here between the walls , your parents , and before them your grandparents , stone to build stone . &quot;
&quot; they have been arrested me and my father three times , but they didn &apos;t yet have to come , so that I will form@@ ulate my lesson - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot;
he presented his power over us by giving even the simplest concepts that we knew .
five young people were demol@@ ished during a peaceful prot@@ ections like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; it was enough , so that the city was sh@@ attered the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; all city districts sought , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was silent , rainy , at the wrong time , even though I did not put high demands on a city that has st@@ amped to the arteries with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had cal@@ med down after the power supply in the neighbourhood had to work . &quot;
&quot; I per@@ ges the silence , by cried out several times &quot; &quot; All O &quot; &quot; by my house@@ holder . &quot;
I heard my voice against the silence against all .
&quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together . &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we joined us to a glorious picture that met my expectations . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment , you realize that you are free the spirit from the lamp , but it just does not interest you in the bar@@ ley . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet with the military security @-@ building . &quot;
he laid upon .
&quot; then , I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you your voice , after you put her all the way up to the office of the security service out of the body . &quot;
I came there .
the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I am now .
&quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; &quot; let me hear , as you are &quot; &quot; All O &quot; &quot; or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am , if we are not nearby . &quot;
his h@@ asser@@ tive eyes were set on me .
&quot; and you will find yourself real , look in the eyes and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood before this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so safe to me , as I answered , &quot; I have not thought that you have already forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I have never ceased to look at you in your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I did not regret a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; and put him in sol@@ itary , and his father just with it . &quot;
&quot; his father just like this , &quot;
the stri@@ fe of this cur@@ sed proposition lies with me until today in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a spiritual torture that I was exposed to monthly torture . &quot;
I ro@@ am the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
then once again through the yard and into the second office that leads through a course to the individual cells .
I imagine all details exactly before I cared for the space .
otherwise they probably have a larger cell to me this time .
&quot; I have to share them with just one more prisoners and must immediately put me away , without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , who felt like a whole life , the officers left the cell , and I grab@@ bed a familiar communication method : with the fist to beat the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned , that my friend @-@ value was a &quot; &quot; first @-@ inf@@ ant &quot; . &quot; &quot;
after a long hesitation he finally rep@@ lied to me .
&quot; apparently , in none of the surrounding cells there was a respectable man @-@ aged man that looks similar to me and called &quot; &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the perfect darkness , no distinctive coun@@ tenance can be seen in me , and doctors are not here ; we are all only numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like me ? &quot;
all the answers are his existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
maybe he will be able to hear immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would stop him if I stay . &quot;
Li@@ ar .
&quot; I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to sell all these cro@@ ws , which are lab@@ elled on the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance , I still hear &quot; &quot; All ahu &quot; &quot; scre@@ am . &quot;
&quot; it must be approximately 10 am in the evening , always in order to lay the scre@@ ams , every day . &quot;
the door opens up .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light which presented us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; &quot; Don@@ ner &quot; , &quot; rel@@ ying on the 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to hear sounds .
&quot; this was the secret to protect the state security in front of us , and to prevent the tra@@ itors and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played their denomin@@ ational black@@ out map and smell the close field of view of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which is not a land ; it is a curse to call it coexistence to transform the criminals to their sound into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I cared for the audi@@ t@@ orium and tre@@ mb@@ ling on Abu Ima@@ d , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me so . &quot;
&quot; he begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that escaped him &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important to your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon be an end . &quot;
I rep@@ lied not .
&quot; I have used to answer , not to answer . &quot;
I can really not say exactly when insul@@ ts and blows after a friendly conversation has become an ordinary communication instrument .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
&quot; any voice in me said that I had to get used to it or to get used to be punished , even though I did nothing to earn this punishment . &quot;
an punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to rip me as much meat as possible from the body .
he is called the affection@@ ately &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it begins with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your head@@ sman goes back to your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with it , and you cannot with@@ hold your cry . &quot;
&quot; my cry did not waste him yet enough , why they exchanged the pipe by a cable . &quot;
&quot; during my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ator worked earlier as a trash collection , or if that belonged to the normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined to present us the ones from their view , great invention of a giant cab@@ al . &quot;
&quot; within one hour , three of them altern@@ ated , while I was still in the row . &quot;
&quot; I had lost all feeling in my body - and my voice , which is why I heard to cry out . &quot;
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and didn &apos;t seem like a favor by reason why he came up as a neighbour to an electric shock .
electricity crossed my whole body to store enough to my entire district .
&quot; my half @-@ naked body , which was stretched out on the ground , was the perfect electricity leader . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided he had his duty for this night .
this must have been so at midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; a few hours left , which occurred to me as minutes . &quot;
then the call for the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I answered with the voice of a ti@@ pped youths : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be quiet and throw away you , you will be moved . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always been released .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jordan R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b spends most of his time in@@ doors ; sometimes he lo@@ osed to his canvas , time to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
but what you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine to discover lips .
&quot; he lives on the top floor of his family house , which had heard them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel had completed its occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family had been forced to escape from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ es ( e.g. : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been an im@@ passion@@ ed activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority , asking her old proven opinions on gender roles , sexuality , and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ h music . &quot;
&quot; with his music that deals often with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , but also calls on the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues do not only find in his hometown Am@@ man relevance , but also in cities that will vary from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as a person who is not restricted by boundaries in his mind , and he can have his own statement by the people who suffer the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not exist openly , it swe@@ pt up against the US foreign policy a special exhau@@ st . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b believes that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones , to do anything with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian struggle &quot; of the second generation , &quot; even if he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own living circumstances , &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , while in water deleted Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ramadan . at this time it is intended for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Israeli law also states that public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal .
&quot; obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking down the ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a ver@@ tically hot jun@@ it@@ ag has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the s@@ lu@@ dge of warm coffee and the wa@@ ver@@ ge of the K@@ ent cigarette is in the nose first and foremost of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially if one has a look to the neighboring countries . &quot;
therefore it is easy to do basic things - as to drink in public during the Ramadan water - in order not to land in prison .
&quot; recently the Interior Ministry of Jordan introduced a performance of the band Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
some parliamentary MPs that support the Islamic Action front - the j@@ ord@@ an branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homo@@ sexual fron@@ trun@@ ner Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no to resist the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert @-@ telling .
&quot; the MP and former press spokes@@ person in the Islamic coalition of D@@ IMA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that said the concert &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot;
&quot; many also claim to be the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world , be more dangerous activ@@ ism that questioned the established legitimacy of author@@ itarian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la preached the j@@ ord@@ al people as &quot; &quot; progressive suppor@@ ter of human rights &quot; , &quot; which continued to work for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement probably seems to be not simply sil@@ ver@@ ted rhet@@ oric , but actually an increasingly clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs work . &quot;
in 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b traditional gender is to be suffering because he formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
&quot; the image shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently crus@@ hed woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red sea , perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , the number of &quot; Hon@@ orary tomorrow &quot; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of Hon@@ orary tomorrow reached its peak ; however , Jordan was still missing that Jordan was missing the institutional infrastructure to support the women who tried victims of murder and home violence , to provide adequate manner . &quot;
&quot; according to a law for Crime fighting from 1954 that women , which are exposed to in@@ wardly violence , &quot; in@@ definite time in prison , and for their release is often necessary for years of bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee by the family that the woman has nothing to happen . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ bs Music enjoys great popularity , and is known for it , not even before subjects , which in his country is long as tab@@ by . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , however , that he is doing his music , the full explicit anch@@ oring to sexuality , freedom and expression , not separate from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; I was troubled , &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes on the question of the Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Lav@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; gh@@ o@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
&quot; the list of the songs that are political in the core , can be continued . &quot;
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated many times :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , in which one , in his words , &quot; can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , He@@ ter@@ o- or homo@@ sexuality . &quot;
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + -@@ individuals were strongly cens@@ ored by 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b introduced an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an online program Ro@@ ya to remember that his comments from the context were demol@@ ished , rot@@ ated and his opinion were cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was loaded without cuts , but not only a converted version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b buys the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homo@@ sexu@@ als do not speak to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he mentioned Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who still remained in memory today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks yourself : if Abu Nu@@ what if later on behalf of the calibr@@ ation should work , in the eighth century openly about homo@@ sexuality could be able , why can the Jord@@ an@@ ier not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the Has@@ hem@@ ite Kingdom , there is nothing new that the government bonds attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive votes will be sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the British intelligence service held several former government members and members of the association agreement , with the ration@@ ale , they expressed themselves cri@@ tically on the problems that are deeply rooted in the land deeply rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of what is the concert of H@@ da@@ i@@ bs , according to that only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to change a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ier . &quot;
&quot; for him progress is a continuous giving and taking . Jordan , Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la has now been delayed for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - it looks like H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , than@@ king and inner changes . it is certain that these changes take place from day to day at the heart of the Nig@@ erian society . &quot;
&quot; finally , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dre@@ aming , like millions of other Arabs , from an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he dreams not only dre@@ amt of his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of it . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region with the help of music , art and literature will become a real and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , spreading uni@@ tion and artificial way of guided democracies . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until that time , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to down@@ stream and thus can also resist . &quot;
&quot; this report was made possible by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting , the A@@ man as a student Fel@@ low . &quot;
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these great , extravag@@ ant warri@@ ors are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the fog festival .
&quot; thought that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival that is usually recorded in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ cus . another theory asser@@ ted that the mar@@ sh , the drums and dancing over more than a thousand years were taken away , in the armies from West Japan to the northeast , to force the indigenous people of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , into the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we could catch a few great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . &quot;
I &apos;ve been looking forward to the me@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fort@@ resses are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival to spend the only true - and still a breath @-@ taking way for this summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and I watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high fixed was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; rarely were external appearance and body care as important as in this story , because they help to maintain the Peruvian youth from the crime and encourage a legitimate profession like those of the hair . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street ro@@ b and illegal drug trafficking are daily . &quot;
&quot; in April 2017 , the survey revealed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel secure . &quot;
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
&quot; the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Brazil ) , has led to getting more and more ordinary citizens in the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers which can form these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers de Bar@@ ber@@ os , who has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there , experts will join each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric L@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( further videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy which is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to persu@@ ade young people to get their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools , and instead of bad advice , training in hair@@ style art , which allows them to find work . &quot;
motivated by this activity and the offering opportunities have seen dozens of young people that they can take a job which is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops in the beginning of March and reported on some of their successes :
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only school in the community and the district where we are very proud , because out of love for the children we have built up this educational community . &quot;
Colombia : love Let@@ ters to guer@@ rilla warfare

use with friendly permission .
&quot; the following article is the published version of the paper &quot; &quot; love message &quot; &quot; guer@@ rilla warfare , which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people who we know ?
&quot; is it not yet much more important , people who feel free to face affection ? &quot;
&quot; this question was about the two young Colom@@ bian activists of Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga , of the Foundation Bogot@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os of the Young @-@ Youth Foundation , and inspired it to write letters to the campaign C@@ art@@ as p@@ or la Re@@ ver@@ li@@ ación ( letters for reconciliation ) that young people were encouraged to write letters . &quot;
&quot; only recently , her country was in a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace treaty with the guer@@ rilla war F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces in Colombia ) which formed the Schl@@ us@@ point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; internationally , the designation of the Nobel Peace Treaty was considered to be so significant that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel San@@ tos was awarded for his merits for the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; but before the Colom@@ bian , it is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; guer@@ rilla warfare , who have lived many years in illegal compounds , were exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carried out their weapons around the clock , have to integrate themselves again into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society in turn , which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guer@@ rilla warfare , must now engage in its ranks and support them when building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that young Colom@@ bi@@ ans had to join themselves and would have to help with the integration process .
and that is exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love message to former guer@@ rilla warfare in order to welcome them back in society .
the goal of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former guer@@ rilla offensive that should then be handed over to person .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letter to reconciliation was created on the world summit of Nobel Peace Prize winner who took place in Bogot@@ á in February 2017 . there was Leonardo and Cr@@ istian the opportunity to speak short with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; I explained that we are writing the people we love , on Valentine &apos;s Day , thousands of love letters , but those that need them much unnecessary . &quot;
&quot; he &apos;d plan , he told to share his love with people this year which was most urgent . &quot;
&quot; so the plan , letters of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC to write , who now find their place in society and will have to build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history @-@ story to a common history of peace . &quot;
&quot; so far , more than 2000 letters were collected within the framework of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities Colom@@ bian like Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and Bogot@@ á . &quot;
I would have never thought that someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were passed on 19 March in one of the UN warehouse in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region .
&quot; a group of 40 students at the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation of Bogot@@ a traveled to the camp to get the letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC focused on how they had done before in order to counter the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no prec@@ ep@@ ts , but letters of s@@ ai@@ ded of people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and anything that lies in between , &quot; &quot; told the policy science student Manuela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Govern@@ ors of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience as follows : &quot;
&quot; after we had handed over the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of guer@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ rilla warfare ) saw , I saw a guer@@ rilla warfare that wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to address , because beside him on the bed there was a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ e@@ gran@@ ates , a deadly weapon in the bush . &quot;
&quot; I said it nevertheless , and asked , &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; I answered a letter that someone has written me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hope@@ ful letter .
&quot; never in my life someone has written something so beautiful , so I responded to it . &quot; I suddenly ran the tears of the che@@ eks . &quot;
I embr@@ aced him completely and sat down next to the pom@@ e@@ gran@@ ates .
&quot; maybe he was also the war , I was sorry to be all the years of loyal companion of this fighters , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
the man told me more about his life . he never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of the hunger . I would have never imagined that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
&quot; but now , I know that there is a society out there that is waiting with open arms for us . &quot;
&quot; until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reigns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; to the start @-@ up , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion round . &quot;
the students grew up all grew up as war and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
&quot; therefore the leaders of the F@@ ARC was the history of the organisation , its ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state had grown up to a political party , we can contribute to shaping the society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
&quot; hearing these people who had never heard never heard before and had no electoral law , and recognize that the people I have often seen as Monster and even had learned , even people with beautiful feelings , which were revers@@ ed by their circumstances and environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality in which the land lives , does me sore . &quot;
&quot; but it comfor@@ ted me that all people - including those who killed and so much damage , could teach us something and give a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp at Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bian was rep@@ ell@@ ent that after the dra@@ inage peace would reign .
but that is not the case .
&quot; as long as it exists inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to attack weapons and prot@@ esting for their rights ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC are now putting peace on peace , in a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore we call on all defen@@ ders of peace , whatever race , religion or ideology they belong to - themselves above all those who dream of a land in the war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring victims , as we know from own experience that nothing is easy . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence , many difficulties are im@@ min@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; homo@@ sexual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ ca@@ sian region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
with terror investig@@ ators have experienced the coverage of recent months about the persecution of S@@ ailing men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat posed as a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ try above the LGB@@ T@@ Q community did not arrive only overnight .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what happens in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q law in Ch@@ echn@@ ya have captured the international headlines several months ago , after reports published the dis@@ appearances , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ ash@@ ina in the No@@ wa@@ ja Gas@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , the suspi@@ cious men they took and they moved in secret prisons in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
&quot; when she was grown up , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ echn@@ ya had experienced the gender equality of their country@@ men , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
she was out of fear for her life and ultimately moved to the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I was active as a honorary assistant in a human rights organisation .
one day was told me that anyone needed my help .
&quot; it was a familiar from D@@ ag@@ est@@ an , a Trans@@ wife , who put in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I accepted her without hesitation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , did someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread her everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent it to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents were made by the very W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was just here to show a few shopping cart from the back seat of my car , I heard a men &apos;s voice : &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; when I revol@@ ved , I felt something in my body , but I did nothing . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on the Che@@ chen , &quot; &quot; How long will you honor the family to honor yourself , &quot;
I knew the person not .
&quot; I just know that there was a young man , no 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital again in the hospital again .
apparently some women had everything to get along and started to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had f@@ aded two keys in my right @-@ wing piano .
OC Media : in which ten@@ ths have you been laid - in which the men or the women ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are outdated , there is still my male name dr@@ auf ; but the doctor understood and placed me to the women . &quot;
I am very grateful to him .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time in his office , I got to do it with fear ; it was a mus@@ li@@ ous , a col@@ dest name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he has been respectful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
&quot; in the last February , I got threats . &quot;
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a nightmare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
&quot; the demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that all that was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they posed absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by passing through the streets in Gros@@ ny ; others wanted that I had not changed my sex , that everything was bad , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have bas@@ ins size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family attempt to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still hard for them .
some older people once said my mother on the road .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world not only of your family , but the whole republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a dev@@ out woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she placed a stri@@ ck around the neck .
luckily the neighbours came and they saved them .
&quot; at that time , I had to change the apartment several times a day . &quot;
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later stood under the window a car with sh@@ ado@@ wed shut@@ ters and a Num@@ mer@@ n@@ shield with a 95 .
&quot; once it happened for the third time , it was clear to me that something was lazy . &quot;
my human rights friends read the number@@ ing - it turned out that I was per@@ secuted .
OC Media : how did you flo@@ wn ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help , I left the country , but then something un@@ reliable . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought her to register without me , without notice , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and cast it into the trash .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; right now , when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think about , you &apos;re warmer in security , just because you have left the country ? &quot;
&quot; our people know already , in which hotel you are st@@ agn@@ ant . you even know your room number . &quot;
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine ? !
this was indeed my room number .
OC Media : do you still have in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we do not talk about the gender equality , that is a tab@@ le@@ topic . &quot;
I am still wearing a few traditional k@@ kas@@ hen@@ ian elements .
&quot; so much I wish , I am not able to overcome this sou@@ ther@@ ly barrier . &quot;
&quot; I am always saying that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I actually give me effort to look like the person to look out of her past - so to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : last week I submitted a report in Washington .
for the needed I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke with someone who has saved in Ar@@ gun and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during Ramadan there were no people arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait , and he didn &apos;t shut out a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; for that I mean , they probably load the relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand an evidence that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; has experienced by blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are also f@@ ading men in these secret prisons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there would be not much .
&quot; if , then above all those who have no rich relatives , or who have been dropped by their relatives in order to face Kad@@ y@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are stuck there so that they can present them later than terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say , &quot; &quot; should they be rep@@ lic@@ ated , they will show their bodies on TV and claim , they would have attacked some village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply gone , but specifically sub@@ merged to radic@@ alize . &quot;
OC Media : is this now just a mut@@ ation or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone over the one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after her beard had grown .
there has been nothing new since then .
they simply took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , that person himself was involved when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; until now , however , they were not introduced as ban@@ dits , in fact there were no reports until now . we suspect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; do you know if these per@@ secu@@ tions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people , who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , have already been settled in the past ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I always took my hair off .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think , already in front of 2003 I was already very well known when I lived there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
in Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , back then it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to bring us to the &quot; &quot; civil isation &quot; , &quot; but ultimately back to the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is that possible under the sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my eyeb@@ rows were t@@ opped ; I had colored eyelashes , bore tube jeans and short T@@ ops . &quot;
the Security Ministry of S@@ aria has never curved me just a hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every night , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew of it ; they knew why men , young people , there met . &quot;
we have never been insul@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a phrase : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Sp@@ otte is not over the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to children if they make fun over the sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they just shut their eyes before you , because they believed you are sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never offen@@ ded me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this greeting to worship ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row stood on the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began speaking on mor@@ als . &quot;
&quot; he did not talk about us , but primarily on the behaviour of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , one could feel how people started in the city to change . &quot;
&quot; who had sm@@ iled before and woke up , viewed yourself at once with suspicion . &quot;
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I got back home , I could feel how the situation in the Republic is getting worse . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you now go to ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t con@@ den@@ sed much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US is not much .
&quot; apart from that , I still work as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I communicate with them as a sort of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize teac@@ up , meetings , I examine them to hospital and help them get ess@@ ences . &quot;
I have no pen@@ ny for this .
I discovered these people themselves when I cut off lands .
I am Mus@@ lim@@ a and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is silly .
&quot; so is nature , it has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who want to make you white with foam in front of the mouth , that there are no gay people with them . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ ag@@ est@@ ans have which , the Kab@@ ard@@ ines have what , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet it is - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear what to hear . &quot;
I meet here so many men from the Caucasus .
&quot; many of them - practicing Muslims , who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men . &quot;
&quot; you know , many think about Transi@@ denti@@ ty to men , the men love , and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but this is a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different ways of feeling , to be accurate , different lifestyle settings . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed for my body . &quot;
don &apos;t know if I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I will be so personally here but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase in self @-@ murder within the impover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region is suffering from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty @-@ rate within the native Arab population .
since the last months there has been a strong increase of self @-@ murder .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August back the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ mad Nazi community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the South@@ west of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own help , the in@@ ability for his family to arise , so Ah@@ mad @-@ human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; a video played on YouTube played the moments after he had cro@@ pped herself , fixed . &quot;
&quot; some people managed to clear the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more . &quot;
he died shortly later .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that has occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ mad azi minority , and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights announces that this month , some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - did . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : these were all family fathers , who felt helpl@@ ess and in@@ capable due to the persecution on the part of the Iranian government , helpl@@ ess and in@@ capable to re@@ charge their families and to pursue a safe work . &quot;
Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , in which most of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community , has been resident in Iran , was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult to dispute the native Arab population to share their living . &quot;
&quot; a century ago the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a largely autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy assumed power and 1925 great efforts to end the ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil fields in the oil and gas fields , as well as some of the most sought and most valuable places for agricultural agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population gets little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often the victim of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime den@@ ies systematically jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of roofs , the waters of the Arab regions into the Persian areas where provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie . &quot;
these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation in the region by drying the devast@@ ation and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fisher@@ y and palm @-@ trees industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi young people now rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director for Ko@@ operative , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , announces that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who have a job completed , 55 % completed a secondary school and 45 % completed a university degree . &quot;
systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights activ@@ ist with resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise in the number of self @-@ murder among the young Ah@@ w@@ azi men . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ him@@ i said that particularly the unemployment has become worse , but the reason for this is a combination of a high number of in Ah@@ wa@@ z emerging ethnic per@@ secut@@ ors and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the creation process : &quot;
&quot; since functional and institutions do not pre@@ tend to the Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi movement will be educated in all sectors . &quot;
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to gain their living outside their home Ah@@ wa@@ z .
&quot; there are people who had to change their predec@@ essors and their names to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ azi and to become so attractive because even the Arabic name in the workplace are not tolerated , because the speaking of the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothes . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi must endure , hit human rights activists , before the situation is explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoidable .

why I do not identify myself with femin@@ ism as well as inter@@ sec@@ tional not inter@@ sec@@ tional
detail of a photo . taken by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under CC@@ 0 Creative Commons license .
&quot; the following article is a revised version of the opinion which was published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website , and the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions were expressed . &quot;
they can be read in the comments under the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with Fr@@ ust . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ists .
&quot; for example , that women still earn less money despite the same formation as men . &quot;
&quot; that women are still under strict observation , when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies . &quot;
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women were sooner or later in a variety of areas of life to a smooth roof , and that discrimination based on sex are still moving across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all of this is known and known to me .
I am convinced that I am less and less twice and thre@@ e@@ fold .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet , if I come to talking on skin colour , on racism , on black CIS women , on black women in the LGB@@ T@@ Q community or on black women from the Diaspora , when I mention , in which way we have been physically , mentally and verb@@ ally ab@@ used , both in and outside the feminist movement , to mention many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; but nevertheless , everyone agrees that women - all women should come together to &quot; &quot; raise &quot; &quot; their voices and sing &quot; Kum@@ b@@ aya , my Lord &quot; &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that in addition to sexual violence an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist violence that we are exposed black women at two times .
&quot; or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and suburbs , earn less than white men and women . &quot;
that black girl and girl with a migration background more often the school are referred to as white girls because of obvious integration problems .
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk of migration , domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men , and all men of any skin colour have the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot consider myself as a black woman , in whose centre the white woman stands to take into account in@@ justi@@ ces in their thinking that refers both to the gender and the skin colour of a person . &quot;
I &apos;m exhausted and I am no longer able to fight my belonging in an white @-@ feminist spheres that always rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; she said to her speech in her speech : &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to keep an ideology in which the black woman is a de@@ human@@ ic and margin@@ alized being . &quot;
&quot; I smo@@ ked me to join the group@@ ings , which also by organising our customs and customs , to advance its ego@@ centric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer seek to paraly@@ se white women the importance of over@@ cutting of skin colour and gender . for some of them continue to honor the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to teach them for the better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different revenues a home and diver@@ ge itself from the white femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name . &quot;
I prefer to start releasing myself completely and completely from femin@@ ism that was launched for my dark skin and my status as a woman that is so persistent for a white feminist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
&quot; it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres , which we are created for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana bl@@ ur@@ ism : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing ( e.g. : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves ) that we can defend ourselves in this way , in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical , and even the spiritual elements can be admired . &quot;
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists are immediately calling for separ@@ atism and exclusion after they read these lines I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement of which the black woman is affected .
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women from other cultures , because in this paradigm I exist . &quot;
I will be recognized for my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this paradigm .
&quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment in which my life was neither passed , nor ignored . &quot;
pad@@ del@@ ve against pollution : the mission of a man to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this contribution from To@@ dd Re@@ ub@@ old was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reported in@@ particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement this article will be published again .
&quot; over the past 7 years , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special request by the Kurdistan region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
in this documentation of Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains to us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of the pollution on its church .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river we lost when I was still a child , &quot; Mus@@ a tells . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , construction of dust storms , pollution and un@@ controlled development , lead to a direct water@@ crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Water@@ ke@@ ep@@ Iraq - an affiliate of Water@@ keeper Alliance , which works and works to protect the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a sums up the urgency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water more , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , a documentary film@@ maker and multi@@ medi@@ al journalist , produced , filmed and published . &quot;

Paragu@@ ays Women and her more difficult fight against violence
&quot; a group of women represents &quot; &quot; crying women &quot; &quot; to express their pain on women &apos;s murder in the country and in the region and to show its rejection . &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and converted version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; this article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # consecr@@ ated women ) which reported about violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been modified to protect the persons affected .
&quot; a police comm@@ iss@@ ary said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner who had become violent towards violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of its relationship was a little time passed , and the police said , their statement would be put to the actors , but you could not do any more . &quot;
as a further woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena due for failure to be useful also the acoustic indicator of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez nothing .
a few days later the second woman moved her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; once women re@@ funds , they generally receive no support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases women are also dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women , who admit to be victims of violence , should at all sign in law enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; content bats and Statisti@@ cal 2 Inv@@ isible Mis@@ sions and a legal system , which is nothing more under@@ mm@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , def@@ ective implementation of blows and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are really suspi@@ ci@@ zed , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación , E@@ studios , a social @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various indications and reports that have not even approaches the scale of gender violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
the figures available are however very alar@@ ming .
&quot; in 2015 the district state @-@ state @-@ of 9@@ 600 ads went on for domestic violence by 2015 . at 70 % of it , it was about violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the advertisements in the police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence against peace . here , 86 % of the advertisements were made by women . &quot;
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women told that they were physically abuse , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s Minister , Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on any woman who do not adver@@ t in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , do 9 women who do not do so . &quot;
&quot; any woman who do not reimbur@@ se for physical abuse , come two women who do not do so , &quot; she said at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; as women &apos;s suicide was not a separate crime , the law enforcement agencies can not be adequately documented how many women each year are murdered by their current or former partners . &quot;
alone through August 2016 journalists at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to her estimates , in Paraguay all ten days dies a woman because of violence . &quot;

invisible Mis@@ sions and a legal system that takes nothing
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he ins@@ isted that she called him the name of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she didn &apos;t want that , but then after . this should be rep@@ ent for ever . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer collabor@@ ated with Carlos . but for two years she carried the psychological violence on one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognize the most recognizable : &quot;
I have never thought that I would become the victim of failure .
&quot; when I read earlier about it , I always thought that the only women happened to be sub@@ servi@@ ent , because they dec@@ eive themselves of violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana useless social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
&quot; name without name , she wrote posts on Facebook , in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he isolated it . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos itself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they had fallen so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier . &quot;
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had a certain complic@@ ity in it .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that her former partner is mis@@ used . &quot;
&quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te CRE@@ O ( &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of abuse . &quot;
&quot; in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psych@@ otic abuse .
&quot; her prosperous partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; it carried out a trial against its former partner who developed into an ongoing legal struggle between Paraguay and her homeland , in which it was mainly about money , power and influence of her former partner . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , lack of implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but are not applied . &quot;
&quot; the ad of abuse is a way full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; said Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organization for Women in Paraguay , also provides great problems with the application of laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was deb@@ ated at the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament , who was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # C@@ ote ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the Movement # Ni@@ in@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
&quot; the original design of the law considers , to explain , to explain , to a peculiar criminal off@@ ences , and to pun@@ ish how it is already in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia . &quot;
&quot; thus the legislative text was changed in some points , in order to also win the dep@@ u@@ ties for the law that fear that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions are ruled out in Paraguay basically and can be punished with up to five years . &quot;
&quot; the original bill was intended to cost the bulk of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) procedures that must bear the victims of violence at the present moment , if they just want to reimbur@@ se and receive a safe accommodation . &quot;
echo@@ au@@ ri argued that the law is not effective unless the legis@@ lature has no sufficient financial means available to it :
in Paraguay is mis@@ used as part of inter@@ personal relations .
&quot; here , a re@@ think must take place so that violence is no longer viewed as anything else . &quot;
&quot; in view of these facts , he is innocent , and contributes to the offen@@ ders . &quot;
we have to reimbur@@ se such a long ad until failure is no longer regarded as normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Sen@@ at . previously , parts of the law had been amended , but a passage from which the partners in cases initiated domestic violence to reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions about changes are going apart .
the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; the stri@@ fe of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law shall be considered a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in O@@ man continued to attack the attacks by a newspaper in O@@ man .
&quot; this web site was locked in due to a prime minister of the information of information , &quot; is to read on the homepage of the rejected newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the French authorities have closed an independent Arab @-@ speaking paper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting about corruption in the Sultan . &quot;
&quot; You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he was in prison for one year . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and presented in court , later came again freely . &quot;
&quot; O@@ man has been ruling from Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had set his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a state of State . &quot;
&quot; since then he has been disgu@@ ised , beside his role as the only Sultan , the main offices in the country : Prime Minister , Secretary of Defense , Supreme Command of the Defence Forces , Minister of Minister , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for the Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the reign of the Sultan is lab@@ elled by the ins@@ cr@@ ative efforts of security forces , in particular the domestic secret service , including freedom of press , limiting and human rights defen@@ ders , independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers and other activists , to intimi@@ date and to prison . &quot;
&quot; the authorities discrimin@@ ate peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights systematically and prevent citizens , also activists , to express their views on public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , their closing and detention of three of their editors last year is a hard blow to freedom of the press in the country . &quot;
&quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper which has been reported in O@@ man ( an absolute monarchy ) since its inception in 2007 , until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , announced that in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 , an article entitled &quot; high @-@ level parties &quot; bind hands of the judiciary . &quot; it was about corruption in the judiciary and the intervention of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on the Supreme Court in O@@ man to put pressure in a inheritance . &quot;
&quot; newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of 26 July 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; high @-@ level parties , bind hands of the judiciary . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , he was invited to Al @-@ Abr@@ i , Member of the Board of Directors , from the ISS before the Special Department and was arrested on his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS Deputy Chief Editor @-@ Chief Apostle Al @-@ Ha@@ j took to act as a chief editor at Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is . &quot;
&quot; the paper was closed at an un@@ determined period after the Minister &apos;s Foreign Minister had given the statement that &quot; &quot; the publication and spreading of the newspaper on all ways , including online , from 9 August 2016 forbidden . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first hearing took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
the Court condemned the three journalists to prison terms and orda@@ ined the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned by dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; sub@@ dig@@ ging of the &quot; state of the State . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of the violation of an audience &apos;s ban and de@@ fam@@ ation .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of prison and fin@@ es at the amount of 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
&quot; al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year of prison and a penalty in the amount of 1000 ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) , after making use of the use of a information network , which could pose a threat to the public order &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a b@@ ail was fixed in the amount of 5000 om@@ ani Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the Jud@@ gment of the Jud@@ gment . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ al tribunal said Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , however , condemned Al @-@ Ha@@ j a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months in prison . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after the completion of his six months in prison sentence in mas@@ cara . Al @-@ Ha@@ j continues to be in prison , where he served its one @-@ year prison sentence . &quot;
the Appe@@ als also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; newspaper .
&quot; despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n returns to the newspaper , the newspaper looks like attacks by the Iranian government . &quot;
&quot; on January 8 , the Minister &apos;s Minister issued a statement by which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister &apos;s Foreign Minister has personally signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with which the Minister renewed for a further time against the decision of the decision to permit the publication of the newspaper again . &quot;
&quot; the continuous closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where in O@@ man , the press has recently been injured . &quot;
&quot; other violations include , for example , closing the website of the independent magazine Mo@@ w@@ atin and exercising pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online paper of the country , their operations . &quot;
&quot; due to the continuous closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ ani authorities are still not ready to end up the extensive violation of freedom of the press . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ ani authorities on : &quot;
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediate and un@@ condition@@ ally released ;
to create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3 . protect the press freedom in the country and
&quot; under all circumstances ensuring that human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in O@@ man have imp@@ eded their legitimate human rights and without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including judicial issues . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , the human rights defen@@ ders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighboring countries by promoting the opinion and freedom of freedom and the right to peace@@ fully gather peace@@ fully , providing them protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or 2016 in Zambia takes place with its consent
medical research in Africa is rarely seen or not mentioned in the media . this is an increasing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; for the need , on @-@ site medical research there are two reasons : for a lack of global health care , many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and malaria combined in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research on these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem . &quot;
&quot; second , research , which is conducted by African scientists , in building own research capacity in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or is Director of the centr@@ all@@ ab@@ ors at the Center for exploration of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Sam@@ bia for studying in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself based on HIV virus before he decided to go back home to assist the Sámi system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ or discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understanding of the media about this research . &quot;
( disclaimer : Dr. Warri@@ or speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or RW : at the moment the focus of my work lies on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ic national program for anti @-@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I have just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens . &quot;
G@@ V : what do you think is the most important scientific topics in your country and in general ?
how do they differ from those in western countries ?
r@@ w : there are no basic research here . we only rely solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always stay recei@@ vers instead of being both creators . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not suitable in our surroundings , and sometimes it &apos;s even impossible to use them here . &quot;
G@@ V : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
r@@ w : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are very well supported .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here , because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have ?
r@@ w : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; lab material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; r@@ w : there is interest , but only a limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; G@@ V : how big is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support the development ? &quot;
r@@ w : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of outer space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
G@@ V : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a researcher in Africa over Western countries based on your experience ?
&quot; r@@ w : often , there are limited speed , things to do , and difficult access to scientific expertise that pose challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that journals make articles available only against payment ( the so called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , but also limited the amount of availability information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : like &quot; open source &quot; seed manufacturers to change global food production
&quot; this contribution from Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine , which reports on solutions for environmental problems all around the world . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding in the USA for the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties of , such as Out@@ ra@@ geous , the first plant , which has been grown by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in Space and consumed . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s labour was only set by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many Sal@@ at@@ varieties can get limits . &quot;
&quot; in the early 200@@ 0s , he noted that ever more sal@@ ads were patented , and that he could not continue to use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; patents are not only for individual grades , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green ton or curved leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more and more such patents have been registered on more and more plants such as cereals or cart@@ els . based on these trends , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as passionate representatives of a mill@@ en@@ nia of a mill@@ en@@ nia of mill@@ en@@ nia , Mor@@ ton is getting a salad , but he now needs more , since its work is still further ag@@ grav@@ ated by ever more restrictions . &quot;
it &apos;s as if there are a l@@ ump in a river to which I must turn out .
&quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go far on sal@@ ads . &quot;
&quot; and when they with@@ stand the court , no one can breed a new Sal@@ at@@ ty , because all the features are patented . so he is doing as good as possible and tries to breed those characteristics that he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and strives to use no material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he has also joined in a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world : open source bra@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Mathemati@@ cs ISS have cultivated red tubes in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station &quot; and eaten . there is tested whether plants can be cultivated in the space .

&quot; it is no coincidence that this name seems rather that it sounds like the movement from the IT area , and not from the area of plant breeding . &quot;
&quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which offers alternatives to copyrighted software . &quot;
&quot; it was brought into life to make sure that some plant species and species are not protected as intellectual property , and thus usable for plant breeders . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the initiative , briefly called Os@@ si , US breeders can commit to that others can freely use it freely . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and to sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others to breed their seeds , to breed so their own varieties , and it will not immediately agree - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ents . &quot;
dozens of bre@@ eder and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
&quot; for the em@@ eri@@ ed professor of University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si @-@ board member , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg have control over the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and for environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to him , seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would attempt to use the latter not or only little by bre@@ wed seed with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open source &quot; movement is not busy with genetically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; &quot; to buy our goal of ecological sustainability , the latest examples illustrate the merger of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ santo and Bayer who , for example , are offered on farmers markets , should also know that the way this vegetables is bred . &quot;
&quot; nutrition , without seeds @-@ sovereign , is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative commit themselves to res@@ ign others their seeds as well . thus , its action is to patent in contrast to seeds , seeds and plant @-@ characteristics . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; Os@@ si supporters argued that the future of food supplies is endangered because the available gene pool due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus always more restric@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , Executive director of the Os@@ si , has engaged in her PhD work with a genetic variation with car@@ rots and their availability . it found out that about one @-@ third of all anti@@ body features are protected as intellectual property , making it usable or only usable for plant breeders . &quot;
&quot; for other plants there are such estimates yet not , but experts like Lu@@ by suggests that mass@@ acres cultivated plants like wheat in an even bigger style are patented or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are cultivated as they have targeted characteristics - from such , through which their taste or colour improves until such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and keep threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eder by more and more patents is decl@@ ining . genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since the changing conditions due to climate change are much worse .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail Mon@@ santo spokes@@ person in C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to , that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Mon@@ santo &apos;s activities . with a total of four Gen@@ banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the United States , the company is set up for the preservation of genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradic@@ ts that intellectual property is restric@@ ting other breeders , since &quot; patents and the protection of plant @-@ hazardous innovations . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically taken a plan that everyone can follow once the patent is up . &quot;
&quot; often , these instructions help others to achieve the same result . &quot;
&quot; thus , such protection inhi@@ bits innovation not , but promotes it by providing the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton sees that different : 20 years to wait until a patent is baptism , does not render it any innovation . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait such a long time to breed plants that are adapted to the changing environment conditions , one would have lost the struggle . &quot;
&quot; the main argument for Mor@@ ton is , however , that genetic resources are always been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ th@@ less incentives for us are not attractive . &quot;
we want farmers to facilitate their work .
&quot; this is what motiv@@ ates us , and it will make us impossible if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total Mor@@ ton was not bot@@ her@@ ing to the concept of itself , plant features : &quot; we do not create the characteristics really themselves . &quot;
the plants form them themselves and as bre@@ eder we do not have any idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Carol branch , plant breeding in the U.S. state Oregon and Os@@ si @-@ board member , there is another important aspect of the plant breeding : &quot; &quot; who ch@@ asti@@ fied a variety , also has its own values into it . &quot;
&quot; who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ ok@@ ul@@ tures , for whose cultivation it is necessary for her@@ bi@@ cide , to grow out of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
&quot; my concept is exactly genetically modified . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that are moving on international markets , but smaller than B. Mon@@ santo are ) patents manage to survive the most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they oppose the patent or they stick it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case . &quot;

&quot; Mor@@ ton is also the view that bre@@ eder through the prevention of plant pat@@ ents would be innovative : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than a company , the patent . &quot;
&quot; I need constantly new material for my catalogue as I know that my competitors are being selling my varieties within a couple of years &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent for 20 years , he says . &quot; &quot; with a patent she is very nice to do with my opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; although the US seem to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , but the concept is rapidly spreading throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; in India the centre for sustainable agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the area of resources , a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . to preserve the seed sector , the centre is working with farmers , helping them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements . &quot;
&quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seed , and sell their own . &quot;
&quot; the German organization Agre@@ col is working on an &quot; Open Source &quot; License , which is ultimately a more formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , present because the Os@@ si obligation cannot simply be one of one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; in early November 2016 , the executive committee of the European Union , the European Commission , declares that conventional plants should not be pat@@ enting . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European patent @-@ act , which allowed patents on conven@@ tionally cultivated plants . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is on the governments of the Member States to bring the patent offices to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives from governments , NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa to learn about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; - seed systems , that the organization currently establishes a global alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , for the planned next year of the official start signal . &quot;
&quot; a consortium of environmental protection and development groups ( including hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development aid organization US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has put together a database on seeds and biodiversity worldwide in order to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of the food - a network of aid organizations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - it represents the possibility that farmers have the opportunity to put on seeds and improve the seed policy to ensure that a stable supply of food can be ensured . &quot;
&quot; the report also emphasises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a link , from the Lu@@ by of Os@@ si hopes to recognize him soon more people . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has mostly taken care of where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that even more behind their foods are . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the most recent goals of cens@@ orship in Egypt
&quot; still , the Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet . &quot;
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ nis@@ ts .
&quot; on the weekend around May 5 , the Egyptian Government draws the website of the Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; in August the network published an opinion on Facebook , in which it critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; defending the Network for Human Rights Information abi@@ ding - despite this attack and the mo@@ cking of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities , who must defend the law and to give victims a voice . even though it has never been as difficult as now . AN@@ H@@ RI has never been so important to overcome the freedom of freedom and human rights in the Arab world . we insist that all technical possibilities must be exhausted to overcome the blocking and not im@@ itate our task . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ H@@ RI is considered to be the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities block the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language issue of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar network of Al Jazeera due to the &quot; &quot; support of terrorism &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; # Egypt : first human rights organization of the wave of the web@@ side pl@@ ings to the victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic , htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / N@@ IZ@@ O@@ Op@@ 5@@ K &quot;
&quot; in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI , there is also no access to Egypt &apos;s blog on the blog of the colum@@ nis@@ ts and human rights research scientist Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of colum@@ nis@@ ts and articles , which he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media . &quot;
&quot; now the blog , which he built to deal with the cens@@ ored instrument of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ g@@ gers , who is home to the Chinese blog ( blo@@ g@@ gers ) , on the other hand , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he reported by Egyptian security forces , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video , like the police of physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles are mainly about politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada refers to the blocking of the government and reflected , what this means to him : &quot;
&quot; the blogs to unlock is very old , however , has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fatal th@@ at@@ rop@@ al @-@ S@@ isi &apos;s priority ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , then it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has been able to give me the feeling of an aff@@ ol@@ ation board ; a arrested murder , a attempted murder , pro@@ ach on the national Security Council , the blocking of blogs as well as any other web page , for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You proved that I did not wrote in vain . in other words , my words have an influence , even if only on a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to post the post of articles to get the cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; however , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the mu@@ gs go the way up to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Thou@@ ght and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this took technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , including orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of vendors , which was possible through the relocation of internet access and private surfing , so called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 we noticed how the blocking of web pages which I offer , began . &quot;
&quot; such a practice indicates the intent of the government to block and filter contents , which might have access to the Egyptian users . &quot;
&quot; the situation will additionally be ag@@ grav@@ ated that the cens@@ ored decision had been made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis , using the courts to proceed against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants are argu@@ ing .

&quot; day 1 day newspapers report throughout Brazil with glo@@ omy headlines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous other postcard motives . &quot;
some of these headlines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school &quot; &quot; Je@@ den second day will be murdered by police officer in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; th@@ iev@@ es pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , marine and Air Force . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation , the end of 2017 reached its highest level for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian government of Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports such as these are daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; published for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio well @-@ known newspaper &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; on 16 August the editorial &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; in which they announced , a new section called &quot; war in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper so :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ bery , sex break , etc . everything , however , happened by the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be called &quot; &quot; war in Rio &quot; &quot; : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative to which we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video that was divided on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor @-@ in @-@ Chief of the newspaper , that this decision is not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognise the war at all .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas where criminal organizations are controlled . &quot;
in the editorial the newspaper writes on :
&quot; we are aware that a war circuit , if he is dist@@ orts , even to be used , atrocities of the police that are only sho@@ ots , and then ask questions to conce@@ de . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; s@@ avo@@ ids more than they used ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasi@@ l , the journalist of Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , refer to violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold responsibility in the police to account . &quot;
this is not war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - like extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education , and a historical and self @-@ bog@@ us neglect of public service . &quot;
to remember : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital .

&quot; Rio de Janeiro is &quot; &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data . &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; if we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ aten per federal state , Rio is on position 16 , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; specially belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company of South America , which , like Cec@@ í@@ lia , has been emphasized the security policy of the state for years . &quot;
&quot; these security measures also belonged to the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a massive police system through the use of a massive police officer and a unit permanent there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of bloody death cases . however , for several years , the U@@ PP began to protect more about Shi@@ ps and repression against the poor communities who actually protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his fac@@ ebook @-@ page the journalist João Paulo K@@ le@@ aus from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not match the criteria set by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also draws serious consequences for the people after themselves . &quot;
&quot; for this calls for the state to use the state , means and ways that are typical of a war . to this belongs the penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civil is an un@@ sharp point in the countryside and the object for &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damages &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; wasted balls &quot; . &quot; &quot;
war or her own fact is that the inhabitants of the Fav@@ our@@ al in Rio continues to suffer .
&quot; one week it is now that the police spoke the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ ac ho , to av@@ enge the death of a poli@@ cem@@ an . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all this force , this incident has also been called : a fruit@@ arian died as a result of shots that had fired the police from a helicopter . &quot;

to remain alive : besi@@ eged Sy@@ rer to plant mushrooms
scre@@ enshot from the promotional video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ages , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the pa@@ x and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or , and I@@ d@@ lib currently around one million Syrians in a state of si@@ ege . &quot;
&quot; the region of East G@@ hou@@ ta , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called the life of hundreds of civilians on 21 August 2013 . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume that on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was practi@@ sed by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , the rebels have been controlled by rebels from Damascus under si@@ ege , which led inhabitants to depend on local or through tunnels and control points . &quot;
&quot; thanks to long @-@ term block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat become un@@ at@@ tainable for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and acade@@ mi@@ cians , the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ ta , how they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; &quot; life @-@ saving food source &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to the conventional , planted foods and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , its nutritional value makes it an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the besi@@ eged East G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; directed to the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we chose the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because you can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , has been fighting for this project for three years and expressed its relief that it is now more and more &quot; &quot; popularity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , we use the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ close as the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform in Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge for planting of mushrooms , such as Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of approximately 12.@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect from Can@@ Do until Monday , 04 . September 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is dependent on generators , which hold the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % . &quot;
&quot; due to the fuel shor@@ tages , locally produced fuels will be used in plastic to provide the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , she started with the &quot; &quot; production of fungus @-@ friendly &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom court in a tub . as this managed they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; well , they have designed a &quot; &quot; apprenticeship farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after further 3 months , the Mus@@ h@@ rooms have spread everywhere in the East G@@ hou@@ ta for free . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la declared that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom breeding of various reasons &quot; &quot; : frac@@ ture of the si@@ ege . &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ supply by applying eating remains ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new food . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound to their homes .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the si@@ ege will be visible . &quot;
we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the bre@@ wers of 2017
&quot; several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many bor@@ row cities in Portugal , called for justice for the victims of the fires , which were r@@ amp@@ ant in the week before them in the north of Portugal . &quot;
&quot; forty @-@ two people died , and approximately 70 were injured by the forest fires of October 15 and 16 . this led to the fact that the government came out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state of state . &quot;
fires also were registered in the Gali@@ cia region where there were 4 dead .
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 hot out@@ breaks , spread out in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June occurred in Pedr@@ al@@ g@@ ão Grande , a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European fores@@ try system , the forest @-@ surfaces were monitored by satellite images , only 2017 in Portugal are burned about 500,000 hectares of forest - an area of the size of the district of Lisbon . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation : there is only in 4 districts there is no fire .

the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy
the goal of the protests of the Saturday was the demand for better prev@@ ent@@ ative and fire control measures by the state .
the people asked why the civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
João Sover@@ al from the covenant of the farmers of Portugal explained the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o .
after Pedr@@ al@@ g@@ ão roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
&quot; this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are endless reports of open streets , which were surrounded by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy like in June could happen again since the streets were closed very late . &quot;
furthermore the building permits in Ö@@ r@@ t@@ alities with a high fire risk .
&quot; a broad proposal for the whale @-@ form , which had introduced the government in the years 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ection@@ able by the Commun@@ ists who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the construction activity by case permitted , if the applicant has had an open door door , so that everything could be built , &quot; leads João Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us made aware that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus trees , trees made from slightly burning wood , spread like in a vi@@ cious circle , according to fires of this species . &quot;
&quot; to these problems , the site of the civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when local residents were looking for or trying to contact relatives , was offline . &quot;
&quot; it was a private initiative , which provided the population with information : they used the own civil protection data using the application fo@@ g@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of the fires . &quot;
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developers João P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of fire bri@@ ga@@ des , and on this f@@ ateful weekend in October was decisive that the servers followed the rush of 400@@ ,000 users who were unable to with@@ stand : there was over half a million requests . &quot;

&quot; two years previously , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings who had conquered the short @-@ term pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan was a country of terror and despair . &quot;

&quot; Ab@@ du@@ l Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the von Haz@@ ara dominated Party E@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat was just murdered by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt safe . &quot;
the Taliban on the Haz@@ ara came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape A@@ per@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
he worked in a coal mine for a few years . the work was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; then he took what was left from his low wages , and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and to@@ wing s@@ acks with mor@@ tar , which were he@@ avier than he himself , to make himself a living . &quot;
&quot; at that time , as today , life af@@ gh@@ an refugees was shaped by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; I remembered A@@ carto@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the site , where we also worked . &quot;
&quot; there were no services and no heating there . we hang@@ ed n@@ ylon in front of the open windows , so that we were not freezing at night . &quot;
&quot; after four years , A@@ per@@ af left his life without Pap@@ ers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe . &quot;
&quot; on the dangerous crossing of the sea , he suffered boat departure and stran@@ gled on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities had rejected his asylum application , A@@ ñ@@ af came to Italy . &quot;
&quot; some time was A@@ gar@@ af homeless , running alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day food to aid in need . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for exp@@ ired asylum seekers , but it is also true that the conditions , asylum seekers in the country have to be disastrous . &quot;
the human rights organization Civil liberties Union for Europe writes the system &quot; is suffering from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the great majority of the asylum seekers will be housed in more than 3000 &quot; &quot; special recording centers &quot; . &quot; this involves impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ative staff . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law asylum seekers can only be assigned to a recording centre , once they officially put an application for asylum , which may take place after the registration of asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then are people who have no money for accommodation , either directed to the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it also took A@@ carto@@ af .
&quot; but his un@@ du@@ ous life @-@ lle helped a@@ quar@@ es , to release themselves out of these conditions soon . &quot;
&quot; after spending several years in the construction industry , A@@ ñ@@ af tasted his entire experience in the founding of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a car@@ p .
&quot; A@@ per@@ es Bar@@ atis success story is now subject to the documentation &quot; &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italians - are very difficult .
&quot; a great deal of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to in@@ official estimates about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years some of Afghanistan arose from Afghanistan , including tail@@ oring , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience in which the waiter and the kitchen are mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant is told by the different af@@ gh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes made the history of their trip to Italy . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and an Sus@@ hi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; A@@ per@@ af@@ s &apos;s goals are far beyond the Italian Ga@@ stronom@@ ic industry and the retail sector , and aim to go back to the country which he had to leave as teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ carto@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
&quot; I never forget my country , and I cannot live happily if I know that my people suffer . &quot;
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces in the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as anyone else . &quot;
&quot; A@@ per@@ es also for@@ ge plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , in which people can learn packaging and preserv@@ atives . &quot; &quot; so they can sell their harvesting data on the market and improve their financial situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there are stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ per@@ af has made this journey even . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
&quot; Ne@@ on Report : legislative dis@@ cards from Egypt enable switch @-@ down social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , since more than 900 days in jail . &quot;
&quot; he reported on the clearance of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the overthrow of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

&quot; the Egyptian Parliament checks a bill that is propos@@ ing that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook , just after registering with a government agency . &quot;
&quot; users need to be able to use social networks within six months , within six months of the application of the Authority using their full name and reference number . &quot;
those who neglect this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the en@@ closure of a criminal payment .
&quot; the law , which was applied by sixty parliament@@ arians , is currently the legislative as well as the constitutional Committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of the European Parliament issued a proposal for the har@@ dening of the president or of a high officials . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian law is the insul@@ ting of the President and government institutions already pun@@ is@@ hable . however , under the legal proposal would such a fact be punished with jail and fin@@ es , so right @-@ wing of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be adopted , this may mean up to three years in prison for the shared refer@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate where the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he demonstrated Egyptian poli@@ c@@ emen , whilst advoc@@ ated violence against prot@@ esters that led to the counterpart of the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ ler waited so much more than 700 people who were arrested in the same incident , four years in detention to a trial date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postponed to the 20th of May , because the prisons of human rights groups were sh@@ elled to bring the accused of the prison in the cour@@ tro@@ om . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threatens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , spotlight from among other weapons , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
in another case a criminal tribunal in G@@ iza spoke free to the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indicted for their reporting to pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya place in Cairo .
&quot; the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunisian activists to inter@@ ro@@ gated documents
in May Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ pol@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia which co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project .
Ben @-@ har@@ bia was mainly reli@@ eved in a triumph@@ ed plan of action . the President of the Republic was expressly supported by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali the corruption of accused officer am@@ nesty and provided these all un@@ lawful preserv@@ atives .
&quot; the document published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , sheds light on how the presidential plans to support the legislation will look like . &quot;
Ben @-@ har@@ bia has refused to mention its sources under specification of Article 11 of the Tunisian press code which journalists have the right to protect their sources .
&quot; nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on 09 . may as a witness in the case . &quot;
will China force the users of social media to submit their ID .
&quot; according to new provisions of the Council of the People &apos;s Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users need social media in China before sending or share information in social media . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is indicated that the registration with the full real name will be required . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ st suggests that by eliminating anonymous comments in communication within the social networks , it is still unclear how the authorities apply these rules . &quot;
&quot; Chinese ret@@ ali@@ an citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these regulations , in order to protect citizen journalism and independence . &quot;

&quot; this name is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government manages a list of online services that allow the &quot; publishing of information &quot; to make matters responsible for the removal of content and force them on request for the removal of user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites are currently sites such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ p@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ and the incub@@ ating of other services . &quot;
Turkish dish has blocking Wikipe@@ di@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court ordered the blocking Wikipe@@ di@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the data , Turkey support the jihadists in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication gave that the site was blocked because it is a source of information that works with groups to help a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey is completely blocked by Turkey . it is therefore , next to China , one of the few countries worldwide in which access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Great Britain can not stop her@@ edi@@ ble
&quot; following this week , the government of Britain is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased monitoring powers , which would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install back@@ door programs to en@@ code data encrypted . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted with telecommunications companies and intelligence services concerning the proposal , but also has other technological companies and the civilian population . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until 19 May . reactions and suggestions from the public part of the public can be forwarded to the interior of the Interior Ministry . &quot;
