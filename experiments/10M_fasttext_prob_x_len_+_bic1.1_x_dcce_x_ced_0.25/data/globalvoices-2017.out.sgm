<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US since 2012 at least once a year I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"as many of my generation I have grown up with American movies I have danced with American music, American authors have read and operated his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had a very profound impact on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura-Stued to the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnates who had his interest inclined to occupy."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to Method Man," I was "as if it is absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year that I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only intensified."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country where I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be that you are, and it's easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very warm love-book about its size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as he deals with his dedness."</seg>
<seg id="15">He never holds up behind the mountain with his view how to say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks of how a former colleague put it, and explains publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African American and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted for him in swiss."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes he won in the Republican elections, was the highest number that has ever been nominated by the party's nomination candidate."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans, who support this bigotilla person, I asked me?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the journalist program, who occupies people from around the world, a deeply glorious man, with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Trumps World view not coincided with the present editor of Peter Bhatia, the present editor of" Cincinnati Inquirer "." "</seg>
<seg id="24">"Bhatia and I met us at our common love for basketball, and we spent many hours to watch the" Phoenix Suns "at stake."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps Inintolerance also stands in contrast to the generosity that I experienced during Sandy Bahr, who live their lives long the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">She adapts her to the dedication of Kristi Kappes who helped me with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">"then, there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise counsel helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and their values are embodied down my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump had eased his way to the nominee of Republican presidential data, they offered me a grip and the counterpart to his restricted vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans, usually White, the presidency of a man, despite - or maybe because of his contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the debate with the idea that people have voted for Trump because they either shared its racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, broke me almost the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Maybe it's unfair to call the Trump-voters as a racist.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to arrange people, one of my friends said, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and indicates a inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities will not be considered.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, of which most are white, have voted for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that she disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they perhaps wanted to say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commentated the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different than he."</seg>
<seg id="41">"BTWC. WC. WC.: as much as" "drawing up the White against all the other ethnicities;" "play from white in touch on the whites and whiplash, as called the great Van Jones, has exactly killed what America has done so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether the myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - whatever belief or background you like, America is definitely welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this land chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyman, whose history as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the choice of Donald Trumps, however, a huge part of the White House of America gives this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the Ruder, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"for all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">At a manifestation for Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, could have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" Mr. Khan asked. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd replied with a loud" "No!" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" "brot the quantity."</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latin, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no! they were called, and their voices were louder."</seg>
<seg id="56">"could someone who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a voting and loud "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, is this not your America. "" 36 hours later he was corrected. "</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son fell, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"that is now Trumps Land, said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could not find space in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And it breaks my heart to me.</seg>

<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a big garbage dump, just 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an ancient colonial city, which is popular among tourists but worlds from nearby prehistoric ruins and its world-famous kitchen."</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now La Banda de Música (Music Association) has been playing in the municipality: a Symphony Orchestra in children and adults who have found an opportunity to overcome the surrounding poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A musical school with 100 students is a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its Drug abuse and the gangs of bondage."</seg>
<seg id="77">"however, this changed after a random meeting with a French pilot, who started a musical project and the youth offered a rare hope of hope."</seg>
<seg id="78">The young bandmembers take their obligations to the music group very seriously and writes the local press notcias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">"once they come out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to meet their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"they come always lachingly and with bright eyes and play in the busy you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, flute, forest horn, Pauke, Bongo and the Conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asuncion in Paraguay's capital - on instruments that are made of remixed waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with recurrent instruments that consist of local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura where the recycled led under the direction of Favio Chavez so have begun to transform parts of apostasy."</seg>
<seg id="84">"the instruments imitating Gins, Bratschen, Celli, bass guitars, guitars, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all produced from the rubbish."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire covers classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local economist and musician instructor of the children of Cateura, to the early days:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse, and we had to teach at the same place, when the parents worked in the trash the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something that he had never seen before: a made from waste from the violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments of recurrent material and that is called The recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance on:</seg>

<seg id="99">Republication occurs within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices to share content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was at that time known that this ship had already operated illegally in liberian waters of illegal fishing, before it was the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were over accordingly and little inclined to welcome a pledge of this species on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized themselves rapidly against the ship. they refused to place one of their harbours, and refused to give him a fishing place of fishing."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "urine suddenly was the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply refused", "Benedict Kiilu, a leitmotif of the Kenyan fisheries authority. he is part of a team that discovered the ship at his time and followed."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"in the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to plundering of fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which protects criminal practices and protect resources, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing stop)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"the members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries, which at that time had driven their prime minister out of their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" we have eight countries that are like-minded and working together. they exchange information and stand each other at where it is illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable trust project Ending illegally. this project provides FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is regulated by definition unregulated: what is captured, it is hidden because of it extremely difficult to trace. therefore, illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing from regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"by the deliberate abnormalities of existing laws, by means of which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm the delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"however while actions against illegal fishing they were hindered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail, with the information between individual countries, the actions occur in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, for example, the individual countries can exchange views with each other for example lists, news on suspicious activities or details that can be noticed or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive, if they move around the open sea, using satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this makes it possible to identify the authorities, the ships that fish in botbottled areas - such as such, which suggests that a ship charges its caught fish on the road to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such studies may show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence, where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a criminal ister."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are opposed to illegal fishing are based on this information then refuse the acceptance of such vessels in their ports. what means that the ships will not sell their cargo to their cargo. and that they may even be forced to pay for sanctions, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" it is then about significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worth. "</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, Chairman Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The aforementioned platform was created to attract 20 million USD to lost sales and lose the eight members of the network HISH-i every year due to illegal fishermen who penetrate into East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing plants, whereabouts the region's commercial fishing from all over the world. at this stage, illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="122">"among their practices, among other things, these actions count as the sailing under false flag, counterfeit royalties, indication of fantasies, the fish protected species and the fish in nature conservation areas."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" they specifically use the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-incomplete control system. "" says Long. "" previously, a ship was able to fish illegally and a country could then say "You don't daring my port."</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. 'and precisely this legal nostril tries to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front functions.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception FISH-i was involved in over 30 investigations of suspects.</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has found criminal networks exposed, the fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has persevering ships."</seg>
<seg id="128">"because of its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far to the organised crime "," says Bergh. "</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that is to help FISH-i to make precise ships precise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is always developed further, also helps to track the illegal ships that are happy to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishing use highly refined techniques to hide their activities and their position. and we try to cross-crossed, "says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat tracking, an NGO, which also deals with fishing data and FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships also turn off their automatic identification systems as they can no longer be irritated by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">"Copeland therefore helps to build a system that combines different information levels. it is intended to help FISH-i, criminell ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">One model program</seg>
<seg id="137">"however, FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence the unquestionably global issue of illegal fishing?"</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the marine Protection Organisation Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data, and by which the position of each traceable ship can be displayed worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" meeting with the neighbors to get a better picture of what is what is doing - that is simply meaning "," he says. "" here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global level." "Pew Charitable trusts has a similar project to run in which a global system permits the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities not only felt criminals, but they are also deterred."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships used earlier without a license, and hardly reckoned with consequences, know that they will be observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i countries meanwhile have a 33% increase in fishing sales, since fishing boats purchase more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board locks, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that now we also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "in West Africa, there are several hundred million dollars from illegal fishing each year."</seg>
<seg id="148">"there are six countries joined together in 2015, so called West Africa Task Force. now they are fighting illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "With security, the aim is to let more such initiatives and structures arise in other regions as well," says Copeland. "</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member states recently opened his first major triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship which was on the road under false flag. and not only the ship was also without a license and were used to tow networks, which meanwhile forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also steeped in harbted waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with taking place of measures against Greko 1 put a strong sign that they are against illegal fishing." "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time evidence that such a particular, collaborative way working method works in the entire world sea. Emma Bryce is freelance journalist and lives in London. she writes on the subject of environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"for reasoning, one needs two important skills: passive language skills to understand the starting text and to commit active language skills to get it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that is in the case with native speakers. in general, the conviction that translators are in the target language - should not be in the output language - native speakers."</seg>
<seg id="379">"thus, a French mother language should be translated from English into French, not from the French into English."</seg>

<seg id="381">"a large number of Japanese firms do not employ workers with English as a mother tongue, translation into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of the overlay, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers, who are Japanese to learn."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies who do not have any foreign employees, nevertheless make use of firmer internally. then the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is considered to be the best - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are."</seg>

<seg id="384">Machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the verbs and enigmatic sentences, which are created by machine translation, show that this technology can't replace a human translator for a long time. this applies to some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling prints, often used T-shirts or pockets, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood."</seg>

<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable as jewellery still acceptable or at least harmless. however, by big companies or from the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards, one can expect more careful translation."</seg>

<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian MPs recently voted in a draft law to "the regulations regarding the use and utility of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"when he is accepted by the Parliament, beneficiaries, and users of social media must register in Egypt at a governmental authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law then a position would be set up, which is meant to give citizens a permit to give citizens' social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months, adopting the law would have to register commercial and users on the website of the site with their correct names and personnel numbers to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"will it be reconciled this to do so, this could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a wbuck."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill that consists of six Paragrafen and including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defined social media as" every application, which is running and used over the Internet to communicate with others through voice, video content and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is enforced when the draft does not assume any indication of how Egyptian authorities should be able to impose on the beneficiaries, that the Egyptian government is not currently able to ensure that the Egyptian government is currently unable to uphold regulation on the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, Parliament members and promoters of the statutes, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered commercial drivers and users received a username and a password to get through the firewall, the Facebook blocks."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt is planning to judge a firewall on the national level around Facebook. because of which, it would be necessary for the Egyptians and Egyptians to reach information on their identity to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known so far that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are skeptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German" executive research ") of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German" Egyptian initiative for personal rights "), told Global Voices:"</seg>
<seg id="514">I strongly lack the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, it is so that just as they could easily control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take it seriously, then it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to request citizens who request permission or not. and that means a mad system to monitor the activities of men and also to bring them to a trial process."</seg>
<seg id="517">This is by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed in the legislative and Constitutional committees before it goes into the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether its acceptance and enforcement shall be successful or not, the draft is consistent with a pro-military thought in parliament, in whose sense it will be maximised and safeguarded that there is no dissofter Narration on the screen."</seg>

<seg id="544">"in early March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, which have been achieved for the northeast of Japan, Kahoku Shimpo, the progress made during the last six years have been hit by the" Three-disaster "of March 2011. a huge earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had triggered the disaster."</seg>
<seg id="545">"Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is in the prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was a prefecture of Japan Northeast that had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring prefecture of Fukushima and Iwate were deception because the tsunami had won whole coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">"even more than that, the Fukushima prefecture, even alone, had to leave their homes for 160 000 inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of Kahoku Shimpo shows the progress made six years by the local perspective to re-establish the life of the local resident.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics from the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of those affected by themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"residential construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo Zeitung reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned spare houses (or at the boot, igigai kouei juutaku) were completed in prefecture of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate."</seg>
<seg id="552">"the biggest success among the three prefectures managed by Miyagi, 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has finished 75 percent of such houses, whereas at Fukushima with 70 percent the closing light is light."</seg>
<seg id="554">"however, one still makes every effort to receded also six years after the catastrophe, evacuated of tourist-accommodations (on the part of the course, kasetsu yuutaku) to be settled in final spare houses."</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe almost 80 000 people were forced to live in total-time shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such cases."</seg>
<seg id="557">"almost 40 percent of the evacuation of Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 per cent of the evacuated that were destroyed after the disaster in the shelters, were settled in final houses."</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number is here at 34 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of works and everyday life in the three affected prefecture</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to find out 1074 from 1100 schools, who were affected by harm to December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="561">"six years later, industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="562">"while almost 100 per cent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi have now been in operation at Fukushima only 30 per cent of the fishing ports in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident occurred large in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent of non-destructive agricultural land in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a result of an atomic bomb, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of non-destructive agricultural land of Fukushima, are located in the" nuclear zone "zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered and recovered to Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="567">"tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are back to 90 percent at the same level, as in front of unhappiness. Fukushima cannot show here only 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reported that since the catastrophe almost half of the coast-inhabitants, it seems more difficult to feel their living."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population being prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to find a full picture, the newspaper led numerous surveys under the native population and under the evacuated through. she asked her about the state of rebuilding and also how her rebellion has changed over the tsunami risk."</seg>
<seg id="571">In the introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explained:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey through to bringing more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">"the survey took that 83.1 percent of local residents, measures have taken to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis."</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 percent of those surveyed are still not done enough in disasters."</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In her issue on the anniversary of the earthquake the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung has also strengthened its attention on the position of the evacuation of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had to experience not only the huge earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture of Fukushima was also a witness of the worst, disaster caused, atomic accident, Japan ever had to experience."</seg>
<seg id="578">"of 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were moved outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"in early 2016, a bit more than 23 000 people had been resettled back to Fukushima, in permanent spare houses."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after the date of 2017, there are still 40 000 inhabitants from Fukushima outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the astrophism areas, most of the evacuated areas are still older than 50 years old. they fail to return in proper accommodation, because the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects have to compete. this is projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo."</seg>

<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate on production on the most efficient factories the annual production target amounted to 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only allowed the factories to produce the sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">"the motives, which led to such measures, were the low productivity of the sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis in the world market."</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports of foreign and foreign media about the infamous" "fight against drug trafficking" "in Mexico, the mishes and deceased regularly emerge only in statistics. however, these reflect not the extent of the human tragedy which brings that struggle with itself."</seg>
<seg id="750">"the report about drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, head of the Sinhala-Kartell, supplanted the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looking at the traumas or on the communities who have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"we stand behind every corpse, behind every bone-report in the hundreds of hidden graves, the stories of loose parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds will never heal."</seg>
<seg id="753">"therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal Político launched the digital project" "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" "(German:" "with drug trafficking,") to give these victims a voice and telling stories about people who were united in the fight between law enforcement authorities and cartels.

<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project as follows:</seg>

<seg id="774">"we don't just have to show the faces of those who are afraid of fear. we have to show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the leadership."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some extracts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a lesbian of Animal Político, wrote this article from Taxco, in the State of Guerrero in central Mexico."</seg>

<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">"sometimes I feel as if I am the only, who is disgusted or sad. it acts as a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body."</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">It writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin will think he wants Narco (German: drug dealers) if he is great. and it's also not normal that people listen to songs about the" heroism "of the offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me it is as if they have lost those who have lost someone, and those who fear that they may have something like that."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories are to be mere numbers in a statistics.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the insomnia of the people is incredibly responsible for me, if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbor should be justified by the fact that they were" sässig. ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to persuade that they are spared by such tragedies when they are not stirring and silent.</seg>

<seg id="798">"I asked myself in these terrible days if crying out my deep-rooted feelings, but the answers is no, because I forgot how to live cries. I have to learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the post "Forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: one of violence recorded by force.</seg>
<seg id="800">"in the introduction, he raises questions on how: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?"</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a guard and he tells that he himself needed to teach himself how to cook a egg, potatoes, tortillas warm, and" Chichi "for the babies to live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the vial of water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">"but they are insignificant, compared to the pain in his eyes - inexpressible for a boy who consists of violence and had to learn to live with it."</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood has been past two years earlier, when he only saw a few blocks from his home, the bloody body of his father saw, who was shot by armed men out of a squad car."</seg>
<seg id="809">As Bryan was born the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murder on public security and government of the United States Government."</seg>
<seg id="812">Alone in 2010 the Prosecutor's Office 3103 Morde. this corresponds to the cut 8.5 Morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just some of the hundreds of thousands of thousands who leaves the organized crime in Mexico and invade the soul into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">But few stories are living on the face of ever new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco, "Animal Político 2015 has launched the Datatnalism-project Narcodata, whose aim consists of portraying the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has been tormented over the country in the last four decades."</seg>

<seg id="823">But it also raises questions about our desire for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a petrol station crossed the place Sange in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, kippte and exploded. here, 230 people came to live."</seg>

<seg id="835">"over the years, the same photo was applied several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and mistakenly did not apply to the tragedies, especially in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>

<seg id="1205">"a leading Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in extending access to the internet and knowledge for the public in Syria."</seg>

<seg id="1207">"perhaps none of the basing cultural prototypes foresees as the work, which he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra."</seg>

<seg id="1209">"bassel could not yet know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put it all about it, this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">"this strip-train into the digital archeology and conservation has created a time-capsule, which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future."</seg>

<seg id="1218">Basle opened me the door to technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>

<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts out of the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word still is being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people ostindian origins or generally use as an adjective."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or" "spinning" "and" "on the part of" "(in Burmese writing) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise of radical nationalistic movements of the word has given an extremely abovable connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">"specifically, it is a word that most often uses ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful contents on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar's might not be associated with racism today, but the word itself is not calling non-hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also Posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed to their use."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"furthermore there are several burial words with the different meanings, which have the same letter as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair on Burmese also written 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar Pae' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooker Aung Kadung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A mail to one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he had asked his friends in a spiritual way whether he knew how to relieve his back pain by making a word of words."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the set ku la -" "healing" "(ku) + the fragment (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"in Win is the opinion that they will reduce hate speech, radical national ists, also emphasised that Facebook must be analytic before it can spread all Posts that may spread in suspicion against racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism is not understood what you write on Facentook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should instead, is the post to analyze carefully and control it by checking the next words."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example," Kalar Htine "(chair) and" "Kalar Pae". ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that these three-legged nationalists spread, spread a rather good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to cut their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the promotion may send a strong signal to everyone, disseminating hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy will not stop long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat is proved that the censorship of keywords often becomes a katz- and mouse game, whereby users use social networks simply to use a new word or write an alternative spelling of the word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author of Aung Kadung Myat described, as Facebook, began to clear his posts, as he wanted to communicate his friends only that the word 'Kalar' from the social network is banished:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I became aware of this new directive on Facebook, I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post office was removed from Facebook and was forbidden by the Lives, posts and parts of content for 24 hours, because the post" "Facebook community standards not dismissed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts of people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against hate speech and radicalism.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed that has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are poor in the country."</seg>

<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">To censor such words will only bring more hatred inside the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"furthermore, it seems that without local context or technical support, and so words like" "chair" "or" "pevercurry" "have banned."</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they have made mistakes, they tried not to correct the overshadowed poet."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they would only have a little more respect for the 15 million benefits, they would give them a big turnover, would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has provided a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now become funny about Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech, to see if their Posts are removed from the net."</seg>

<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticized for his failure to put hate speech on his Burmese sides under control.</seg>

<seg id="1469">"this entry was written by Kayonaaz and was originally written on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization in India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version has been published here as a part of a content-sharing convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, women are avoiding the greatest care to speak the name of their husbands or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">"instead, they use a pronouns or say" father of my child. ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh for women to respect the husband, as well as fear of the consequences, they should disregard the norm to maintain this practice alive."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto was judged from the Indian state Odisha by a sword, and by its family and the village community, after having addressed a married relatives with his name."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of their wives, likewise not called by name, is also widespread in men. however, they have far fewer riadmissions to fear, if at all, they should not come up with this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health workers, as well as housewives, a unique club and were therefore quickly becoming the main table theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">"it is a place for them alone, where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1478">"one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal who is operated by the community of Video Volunteers and advocates the dismantling of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pawas working for seven years with the help of her video camera at the uncovering of practices, such as children's heating up to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and leads these clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs created a safe place for those women and at the same time have made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini in her discussion showed that women did not name their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem that women can easily identify with.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"speaking to the name of their husbands, a Brother, which they gave to all obligations, and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini writes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">Tradition testified that a woman is respected her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who does not keep this in, is regarded as a woman without morality."</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never have thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning Rohini, who had never named her husband had never called on behalf of his husband, to try out at home as it was running."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion on her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini said:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-in-law and my husband have been silent for a long time after the video was finished.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should call him by name at his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage Rohini began her first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" patriarchy "before. some felt that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection the women are trying to get the discussion with an exercise in motion.</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different emotions - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked all," If we cannot say the name of our husbands, but they can tell us how they want it, does it mean that they do not respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the breaking of a centuries-old tradition, in the married women never declared the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini said:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy that she only kicked her throughout the exercise, and another decided that the whole austrite frustration turned his frustration against him and his family by curbing it."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"in the adrenalin rush about it, having broken down with an ancient broker, the women decided that they would actually try to name their husbands in the name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days Rohini has received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a wife called Rohini and asked what ideas they put to the women in his head: his wife could not stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it with dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"as her mother-in-law she was staring, she was afraid and said that there was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," Rohini said I had to do it. "</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in the event was less understanding and the situation arded in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the cinoberred point on the forehead, which shows the Ehestatus:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why only women must show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would carry the cinoberred spot if he did it."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He was eighth only and I listened to him to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women ceased to have ceased, but they think they are in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it in some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make a trip with each discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want the women to worry about who could hear," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">During the last months they celebrated their own birthdays in their life with cake. they danced and cheeks and spoke about things that they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years, and yet I have also talked about some things such as our identities on our husbands are not yet spoken."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have been carried only saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most it is okay, but some wanted a Salwar-Kurta, a wide shirt over a trousers; they did not trust."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much argument and discussion about the merits of their own clothes-election, morals joined with the Saris and much more, smuggling Rohini in a panel discussion, so that the women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they have now decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans, and Rohini is certain that they will succeed."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"to the question, whether in the five months have changed something since their first discussion, Rohini confirmed that things will slowly come into roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have taken only small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then again we listened to the name of her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including myself, do it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two will continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now carry Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"the women in the discussion know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggle for more freedom of movement, or their own clothes-choice - at the end of a difficult to navigated river."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"giving each other self confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting on the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How to explain the Rohini:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Every one of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction, if every woman goes home in the club and told other people about what we are talking about and what we do."</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">"the correspondents of the Video Volunteers community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories, which is not reported."</seg>
<seg id="1545">"these stories are" messages of those who experience themselves "," and offer a hyperlocal context to report on global human rights and development. "</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem silly as Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam should be considered in Singapore as a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting at a meeting of the international branch of the Lawyers Association of the State of New York, the Ministers alleged that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they are compared to Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">No one has questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is the most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the Blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice," turning the logic to defend the existing authorized practice of power in Singapore. "</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, according to all our efforts and sacrificiencies that create valuable land, you can say that we are ultimately no land."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the semblance of escape from the responsibilities, a mandatory violation."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons given by Shanmugam were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other" normal countries, "in view of what he inevitably appeared undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore would be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"once you reach the theme of the topic, the good old morer emerges from the authoritarian feasts to be pretentious, leaving the twisted logic, since they fit better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end of the final week of Shanmugam, they were given answers to their American guests regarding our press, our country-dictative, our political system really non-responses."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He unresolved these issues with non-responses of rational manner.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to make his opinion clear as it did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"Singapore is not a country, but a city is, so to which country belongs to our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">Shortly. I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our precious K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clear this point, unless it was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"announcing his comment on the blog, he points out regarding critiques to read the entire transcript of the conference so that one could better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and no land."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"he said that Singapore is more" "city" "than a country," he explained why the elections in Singapore would be so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He experienced Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"he said," "Singapore" "is not a country," he obviously does not mean it in this sense! "</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is the leader of a new generation, a polemical statement."</seg>
<seg id="1715">"I am over what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said, very embarrassed..."</seg>
<seg id="1716">"I didn't know with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expect - do I agree with them or not, but this is another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore, I have doubts, and I am not even sure if he really believes that he is really interested and aware of what he defends."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek review complies the weaknesses of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"did Mr Shanmugam" "blessed an error" "or was it a Freudian leader?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are only considered to be an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, which country goes back to Singapore's sovereign rights?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique; it is a land and a city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"since he plays an important role within the government, the statements of Mr Shanmugam are of serious importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the Singapur come to its military service, defend it only their city but not their land?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Whom must our Prime Minister pay bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink human resource type?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"the magazine Journey of a Decade to Bejahung, Singapore is and has always been a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I have not told what I said,"</seg>
<seg id="1730">This phrase seems to have been annoyed many Singapur...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We always were a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements such as" "the defense of the country especially" "etc., but this is not quite true."</seg>

<seg id="1898">"across the way of migrants, across Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I visited one of these places in the mexican city of Tapesula, it is located on the border to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is managed by a 59- year-old Mexianerin, a small woman with a corals-pink brightly and gold-colored ear rings in teddy bears form."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"it is called Concepción González Ramírez, and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name of Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a goal for Africans and sharks that are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for approximately 2.50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms, with high-storey walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for a hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haitian immigrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez, the people say in full-buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call:" Mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you in Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some also have already slept on cardboard."</seg>
<seg id="1912">It does not want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to hospital when they are sick, they buy them medications that they cannot pay, they mashed them with a balsam, exhausted by the long journey exhausted."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, is arrived in a short time ago."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him whether mother Africa is an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">"Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui, who has a stache) posing with Concepción González Ramírez."</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Brpack.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes" "he answers with a smile." I really feel that it suits her, because African women are very nice women. "</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very lovingly.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move towards north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a well known name on the track, "says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">"he tells that the Haitian and the Africans often travel the route, and that the Africans already speak to Whatsapp of Ms Ramírez."</seg>
<seg id="1927">"as many of his companion, Michelet lived in Brazil previously and worked as a construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Football Championship."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he has started his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tikal.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him whether he will have contact with Mrs Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our Mother and we never leave them again," "he answers smiling." "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs Ramírez tells that their guests often send text messages when they went away to grind them or to report it over the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith in the drive of her work is.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she does not know much about Africa, but their guests have taught her to cook the chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known, but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants to travel through tapeula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the town, a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family have absorbed migrants in their little house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">It is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"there are 25 people there, mainly Haitian."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on blankets on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"Valencia explains that he knows, what the guests do through."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he tells. "I have experienced what they experience."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border across the desert and we have suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived for three years, he was rejected by a raid on his work place from the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants that travels through Tapesula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their houses for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez told me that he is fled to people in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to suppress money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapesula he asked for accommodation and a unknown, a single-one, has offered him their roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family lives still there and she tried to decide where the next steps should go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the corridors the passengers always consult their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs. Ramírez seems happy to have her house full, but she is also nostalgically because of those who went away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother they feed it in their album with a lot of photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hairdraught that she has made a customer, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and Old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sad while she preasked her briefly.</seg>

<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, a ethnic minority region in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on 10 July, the mobile users at the Tianshan District of the City of Urumqi was given a mobile notification in which it indicates the district government, a surveillance app called Jingwang (or" "Web cleaning"). "</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the message, the app will be encouraged to access terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"but, however, the authorities use the app for more than the fight against terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the Autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because they had installed the app, had replaced news with a private white chat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"in the communication of the police, the app was able to determine the sources and distribution paths of terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, pictures, books and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">"Jingwang is a shelter with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is the blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojan and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and to control their home network remotely."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these features can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" "remote control" "government actors or even hacker can manipulate the home network of a person or steal it."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while reports about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often grimmer for those who live in remote, pressing ethnic minority regions, such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"to limit riots and discontent in the conflict-areas, the authorities often arrange extreme Censored and monitoring measures as well as routinous internet deactivations."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the media Outlet Media Outlet" Images from Mainland China "(or" "spinning" "on the part of the net" "), that published messages in China, showed photos from a checkpoint, at the policemen acquired the inhabitants randomly as if they had installed the surveillance app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjiano make sure people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile alert required people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are interested in a checkpoint with a device without these software, it could be detained by up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for the technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">"you have the people forced to use devices, which are intended for elderly people."</seg>

<seg id="1985">"after installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones are available in Xinjiang on electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">"in Jingwang, the rules in Jingwang are potentially a response to the instructions of the City Council, to minimize the dissemination of illegal content."</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, authorities and the associated facilities, including universities and research institutions are obligated to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office during operation of their computers and communication devices."</seg>

<seg id="2090">"the Jordan Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he loosed to his canvas, time to his computer, and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine to discover lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives on the top floor of his family house, which had heard them since 1967; the year in which Israel had completed its occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs family had been forced to escape from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as felahyees (e.g.: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years Hdaib has been an impassioned activist who faces the conservative majority, asking her old proven opinions on gender roles, sexuality, and freedom of expression through art and raph music."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music that deals often with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, but also calls on the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues do not only find in his hometown Amman relevance, but also in cities that will vary from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as a person who is not restricted by boundaries in his mind, and he can have his own statement by the people who suffer the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not exist openly, it swept up against the US foreign policy a special exhaust."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib believes that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones, to do anything with his identity as a" Palestinian struggle "of the second generation," even if he was born in Jordan, and has never been in Palestine. "</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own living circumstances," says Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I am a man, while in water deleted Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan. at this time it is intended for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset. "</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Israeli law also states that public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking down the ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a vertically hot junitag has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the sludge of warm coffee and the waverge of the Kent cigarette is in the nose first and foremost of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially if one has a look to the neighboring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore it is easy to do basic things - as to drink in public during the Ramadan water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently the Interior Ministry of Jordan introduced a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentary MPs that support the Islamic Action front - the jordan branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontrunner Hamed Sinno to resist the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert-telling.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the MP and former press spokesperson in the Islamic coalition of DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that said the concert" "just" "because of the sexual orientation of the singer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim to be the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world, be more dangerous activism that questioned the established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement Mashrou'Leila preached the jordal people as" "progressive supporter of human rights", "which continued to work for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement probably seems to be not simply silverted rhetoric, but actually an increasingly clear crystallizing reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib traditional gender is to be suffering because he formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the image shows the skeleton of an apparently crushed woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red sea, perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"over the past few years, the number of" Honorary tomorrow "has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of Honorary tomorrow reached its peak; however, Jordan was still missing that Jordan was missing the institutional infrastructure to support the women who tried victims of murder and home violence, to provide adequate manner."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law for Crime fighting from 1954 that women, which are exposed to inwardly violence," indefinite time in prison, and for their release is often necessary for years of bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee by the family that the woman has nothing to happen. "</seg>
<seg id="2122">"Hdaibs Music enjoys great popularity, and is known for it, not even before subjects, which in his country is long as tabby."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, however, that he is doing his music, the full explicit anchoring to sexuality, freedom and expression, not separate from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"I was troubled," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes on the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lavla al 3aib" and in "ghoeb," the focus is on poverty. "</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of the songs that are political in the core, can be continued."</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated many times:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, in which one, in his words," can get what you want "- be it faith or non-belief, Hetero- or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + -individuals were strongly censored by 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular jordan online program Roya to remember that his comments from the context were demolished, rotated and his opinion were censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was loaded without cuts, but not only a converted version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib buys the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals do not speak to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentioned Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who still remained in memory today thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks yourself: if Abu Nuwhat if later on behalf of the calibration should work, in the eighth century openly about homosexuality could be able, why can the Jordanier not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the Hashemite Kingdom, there is nothing new that the government bonds attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive votes will be silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the British intelligence service held several former government members and members of the association agreement, with the rationale, they expressed themselves critically on the problems that are deeply rooted in the land deeply rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of what is the concert of Hdaibs, according to that only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to change a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanier."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him progress is a continuous giving and taking. Jordan, Mashrou'Leila has now been delayed for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - it looks like Hdaib - consists of slow, thanking and inner changes. it is certain that these changes take place from day to day at the heart of the Nigerian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"finally, Hdaib dreaming, like millions of other Arabs, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he dreams not only dreamt of his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region with the help of music, art and literature will become a real and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, spreading unition and artificial way of guided democracies. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until that time, Hdaib will continue to downstream and thus can also resist."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"this report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, the Aman as a student Fellow."</seg>

<seg id="2150">These great, extravagant warriors are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the fog festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"thought that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival that is usually recorded in August in many areas of Tohocus. another theory asserted that the marsh, the drums and dancing over more than a thousand years were taken away, in the armies from West Japan to the northeast, to force the indigenous people of the region, the Emishi, into the knees."</seg>

<seg id="2171">"the trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Brazil), has led to getting more and more ordinary citizens in the experienced hands of hairdressers which can form these elaborate hairstyles."</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: love Letters to guerrilla warfare</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"the following article is the published version of the paper" "love message" "guerrilla warfare, which has published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve."</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not yet much more important, people who feel free to face affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this question was about the two young Colombian activists of Leonardo Párraga, of the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios of the Young-Youth Foundation, and inspired it to write letters to the campaign Cartas por la Reverliación (letters for reconciliation) that young people were encouraged to write letters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, her country was in a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had closed a peace treaty with the guerrilla war FARC (German: revolutionary forces in Colombia) which formed the Schluspoint of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"internationally, the designation of the Nobel Peace Treaty was considered to be so significant that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos was awarded for his merits for the Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"but before the Colombian, it is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla warfare, who have lived many years in illegal compounds, were exposed to war rhetoric and carried out their weapons around the clock, have to integrate themselves again into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society in turn, which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guerrilla warfare, must now engage in its ranks and support them when building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that young Colombians had to join themselves and would have to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that is exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love message to former guerrilla warfare in order to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla offensive that should then be handed over to person.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letter to reconciliation was created on the world summit of Nobel Peace Prize winner who took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there was Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to speak short with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"I explained that we are writing the people we love, on Valentine's Day, thousands of love letters, but those that need them much unnecessary."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he'd plan, he told to share his love with people this year which was most urgent."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"so the plan, letters of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC to write, who now find their place in society and will have to build a new life." the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history-story to a common history of peace. "</seg>
<seg id="2199">"so far, more than 2000 letters were collected within the framework of the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities Colombian like Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I would have never thought that someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were passed on 19 March in one of the UN warehouse in the Caldono-Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students at the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation of Bogota traveled to the camp to get the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC focused on how they had done before in order to counter the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no precepts, but letters of saided of people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for all involved." "it's incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and anything that lies in between," "told the policy science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governors of the Province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we had handed over the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of guerilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" "Cambuches" "(a kind of hut in which the guerrilla warfare) saw, I saw a guerrilla warfare that wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to address, because beside him on the bed there was a MGL-pomegranates, a deadly weapon in the bush."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"I said it nevertheless, and asked," "Hello, what do they do?" "he answered," I answered a letter that someone has written me. "</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life someone has written something so beautiful, so I responded to it." I suddenly ran the tears of the cheeks. "</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him completely and sat down next to the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"maybe he was also the war, I was sorry to be all the years of loyal companion of this fighters, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of the hunger. I would have never imagined that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now, I know that there is a society out there that is waiting with open arms for us."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"to the start-up, students and some leaders of the FARC came together to a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students grew up all grew up as war and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore the leaders of the FARC was the history of the organisation, its ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state had grown up to a political party, we can contribute to shaping the society in this country. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a goal of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," said one of them. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"hearing these people who had never heard never heard before and had no electoral law, and recognize that the people I have often seen as Monster and even had learned, even people with beautiful feelings, which were reversed by their circumstances and environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality in which the land lives, does me sore."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforted me that all people - including those who killed and so much damage, could teach us something and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the commander of the camp at Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was repellent that after the drainage peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as it exists inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to attack weapons and protesting for their rights (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC are now putting peace on peace, in a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore we call on all defenders of peace, whatever race, religion or ideology they belong to - themselves above all those who dream of a land in the war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring victims, as we know from own experience that nothing is easy. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence, many difficulties are imminent."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2248">"the first report was published by the journalist Elena Milashina in the Nowaja Gaseta; she cast a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities, the suspicious men they took and they moved in secret prisons in Argun."</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you have brought a monster to the world"</seg>

<seg id="2251">Since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she was grown up, you became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, why she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Chechnya had experienced the gender equality of their countrymen, the hunt was opened on Sabrina."</seg>
<seg id="2254">She was out of fear for her life and ultimately moved to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was active as a honorary assistant in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day was told me that anyone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a familiar from Dagestan, a Transwife, who put in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I accepted her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, did someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread her everywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent it to his Chechen friends, with the following message:" then there are no men more in Chechnya that can eliminate this shame?

<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos of my documents were made by the very WhatsApp."</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>

<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she placed a strick around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbours came and they saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"at that time, I had to change the apartment several times a day."</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later stood under the window a car with shadowed shutters and a Nummernshield with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"once it happened for the third time, it was clear to me that something was lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends read the numbering - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flown?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons, I don't want to give up their names but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with their help, I left the country, but then something unreliable."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought her to register without me, without notice, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"right now, when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" you don't think about, you're warmer in security, just because you have left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">"our people know already, in which hotel you are stagnant. you even know your room number."</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was indeed my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still have in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we do not talk about the gender equality, that is a tabletopic."</seg>
<seg id="2316">I am still wearing a few traditional kkashenian elements.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"so much I wish, I am not able to overcome this southerly barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I am always saying that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I actually give me effort to look like the person to look out of her past - so to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed there?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: last week I submitted a report in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the needed I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke with someone who has saved in Argun and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan there were no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he didn't shut out a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"for that I mean, they probably load the relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand an evidence that the so-called" honour "has experienced by blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are also fading men in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there would be not much.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then above all those who have no rich relatives, or who have been dropped by their relatives in order to face Kadyrows."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are stuck there so that they can present them later than terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say," "should they be replicated, they will show their bodies on TV and claim, they would have attacked some village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply gone, but specifically submerged to radicalize."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now just a mutation or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone over the one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after her beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, that person himself was involved when these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, however, they were not introduced as bandits, in fact there were no reports until now. we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would you not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people, who belong to a so-called" non-traditional "orientation, have already been settled in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always took my hair off.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think, already in front of 2003 I was already very well known when I lived there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was considered, I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, back then it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to bring us to the" "civil isation", "but ultimately back to the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is that possible under the sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were topped; I had colored eyelashes, bore tube jeans and short Tops. "</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Security Ministry of Saria has never curved me just a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every night, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew of it; they knew why men, young people, there met."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a phrase: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Spotte is not over the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children if they make fun over the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just shut their eyes before you, because they believed you are sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never offended me, never hunted and never beaten. "</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this greeting to worship?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow stood on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began speaking on morals."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not talk about us, but primarily on the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, one could feel how people started in the city to change."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who had smiled before and woke up, viewed yourself at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I got back home, I could feel how the situation in the Republic is getting worse."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you now go to?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't condensed much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US is not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I still work as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">"currently, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women."</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a sort of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teacup, meetings, I examine them to hospital and help them get essences."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no penny for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people themselves when I cut off lands.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslima and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so is nature, it has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechnya, who want to make you white with foam in front of the mouth, that there are no gay people with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have which, the Kabardines have what, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet it is - but" not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear what to hear."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">"many of them - practicing Muslims, who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men."</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think about Transidentity to men, the men love, and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences. but this is a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different ways of feeling, to be accurate, different lifestyle settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">"for me, it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed for my body."</seg>
<seg id="2392">Don't know if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I will be so personally here but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region is suffering from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty-rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last months there has been a strong increase of self-murder.</seg>

<seg id="2400">"the self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on 27 August back the desperate situation of the Arab Ahmad Nazi community in Iran, which is shaped by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the Southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own help, the inability for his family to arise, so Ahmad-human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">"a video played on YouTube played the moments after he had cropped herself, fixed."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"some people managed to clear the flames, and Moramazi was brought into the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide that has occurred in August within the Arab Ahmad azi minority, and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take life."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announces that this month, some other - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - did."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have one thing in common: these were all family fathers, who felt helpless and incapable due to the persecution on the part of the Iranian government, helpless and incapable to recharge their families and to pursue a safe work."</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination "</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region, in which most of the Arab Ahwazi community, has been resident in Iran, was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult to dispute the native Arab population to share their living."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago the Arab Ahwaz was a largely autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and 1925 great efforts to end the ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil fields in the oil and gas fields, as well as some of the most sought and most valuable places for agricultural agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population gets little of this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often the victim of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime denies systematically jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industry."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government has also built a variety of roofs, the waters of the Arab regions into the Persian areas where provinces Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie."</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to worsen the devastation in the region by drying the devastation and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fishery and palm-trees industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi young people now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian General Director for Kooperative, Labour and Social Welfare, announces that 5% of the Ahwazis who have a job completed, 55% completed a secondary school and 45% completed a university degree."</seg>

<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist with resident in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of" poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination, "leads to a" high rise in the number of self-murder among the young Ahwazi men. "</seg>
<seg id="2423">"Dohimi said that particularly the unemployment has become worse, but the reason for this is a combination of a high number of in Ahwaz emerging ethnic persecutors and an anti-Arab discrimination in the creation process:"</seg>
<seg id="2424">"since functional and institutions do not pretend to the Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi movement will be educated in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to gain their living outside their home Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their predecessors and their names to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi and to become so attractive because even the Arabic name in the workplace are not tolerated, because the speaking of the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothes."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi must endure, hit human rights activists, before the situation is explosive."</seg>

<seg id="2433">Why I do not identify myself with feminism as well as intersectional not intersectional</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. taken by: Pixabay. published under CC0 Creative Commons license.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"the following article is a revised version of the opinion which was published by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the Afroféminas website, and the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions were expressed."</seg>
<seg id="2436">They can be read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - with Frust."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we generally should be all feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, that women still earn less money despite the same formation as men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">"that women are still under strict observation, when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies."</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women were sooner or later in a variety of areas of life to a smooth roof, and that discrimination based on sex are still moving across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is known and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that I am less and less twice and threefold.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet, if I come to talking on skin colour, on racism, on black CIS women, on black women in the LGBTQ community or on black women from the Diaspora, when I mention, in which way we have been physically, mentally and verbally abused, both in and outside the feminist movement, to mention many white feminists and white intersectional feminists."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"but nevertheless, everyone agrees that women - all women should come together to" "raise" "their voices and sing" Kumbaya, my Lord "" to achieve equal rights (some) of women. "</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about that in addition to sexual violence an institutionalized form of racist violence that we are exposed black women at two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">"or that black women and women of other ethnicities and suburbs, earn less than white men and women."</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girl and girl with a migration background more often the school are referred to as white girls because of obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk of migration, domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all men, and all men of any skin colour have the same rights; on the other hand, I cannot consider myself as a black woman, in whose centre the white woman stands to take into account injustices in their thinking that refers both to the gender and the skin colour of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I'm exhausted and I am no longer able to fight my belonging in an white-feminist spheres that always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"she said to her speech in her speech:" "I am not a woman?" "and I also refuse to keep an ideology in which the black woman is a dehumanic and marginalized being."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I smoked me to join the groupings, which also by organising our customs and customs, to advance its egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer seek to paralyse white women the importance of overcutting of skin colour and gender. for some of them continue to honor the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to teach them for the better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different revenues a home and diverge itself from the white feminism, is still the word" feminism "in his name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to start releasing myself completely and completely from feminism that was launched for my dark skin and my status as a woman that is so persistent for a white feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">"it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres, which we are created for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana blurism: Reclaiming (e.g.: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves) that we can defend ourselves in this way, in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, psychological, physical, and even the spiritual elements can be admired."</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists are immediately calling for separatism and exclusion after they read these lines I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women from other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized for my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment in which my life was neither passed, nor ignored."</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most names have been modified to protect the persons affected.</seg>

<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman moved her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"once women refunds, they generally receive no support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases women are also dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women, who admit to be victims of violence, should at all sign in law enforcement authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"content bats and Statistical 2 Invisible Missions and a legal system, which is nothing more undermmt3 Paraguays laws: good approach, defective implementation of blows and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women are really suspicized, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación, Estudios, a social-scientific research institution in Paraguay." there are various indications and reports that have not even approaches the scale of gender violence against women in Paraguay. "</seg>
<seg id="2491">The figures available are however very alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015 the district state-state-of 9600 ads went on for domestic violence by 2015. at 70% of it, it was about violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the advertisements in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence against peace. here, 86% of the advertisements were made by women."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads, 40% of women told that they were physically abuse, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the paraguayan women's Minister, Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown." on any woman who do not advert in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, do 9 women who do not do so. "</seg>
<seg id="2498">"any woman who do not reimburse for physical abuse, come two women who do not do so," she said at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"as women's suicide was not a separate crime, the law enforcement agencies can not be adequately documented how many women each year are murdered by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">Alone through August 2016 journalists at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>

<seg id="2508">I have never thought that I would become the victim of failure.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read earlier about it, I always thought that the only women happened to be subservient, because they deceive themselves of violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana useless social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"name without name, she wrote posts on Facebook, in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he isolated it."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos itself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"other Facebook users asked Mariana, why they had fallen so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier."</seg>

<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely seen or not mentioned in the media. this is an increasing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"for the need, on-site medical research there are two reasons: for a lack of global health care, many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for research on these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"second, research, which is conducted by African scientists, in building own research capacity in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent."</seg>

<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrior RW: at the moment the focus of my work lies on the application of research results. I support the samic national program for anti-retroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">"in addition, I have just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think is the most important scientific topics in your country and in general?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">Rw: there are no basic research here. we only rely solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"this must change, otherwise we will always stay receivers instead of being both creators."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not suitable in our surroundings, and sometimes it's even impossible to use them here."</seg>

<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>

<seg id="2622">"there is need for special scientific training, starting at any age."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer sciences, big data, research of outer space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly."</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a researcher in Africa over Western countries based on your experience?</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: like "open source" seed manufacturers to change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this contribution from Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine, which reports on solutions for environmental problems all around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the USA for the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties of, such as Outrageous, the first plant, which has been grown by NASA astronauts in Space and consumed."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's labour was only set by its own ingenuity and the question of how many Salatvarieties can get limits."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"in the early 2000s, he noted that ever more salads were patented, and that he could not continue to use it anymore."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"patents are not only for individual grades, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green ton or curved leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more and more such patents have been registered on more and more plants such as cereals or cartels. based on these trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as passionate representatives of a millennia of a millennia of millennia, Morton is getting a salad, but he now needs more, since its work is still further aggravated by ever more restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It's as if there are a lump in a river to which I must turn out.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think these patents go far on salads."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and when they withstand the court, no one can breed a new Salatty, because all the features are patented. so he is doing as good as possible and tries to breed those characteristics that he wants."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and strives to use no material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined in a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world: open source braeding ("open source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Mathematics ISS have cultivated red tubes in the "greenhouse" of the station "and eaten. there is tested whether plants can be cultivated in the space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">"it is no coincidence that this name seems rather that it sounds like the movement from the IT area, and not from the area of plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for" "open source" ") can be inspired by the movement for free" open source "software, which offers alternatives to copyrighted software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was brought into life to make sure that some plant species and species are not protected as intellectual property, and thus usable for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"in the context of the initiative, briefly called Ossi, US breeders can commit to that others can freely use it freely."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and to sell it." open source "breeders only allow others to breed their seeds, to breed so their own varieties, and it will not immediately agree - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeder and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emeried professor of University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-board member, Jack Kloppenburg have control over the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and for environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to him, seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would attempt to use the latter not or only little by brewed seed with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open source" movement is not busy with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." "to buy our goal of ecological sustainability, the latest examples illustrate the merger of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer who, for example, are offered on farmers markets, should also know that the way this vegetables is bred."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"nutrition, without seeds-sovereign, is not possible."</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed initiative commit themselves to resign others their seeds as well. thus, its action is to patent in contrast to seeds, seeds and plant-characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argued that the future of food supplies is endangered because the available gene pool due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus always more restrictive."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, Executive director of the Ossi, has engaged in her PhD work with a genetic variation with carrots and their availability. it found out that about one-third of all antibody features are protected as intellectual property, making it usable or only usable for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants there are such estimates yet not, but experts like Luby suggests that massacres cultivated plants like wheat in an even bigger style are patented or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are cultivated as they have targeted characteristics - from such, through which their taste or colour improves until such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and keep threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeder by more and more patents is declining. genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since the changing conditions due to climate change are much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail Monsanto spokesperson in Carly Scaduto, that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four Genbanks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the United States, the company is set up for the preservation of genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts that intellectual property is restricting other breeders, since" patents and the protection of plant-hazardous innovations. "" a patent is basically taken a plan that everyone can follow once the patent is up. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">"often, these instructions help others to achieve the same result."</seg>
<seg id="2666">"thus, such protection inhibits innovation not, but promotes it by providing the public more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees that different: 20 years to wait until a patent is baptism, does not render it any innovation."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait such a long time to breed plants that are adapted to the changing environment conditions, one would have lost the struggle."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main argument for Morton is, however, that genetic resources are always been a general good and should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monthless incentives for us are not attractive. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to facilitate their work.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what motivates us, and it will make us impossible if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total Morton was not bothering to the concept of itself, plant features:" we do not create the characteristics really themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeder we do not have any idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol branch, plant breeding in the U.S. state Oregon and Ossi-board member, there is another important aspect of the plant breeding:" "who chastified a variety, also has its own values into it."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and monokultures, for whose cultivation it is necessary for herbicide, to grow out of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">"my concept is exactly genetically modified." ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that are moving on international markets, but smaller than B. Monsanto are) patents manage to survive the most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they oppose the patent or they stick it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeding Frank Morton is looking for in his breeding garden salads.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the view that breeder through the prevention of plant patents would be innovative:" it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than a company, the patent. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need constantly new material for my catalogue as I know that my competitors are being selling my varieties within a couple of years", "he says." with a patent for 20 years, he says. "" with a patent she is very nice to do with my opinion. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seem to be a leader in the" Open Source "breeding, but the concept is rapidly spreading throughout the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India the centre for sustainable agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the area of resources, a" open source "seed program. to preserve the seed sector, the centre is working with farmers, helping them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2685">"it also supports them to come to" Open Source "seed, and sell their own."</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organization Agrecol is working on an" Open Source "License, which is ultimately a more formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(regulations for breeding differ from country to country, present because the Ossi obligation cannot simply be one of one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"in early November 2016, the executive committee of the European Union, the European Commission, declares that conventional plants should not be patenting. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European patent-act, which allowed patents on conventionally cultivated plants."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is on the governments of the Member States to bring the patent offices to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos hosted a conference on" open source "seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives from governments, NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa to learn about the" Open Source "seed movement and the global trend towards patenting seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for" Open Source "- seed systems, that the organization currently establishes a global alliance for" open source "seed systems, for the planned next year of the official start signal."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a consortium of environmental protection and development groups (including hivos, the international nonprofit development aid organization USC Canada and the Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has put together a database on seeds and biodiversity worldwide in order to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of the food - a network of aid organizations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - it represents the possibility that farmers have the opportunity to put on seeds and improve the seed policy to ensure that a stable supply of food can be ensured."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also emphasises the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a link, from the Luby of Ossi hopes to recognize him soon more people."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has mostly taken care of where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role" so Luby. "we are now trying to make people clear that even more behind their foods are."</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the most recent goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">"still, the Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnists.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"on the weekend around May 5, the Egyptian Government draws the website of the Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights abuses in Egypt and the Arab world."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"in August the network published an opinion on Facebook, in which it criticised the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region."</seg>
<seg id="2725">"defending the Network for Human Rights Information abiding - despite this attack and the mocking of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities, who must defend the law and to give victims a voice. even though it has never been as difficult as now. ANHRI has never been so important to overcome the freedom of freedom and human rights in the Arab world. we insist that all technical possibilities must be exhausted to overcome the blocking and not imitate our task."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is considered to be the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities block the independent news page MADA Masr, Arab-language issue of Huffington Post and the Qatar network of Al Jazeera due to the" "support of terrorism". ""</seg>

<seg id="2728">"in addition to ANHRI, there is also no access to Egypt's blog on the blog of the columnists and human rights research scientist Ahmed Gamal Ziada."</seg>
<seg id="2729">"Ziada used his blog for the spread of columnists and articles, which he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media."</seg>
<seg id="2730">"now the blog, which he built to deal with the censored instrument of the Egyptian government, even the goal of an attack."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"bloggers, who is home to the Chinese blog (bloggers), on the other hand, is further accessible."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after he reported by Egyptian security forces, while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video, like the police of physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly about politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada refers to the blocking of the government and reflected, what this means to him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"the blogs to unlock is very old, however, has priority in the era of Abdelfatal thatropal-Sisi's priority; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, then it is for two reasons for me:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It has been able to give me the feeling of an affolation board; a arrested murder, a attempted murder, proach on the national Security Council, the blocking of blogs as well as any other web page, for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) You proved that I did not wrote in vain. in other words, my words have an influence, even if only on a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"first, I used it to post the post of articles to get the censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"however, after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mugs go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06. August 133 websites. this took technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider (ISP), including orange, Vodafone and Etisalat."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"AFTE also documented the blocking of vendors, which was possible through the relocation of internet access and private surfing, so called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12 we noticed how the blocking of web pages which I offer, began."</seg>
<seg id="2746">"such a practice indicates the intent of the government to block and filter contents, which might have access to the Egyptian users."</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation will additionally be aggravated that the censored decision had been made behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis, using the courts to proceed against these actions."</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants are arguing.</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the Brazilian army at a use in the favelas in Niterói, a town located in the state of Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis."</seg>

<seg id="2753">"day 1 day newspapers report throughout Brazil with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous other postcard motives."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot in school" "Jeden second day will be murdered by police officer in Rio de Janeiro," "thieves pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, marine and Air Force."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the end of 2017 reached its highest level for 10 years."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian government of Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports such as these are daily and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"published for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio well-known newspaper" "Extra" "on 16 August the editorial" "This is not normal" "in which they announced, a new section called" war in Rio "." "</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the newspaper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">"extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sex break, etc. everything, however, happened by the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be called" "war in Rio" ": this is not normal!"</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative to which we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a four-minute video that was divided on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, the editor-in-Chief of the newspaper, that this decision is not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war rubrik in a country that does not recognise the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 areas where criminal organizations are controlled."</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial the newspaper writes on:</seg>
<seg id="2768">"we are aware that a war circuit, if he is distorts, even to be used, atrocities of the police that are only shoots, and then ask questions to concede."</seg>
<seg id="2769">"but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners."</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" savoids more than they used?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist of Cecília Oliveira, on the other hand, refer to violence as a" war. "this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold responsibility in the police to account."</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"this is the result of corruption and poor planning - like extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education, and a historical and self-bogus neglect of public service."</seg>

<seg id="2781">"these security measures also belonged to the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), one of the Federal State of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to conquer a massive police system through the use of a massive police officer and a unit permanent there."</seg>
<seg id="2782">"in the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of bloody death cases. however, for several years, the UPP began to protect more about Ships and repression against the poor communities who actually protect the newly created police unit."</seg>

<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape Aperaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">He worked in a coal mine for a few years. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">"then he took what was left from his low wages, and went to Iran. once again he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and towing sacks with mortar, which were heavier than he himself, to make himself a living."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"at that time, as today, life afghan refugees was shaped by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," I remembered Acartoaf in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the site, where we also worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">"there were no services and no heating there. we hanged nylon in front of the open windows, so that we were not freezing at night."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Aperaf left his life without Papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"on the dangerous crossing of the sea, he suffered boat departure and strangled on a small, uninhabited Greek island."</seg>
