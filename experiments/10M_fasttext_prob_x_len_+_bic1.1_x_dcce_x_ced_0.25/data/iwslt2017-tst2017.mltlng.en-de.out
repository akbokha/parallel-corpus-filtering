this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New @-@ York re@@ porter .
&quot; long before someone heard about Edward Snow@@ den , wrote a book in which he was spectacular , that the NSA had listened to illeg@@ ally from Americans . &quot;
&quot; it is another chapter , which should leave a lasting impression . &quot;
&quot; in this , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence co @-@ operation where the CIA was literally dra@@ ined by Iran for an atomic bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible history .
&quot; but , do you know who the chapter was not covered ? &quot;
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years the government had determined against r@@ isen and called on it to name its alleged sources .
&quot; in this train , he became a symbol for the design of the government , wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to condemn and journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to First Constitutional Treaty , the media have the right to release secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to use this right , if media cannot get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the mud that they should do . &quot;
&quot; so when the government sought after R@@ isen , he did something that many brave re@@ porters did before him , he refused , and said he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , ration@@ ing lived with the risk of going to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the process , something exceptional . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , though she had been indications for years that it would be vital for their case , the demands of the government in R@@ isen were dropped . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the re@@ porter and springs can hide less and less .
&quot; rather than trying to fail and bring up R@@ isen for statements , this might also do its digital foot@@ prints for it . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators have secretly , without his consent , his telephone calls for secret , &quot;
&quot; just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its credit ratings , and even travel notes with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wer and ris@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised at his victory , to protect wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers . but instead , the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government has too much of their work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work in the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional report , because the government has more possibilities to pi@@ erce all of them . &quot;
&quot; but just as the technology of the government allowed the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; and indeed , they can turn it from the moment in which they engage in contact , rather than in retrosp@@ ect , in witness . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software , which there has not yet been when R@@ isen had written his book , and it is much safer than regular e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source control system for wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , which was originally developed from the internet famous , which has been developed by us received Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now been developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news @-@ site , like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , just like every ordinary contact form . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
&quot; so , the government can no longer obtain information secretly , and many of the information they would request would not be available from the start . &quot;
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ y technology that end@@ anger us all . &quot;
&quot; it is to ensure that not only technology specialist , such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to bring Mis@@ set@@ ters . it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , &quot;
&quot; who knows about mis@@ hes in the supply of soldiers and wants to report from crowded hospitals , or the next environmental worker , the alarm to the contaminated water of f@@ lin@@ t . or a wall @-@ in@@ sider that warns us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thanks .
&quot; &#91; on 3 April 2016 , the biggest data le@@ ck of the story was released . &#93; &#91; the &quot; &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; &quot; contained that friction and moderation &#93; have hidden in tax hav@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ate Robert Pal@@ mer from Global W@@ acker by a statement . &#93; This week we were based on messages about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the &quot; &quot; lawyers &quot; &quot; Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca . &quot;
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers are going to firms like Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca and say , &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works , as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bashar al @-@ Assad stamp @-@ firms in tax hav@@ ens has .
&quot; it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of children &apos;s days , one of the famous cell@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people out there , and others are waiting to wait for the next release , and the next revealed documents . &quot;
now it sounds like the plot of an agency &apos;s tent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
&quot; it seems crying away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we address this ?
&quot; but the truth is , if the rich and powerful ones are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and do not pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and this concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , global wool , these revelations have been phenomenal . &quot;
&quot; throughout the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax hav@@ ens are used by a few of them to hide and conce@@ al their assets - something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think so many people this whole world appears very confusing , and it is hard to understand how these tax hav@@ ens function . &quot;
I always put it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ che .
&quot; so one has a company in another company , in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters is . &quot;
I find it interesting that in the US there are fewer reports on this matter .
&quot; presumably , because there were no prominent Americans in these revelations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not that there are no wealthy Americans who hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; but by the principle of which these tax hav@@ ens function , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American clients . &quot;
&quot; if we would have a data le@@ ak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that in some US @-@ states you need less information to give less information to create a company than to obtain a libr@@ arian . &quot;
this kind of in@@ transpar@@ ence in the US has allowed employees of deb@@ ou@@ les to pick up school children .
che@@ ers has allowed che@@ ers to pick especially suscep@@ tible investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global W@@ OL we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it actually work ?
&quot; so we sent a secret investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 Law@@ yers in Manhattan , Germany . &quot;
&quot; our investig@@ ator gave himself an African Minister , who wanted to bring the susp@@ ects money to the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; it really shocked us that all have made up suggestions for an attorney to our investig@@ ator , how he could transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; these were all pre@@ tense . none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was handed over to money . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as a case .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our co@@ vert investigation .
&quot; it is not about a single class of leaders , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , established by the corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we must change the rules . &quot;
we must change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
&quot; it may sound everything very dull , as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing ever had changed ; as if there is always the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as secure optim@@ ist , I fully see that a lot of things started to change . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years we have seen impulses towards more transparency , as regards the owners of companies . &quot;
the subject took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU is captured in central reg@@ isters at the national level who really lies behind companies in Europe and who controls it . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a bill &apos;s draft in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means to ensure more transparency in the U.S. and globally . &quot;
for us at Global W@@ ana this is a moment for change .
&quot; we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ boards . &quot;
we need managers in the economy to get up and say : &quot; In@@ transpar@@ ence is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it , through laws to end this kind of in@@ transpar@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; together we can finally finish the In@@ transpar@@ ence , which now allows this kind of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ undering . &quot;
that is the story of how I had almost ab@@ duc@@ ted almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and the trunk of a red ma@@ z@@ ema .
&quot; one day after I finished my design study , I made a back@@ yard sale . &quot;
a guy stayed in the red ma@@ z@@ da and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
&quot; he was alone in the city , and just made a road trip across the country . afterwards , he would go to the peace cor@@ ps . &quot;
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; where do you sleep today ? &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing worse , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I need to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know it ! he said that he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land the trunk of a ma@@ z@@ ap ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard myself : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; h , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling , and thought , &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what I have broken down to me ? &quot;
a wild es@@ tran@@ ft in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such fear that I rose out of bed , moved to toe at ti@@ p@@ toes , and my sleeping door closed . &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in touch .
&quot; the artwork , which he had bought from me is today in his classroom . he is now a teacher . &quot;
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my perspective .
&quot; maybe the people who were sold to me in childhood as foreigners , actually friends , who only waited to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; to accommodate people on my air mattress , it was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; we take a time @-@ jump , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my room@@ mate attracts and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I think , creativity can create it , fear in fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I got over how we could earn something about it . our apartment will stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including , including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep at the air mattress at wooden floors for 20 dollars .
&quot; they found it super , and we too . &quot;
&quot; I am sure our cheese @-@ ham O@@ mel@@ et tasted completely different , because we made them for our guests . &quot;
&quot; we tou@@ red with them all the city . when we passed our last guest , and the door to the castle fell , rigid Brian and I sat down . &quot;
we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent ?
things came into roles .
&quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as developers . &quot;
we wanted to find out if one could make a business concept .
&quot; we presented our Invest@@ ors : &quot; we want to create a site on which people post on publicly images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot;
&quot; over the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them . &quot;
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the rocket would ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
&quot; no one who is still at comfort , would invest in a business , allowed strangers to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we as children have all learned that foreigners are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , one bes@@ ses on the things that you can do . we could be designed . &quot;
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
&quot; we had learned how to design@@ ate objects , but now we wanted to create trust through design immense trust , between people who had never met before . &quot;
design can design such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design confidence ?
I would like to give you a precious sample the degree you trust we have .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
&quot; now , I would like to unlock your cell phone . &quot;
type your ent@@ ail mobile phone to your left sitting .
&quot; this quietly flight flight from panic , which you are now feeling -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the door the first time . &quot;
&quot; because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile , is your home . &quot;
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to keep the bul@@ ky phone of a stranger in the hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
&quot; so , most guests feel when they stay elsewhere . &quot;
only for this reason can our company exist .
&quot; only then , who now has Al Gor@@ es mobile ? &quot;
could you pro@@ claim on Twitter that he gives president to the President &apos;s Office ?
you can return the mobile phones now .
you now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we have changed a little detail of this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbour had first presented with his name ; when he tells , where he comes , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
&quot; imagine you would have 150 ratings , which all say , &quot; &quot; he really can hold very well @-@ red mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to leave your cell phone ?
because a well @-@ thought feedback system rein@@ forces the confidence .
at the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for the people to give negative assessments .
&quot; ultimately , we decided to wait until both Ho@@ sts and Guest had given their votes before we asked them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are regarding age and housing . &quot;
a little surprisingly we trust the people most who are most similar to us .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
&quot; in our case , it is exciting when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case through assessments . &quot;
&quot; if one has less than three acts , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but one has more than ten , changes everything . &quot;
a good reputation is common in common .
so the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted likes .
&quot; moreover , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you can expect from there . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell a bit like &quot; &quot; hi ! &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; one tells you too much , such as : &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request will be rather not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal level of openness , for example &apos; wool art@@ works in your apartment ! I make holiday with my family vacation . &quot;
how can I create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
&quot; we use the size of the text box to recommend the correct amount of text , and we also give tips on which subjects you should write . &quot;
our entire company is based on hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against foreigners .
&quot; with what we had not reck@@ oned , the large amount of people who were more than willing to lay these prejudices . &quot;
here you see how many people take our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , incredibly good luck . &quot;
&quot; second , the tirel@@ ess work of our team . &quot;
&quot; third , a need which was not covered before . &quot;
the business is running very well for us .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have un@@ allowed parties ha@@ vo@@ iced or dwell@@ ed .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
&quot; I stood at the front front , if trust was broken . &quot;
there is nothing scar@@ lim@@ mer@@ es than these calls . it already hur@@ ts when I only think of it .
&quot; the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the An@@ ru@@ fer , was and will always be our greatest motivation to improve ourselves . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the 123 million paid nights had only a fraction of the problem . &quot;
for people are familiar to one another .
&quot; if trust works , we can arise out . &quot;
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host was driving him to the hospital .
it even split blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travellers , who tend to be dy@@ nasty because of sitting activities . &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals .
&quot; Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real preser@@ ves , which save one life , even though they don &apos;t know at all . &quot;
&quot; you will drive one in your own car into the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they do not want you feel lonely , they bring books over . &quot;
you can even leave a longer stay without charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so of course not every stay will run away .
but these relationships behind pure money trans@@ action are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled about this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with cash flow ?
it is here about an economic trade .
&quot; but it is now just a &quot; &quot; car industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot;
&quot; Share Economy describes a trade , which promises human relationships . &quot;
people place a part of themselves open and that changes everything .
&quot; when one travels nowadays , it is compared with Fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but it is less authentic . &quot;
but what would be if traveling a rich buffet of local impressions would be ?
&quot; what would be if at any location one visits a group there , Ans@@ äs@@ si@@ ger would wait to fill a thoroughly and one at a pub @-@ pent@@ ine district , one of which has never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could enjoy cooking of a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; today , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would like to design apartments from the ground up to together ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would take the idea of a shared share ?
&quot; I imagine cities that enable us to serve society and relationships , instead of lon@@ eliness and de@@ preci@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces , which belonged to the government , &quot;
&quot; were offered by the residents . students , who were looking for a lead , &quot;
were launched to people whose children were raised up . they were started In@@ cub@@ ator programs .
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . through our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest at a stranger or even host . &quot;
the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was introduced to us .
we have not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality also existed before .
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why did our work ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudices .
&quot; I think that is amazing , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
every time I have to think about when a red ma@@ z@@ da goes over to me .
we know of course that design can not solve any problem .
&quot; but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder why we can use design soon . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a faithful ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; re@@ pressed , subjected to brain @-@ washing , a terrorist list ? &quot;
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you the fault for your negative impressions .
the media represents people who look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans mean most would not know Muslims .
probably people do not speak to their u@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for those who have never met Muslims , it is great to meet you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ;
a g@@ love @-@ like @-@ fitness fan @-@ fan@@ ati@@ sts , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I was not born so . &quot;
I have chosen this .
when I was 17 years old I decided to ou@@ w my decision .
&quot; no , not as homo@@ sexual human beings , as some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head@@ gear . &quot;
&quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied , &quot; why oppressed you yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the som@@ ber was : at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence , and in comparison to the pressure which I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt me to a perfect and un@@ reachable beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have with the Quran .
&quot; I read it , thought , according to him , imagined , and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Quran .
the beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to tears .
I see myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone you perc@@ ei@@ ves you fully understands and yet somehow loves ?
this is how it feels .
&quot; I married and began , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; I later had , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian American Dream &quot; dream . &quot;
then came that horrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I was sitting in my kitchen , had an early breakfast , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; E@@ il@@ lover . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , planes flo@@ wn in buildings , people sp@@ itting from the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock quickly turned into rebellion .
why should one do something like that ?
&quot; I switched on the television channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it has not only been attacked my country , but in the N@@ u transformed me the actions of others from a civil war into a susp@@ ects . &quot;
the same day we had to drive through the US West to move into a new city and begin studying .
&quot; I remember , as I went dig@@ ging -- so deep it went up into my seat , and I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we went to our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then heard , I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said , &quot; &quot; be watch@@ ful &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; be vigil@@ ant , &quot; &quot; lead in well @-@ lighted areas , &quot; &quot; se@@ ed@@ ling you not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
&quot; then there was Friday in that week -- the day , in which Muslims gather for prayer . &quot;
&quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a destination . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage of this .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably fil@@ tered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or the people that one held for Muslims , war@@ med free and struck . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked the country had attacked our land .
I have rep@@ elled the fur@@ y of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain themselves constantly .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
the accus@@ ations are tough .
nowadays we can actually say people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to join Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
it only poses the question : are we mal@@ ignant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ignant tumor can be removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor just under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is false .
&quot; Muslims are like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but a vital organ . &quot;
thanks !
Muslims are inventor and teacher of first @-@ gather@@ ers and Olympi@@ oni@@ ds .
will the closure of mos@@ ques America be safer ?
&quot; it might be released a few parking spaces , but not stop terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mosque leads to the people of other fai@@ ths , tolerant persons , and to show greater citizenship . &quot;
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington , DC recently told , people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; when the radic@@ alization process has been found that he begins online . as a First , the person is cut off from her church , so that the person believes that the person feels the true Muslims , and anyone who desp@@ ises their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor , or faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we need to stop the people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Quran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would add to their imagination , when one ackno@@ wle@@ dges it as representatives of 1.6 billion believers . &quot;
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but if one thro@@ ws a look at it , it is not driving them what they read in their &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the scriptures .
an outstanding Ima@@ m told me recently an amazing story :
&quot; a girl came to him , because she had imagined to join the IS . &quot;
I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was exactly the opposite . any cl@@ ergy with whom she had spoken , she brought her to the silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense to their anger , it was a main objective for the instrument@@ alisation by extremis@@ ts who promised a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m turned the connection to God and her church again .
instead of acc@@ using it for their anger he showed her constructive way for a real change in the world .
&quot; what she learned in the mosque , kept it before joining the IS . &quot;
it was an insight into how the Islam@@ ophobia lead me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
&quot; how affects the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day on our democracy , to our freedom of thought ? &quot;
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , happen at least three things . &quot;
we are rather an author@@ itarian government system con@@ formance and prejudices .
&quot; a study reveals : if you examine reviews , in which negative about Muslims was reported , they signi@@ fy rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look when the mood for Muslims led to the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the advance of the Iraq war and during the two periods of the election .
&quot; so , Islam@@ ophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Moz@@ lem @-@ terrorist , as I expected it . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool to manipulation the public to spread the foundations of a free society , the rational and well informed citizens . &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning .
&quot; we may sense it as the first , but the toxic air of fear keeps us all . &quot;
in the assignment of collec@@ tiv@@ ism it is not just about to explain themselves to oneself .
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple that lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was an athle@@ te .
&quot; he was on the dental faculty , talented , much promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me , that he was the sweet@@ est , generous man , whom she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when is from my br@@ otherhood , such a sealed young man became ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne in her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Craig Stephen Hi@@ cks , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an that was in the afternoon when he posted statements against Muslims on his fac@@ ebook page . &quot;
he has eight times at De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
have we gone to the mosque or were we safe at home ?
&quot; we boar@@ ded it , and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about how America we left to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely . &quot;
we decided to go to the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we headed silent , with high pressure on the mosque . &quot;
&quot; and I took him out , my shoes went out , went into prayer , and what I saw , caused me to stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then , the Ima@@ m made an announcement , than@@ ked her and was called our guests , for half of the gathered Christians were Christians , Jews , Buddh@@ ists , A@@ the@@ ists , believers and non @-@ believers who had come to attack us , but to join us . &quot;
at this moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and sympathy of panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you go on number sure ?
or will you join those who mean : we are better than that .
many thanks .
thanks beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have made a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what do you say to those who perhaps claim that you are a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker working with dr@@ au@@ ght , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ hi@@ ed : I would say you are not fool@@ ed . I am completely normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not uncommon .
I am as usual as it is permitted .
&quot; looking at Muslims around the world , and I did this with the most done study to Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
&quot; so , I am not an exception . &quot;
&quot; if people seem like an exception to a rule , then usually the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ hi@@ ed .
&quot; what began as a platform for cra@@ fting , is about to become a billi@@ on@@ aire . &quot;
&quot; monitoring , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journalism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . it is made possible in research institutions around the world . &quot;
&quot; before air parcel registration into our social consciousness , a autonomous fleet of aircraft machines at the Fra@@ c Centre in France are built in front of the audience a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . a few years ago , they began to fly with arrows . &quot;
&quot; through inter@@ locking , air devices reach high speed and speed in narro@@ west room . &quot;
you can also build up @-@ to @-@ date load@@ able structures .
they have learned to bear the burden to deal with turmoil and generally respond to natural laws .
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the limits of Pos@@ sible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; thus , a system of autonomous functions , it must know collectively , where in the room the mobile objects are located . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at the ET@@ H Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynam@@ ical tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a company of our laboratories . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each air @-@ machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , Calcul@@ ations on board , which should do the machine . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available at the highest level . e.g. , &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter .
&quot; a air@@ field , which tries to beat two flies with a cap . &quot;
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in advance flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most of the starter forces , it can float , and thus has great advantages in start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a downside . &quot;
a limitation of H@@ eck@@ ers is that they react to turbul@@ ence like wind arches .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
&quot; the idea behind it is that the aircraft , no matter what position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing . &quot;
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often ask ourselves basic abstract issues that penetrate to the core of the matter . &quot;
such a question would be for example : what is the smaller number of mo@@ ve@@ able parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicopter are approximately known as machines with a thousand moving parts that gather together to hurt you .
&quot; decades ago , trained pilot @-@ controlled air devices could fly , which only had two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a tail@@ oring . &quot;
&quot; recently , we discovered that flying with only one works . &quot;
this is the mon@@ bu@@ inner that is the mechan@@ ically simplest air device . it was invented recently .
&quot; it has only a moving part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no valves , hing@@ es and cross @-@ section , no further actu@@ ation or control surfaces , only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , in interior live very much , so that it can fly st@@ ably and move in space . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tail@@ gate . to get it to flying , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the likelihood to throw it right when all of me watch is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; when the moon is a practice in simplicity , this machine is here , the omni@@ head @-@ ter with its eight pro@@ vers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this passage ?
they see that he is only symm@@ et@@ rical .
&quot; therefore , he is ambi@@ valent in his direction . &quot;
&quot; thus , he receives the proper ability , &quot;
&quot; move in the room in all directions , no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even as it rotating . &quot;
&quot; of course , he is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight pro@@ vers . &quot;
&quot; some is able in models , the rest will be learned directly from flying . &quot;
let &apos;s see that .
&quot; when flying parts are to be part of our daily life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine is composed of two separate two @-@ prop@@ ellers .
this rot@@ ates in the clo@@ ck@@ wise direction
and the other against clo@@ ck@@ wise .
&quot; if one builds it together , they act like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , a little bit wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronic or a battery , the machine can continue to fly , if restricted . &quot;
we will demonstrate that by doing half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration examines synthetic s@@ warming .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , co @-@ ordin@@ ated units enables a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took retail micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than one disc bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no limit .
hopefully you will motivate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine as dr@@ ens want to be on Broadway to become a fl@@ atten@@ dant par@@ ach@@ ute .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to pre@@ dict the influence of this technology . &quot;
for types like us the wage is in development and creation .
&quot; it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it is creative , clever creatures are allowed to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
&quot; 1,3 billion years ago transformed into a very distant galax@@ ies 2 black holes each other more quickly , they turned the mass tri@@ but@@ ts in a tenth and pure energy in pure energy . &quot;
this short moments they were bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but her energy kept it not in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was given into the space @-@ time fabric itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
&quot; initially , we first arrange the events temporarily . &quot;
a period of 1.3 billion years ago has just emerged .
&quot; since then the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ os@@ aur@@ s , humans and -- God stand with us -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group decided especially mu@@ le -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech - to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which arise approximately through col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them held them crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea .
&quot; after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely much hard work , they built the Det@@ ector LIG@@ O : the laser @-@ interfer@@ ometer for the laser . &quot;
&quot; in the following time , the precision of LIG@@ O could greatly increase , resulting in improved performance . &quot;
that &apos;s why you call it Advanced LIG@@ O .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , LIG@@ O was launched for a last test run to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes are through the earth . &quot;
you went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional as this :
the birth of my daughter
and the departure from my To@@ d@@ ill father .
&quot; basically , they were the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; all that , for which I had worked , is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theore@@ tic physic@@ ist at MIT . he studied gra@@ vit@@ ational signals from black holes and their by observ@@ atories as LIG@@ O measurable signals . but what are the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cl@@ usal in the fabric of space and time .
&quot; when passing the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched towards a direction and into the other hand . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the illustration , lec@@ tur@@ ers in courses for the Rel@@ ativity Theory are often a true al@@ ber@@ ty dance . &quot;
&quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridiculous . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September , for example , each of us was stretched by the waves of the waves and stri@@ pped . the stretching of an average person was 10 high @-@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that is said 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a first Dar@@ um , one declared the LIG@@ O staff for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometers long laser @-@ det@@ ector , and that is absurd , this length would have to be exactly measured on less than a thou@@ sand@@ th of a atom radius . that is grot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classical text on grav@@ itation
&quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder LIG@@ O , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are tremendous . &quot;
&quot; however , physic@@ ists are glo@@ om@@ ically and with the support of the public , certainly all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this success in 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
&quot; back to LIG@@ O . Scott maintains , LIG@@ O may be more like an eye than an eye . &quot;
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength that is much smaller than the things around us : facial extracts , the size of your mobile phones . &quot;
this is quite handy . for this way you can make a picture or a map of things by watching the light around you from several points .
with pot@@ holes this is different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; that &apos;s why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean you especially much : &quot;
the face of your child .
&quot; instead we listen to certain characteristics such as ton@@ ing and height , rhythm and volume , to close the history behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , Alice speaks Alice . &quot;
and Bob breaks her .
&quot; s@@ wimm@@ ers Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
with them we cannot produce simple pictures of objects in all .
&quot; but by respecting changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for LIG@@ O the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble area .
&quot; so if we convert wave pattern in all , we can literally speak all literally . &quot;
&quot; to listen to the gravity , it can tell us about a collision of two black holes , with what my colleague Scott has been working for a long time . &quot;
&quot; S@@ H : two black , not revol@@ ving holes , round @-@ off : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
turning on the two bodies very quickly you hear the same circle with an additional sound change . this sounds so on : Wu @-@ Wu @-@ Wu @-@ Wu @-@ Wu !
&quot; it is a kind of movement , engra@@ ved in the wav@@ e@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date , that at least I will never forget -- hearing LIG@@ O follo@@ wer : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ al noise &#93; , who knows what he has to hear , can see this as a sound of -- S@@ H : ... two black holes with the 30 @-@ f@@ acher solar mass , which revol@@ ve around as fast as the sticks of your mix@@ er . &quot;
AA : do we consider ourselves briefly what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dense body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve each hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we have heard it .
therein lies the permanent significance of LIG@@ O .
&quot; LIG@@ O p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the Al@@ ls , as never was possible before . &quot;
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much at All we can -- virtually or basically -- not visible .
&quot; a super @-@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why mask stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; the exciting physical processes occur but at the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers from iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never see through this op@@ ak .
&quot; the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron , as if it would be transparent glass . the Ur@@ b@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it as the Ur@@ b@@ ang is covered through his own neighbour . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; the most important thing : I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen before , and of which we have no idea of . things that we only discover , by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , LIG@@ O found equal in the first attempt things we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the LIG@@ O project , says to this issue : Me : the kind of stars , the black holes emerge , like LIG@@ O they observe , are the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s of the Universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , age @-@ old bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are the sau@@ er@@ bones for our arche@@ ological work . &quot;
&quot; LIG@@ O gives us a completely different point of view on what is happening in all , on the origin of the stars and ultimately to how we came out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now exists to be as bold as possible .
&quot; thanks to LIG@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the universe . &quot;
we need ideas for new observatory - a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than the Ur@@ b@@ ang itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
a while ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; for a year I would say to everything &quot; &quot; Yes , &quot; &quot; before I feared . &quot;
&quot; whether it made me nervous , in unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; &quot; yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be on TV live ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
wanted to start with the swing ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do , I feared , washed my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear to keep talking , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , gone . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , has changed my life . &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me . &quot;
but there was a certain Yes that deeply changed my life on an unexpected article . it started with a question of my youngest .
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for un@@ avo@@ wed reasons all &quot; estim@@ ations , &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the South .
&quot; estimates , I need milk for my beak @-@ dog breed . &quot;
she once asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the go . and I said : &quot; yes .
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; a new attitude to my family . from then I swe@@ ar to myself , always play with them as soon as you ask me for it . no matter what I just do , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I am not perfect , but I am trying so much . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family . &quot;
but it also has a da@@ unting side @-@ effect : first I understood actually completely that the &quot; Yes &quot; sa@@ ws to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think of things out of life and look back to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I Cre@@ am TV . I produced television .
&quot; I make television , in great style . &quot;
in this TV @-@ season I &apos;m responsible for being able to carry out 70 hours of the program into the world .
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
every shipment offers hundreds of jobs that previously didn &apos;t exist .
the budget for an episode of a television sen@@ ders can lie between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
&quot; a new episode all nine days in four shows , i.e. all nine days 20 million TV , four television programs , four hours TV , three shows : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 hours television , &quot;
350 million dollars for one season .
in America my television series are running on Thurs@@ days .
&quot; all over the world , my series will run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I myself created , and not only produced , so still prevailing . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four television series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fire , which burn around the world . &quot;
do you know who that is still doing ?
&quot; nobody , that is why I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I tell you so all of you who work so hard , whether you &apos;re a company , a country or a home classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously if I say , I understand that I don &apos;t just get around on the computer and fanta@@ si@@ ere , and it is true when I say , I understand that it &apos;s not dre@@ aming in a dre@@ ary job . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work much , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am absorbed into the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
&quot; it is , when turned troops up , then I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; for example , one sees a high tone , lying a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechan@@ ically , ti@@ ring and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and troubled , clin@@ ically and maternal , cruel and sensible . and the best thing is that is the buzz . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
&quot; a buzz begins in my head , and it grows and growing , and the buzz h@@ ears as a bustling street , I could go on her forever . &quot;
&quot; many people assume that when I declare to them the buzz , that I talked to writing that writing should give me a pleasure . &quot;
don &apos;t understand me wrong that does it .
&quot; but the buzz -- when I began to work with television production , when I began to work and work , build and work together , I discovered this matter , this amount , this energy . &quot;
the buzz is more than writing .
the sums are action and activity . the sums of money is a drug .
the buzz is music . the buzz is light and air .
the buzz of God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a buzz , then you cannot strive for any different size . &quot;
&quot; feeling , not to be different than to seek size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the buzz .
or maybe it also means a work@@ a@@ holic .
maybe it is called genius .
maybe it is the ego .
maybe it is the fear of failure .
I do not know .
&quot; I know only that I am not made for failure , and I just know that I love the buzz . &quot;
&quot; I will only say to you , I am a Titan , and I know I will not ask it . &quot;
&quot; to make it clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more abo@@ unds , the more work there are , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more expectations there is . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , do not come true ? &quot;
&quot; the land , which I survived , the marathon , I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz . &quot;
I like that sums . I love the buzz .
I need the buzz . I am the buzz .
am I only that buzz ?
and then the buzz stopped .
&quot; over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned . &quot;
the buzz stopped .
&quot; now , my three daughters are used to the truth that her mother is a single worker . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my mother will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; estim@@ ation , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot;
there are the children of an Tit@@ ans .
you are a baby @-@ tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the tot@@ als stopped . &quot;
the buzz of the engine was mu@@ te .
I didn &apos;t love my job anymore . the engine was off .
the sums did not come back .
my buzz was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as usual : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , mess@@ ed weekends , no re@@ mor@@ ant , no re@@ viewer , a Titan sleeps , does not exist , with all heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no buzz .
in me was silence .
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a pre @-@ show @-@ Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the buzz and the sums I was .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; ha@@ y you out , bl@@ aming the author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you are doing what you are doing is to be a banker to be a servant , a mother who knows , and knows how the buzz stops , when the buzz stops , who is it then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart list@@ ens , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states &quot; wa@@ it@@ ress . &quot;
&quot; I am on the way out , late , and she says , &quot; Mama , you &apos;re playing ? &quot;
and I want to tell no things when two things are aware of :
&quot; first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she called me not . &quot;
it is no longer called an assessment . &quot;
when is that happening ?
&quot; I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and my sums were sad , and here everything is changing in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; Mama , you are playing ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this is nothing special .
&quot; we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &apos; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &apos; . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in the lon@@ eliness and the absence of the Sum@@ mon , can I do nothing but to match . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the land , which I survived , the marathon , I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , vigil@@ ant and the song in which it &apos;s going to release , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen &quot; release . &quot;
everywhere peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
play is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me is solving .
a mental door is going on and an energy sho@@ ub comes in .
&quot; and that is not immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sums are slowly coming back .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
not the buzz , but a buzz . &quot;
and now I feel like I would know a magic secret .
but let us remain with the cause .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the buzz , the work@@ men , the titanium dioxide , this is just the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself using broad@@ casts and TV lessons , and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real buzz . &quot;
the sums of money is not a force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it is dependent on the joy .
the real sums depend on love .
the sums of money is the stream that comes from the joy of life .
the real sums is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real sums ignored the pressure of the story , the performing tasks , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real buzz is simple and original .
&quot; the real buzz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps whis@@ pered God the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is simply love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
once my child wants to play with me I will say yes .
I am doing this as a firm rule so that I can rid myself as a work@@ a@@ holic of any fault .
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice , unless I want to hear the buzz . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I am not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
play does not play to me as well as working .
the truth does hurt
but I don &apos;t like it to play .
&quot; I always work , because I love it . &quot;
I prefer at work than at home .
&quot; this conc@@ ession is painful , because what a person would rather work than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well yes , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of that .
&quot; we ras@@ en in the garden , before and back , away and forth . &quot;
&quot; we are making small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play Ball .
we dis@@ fl@@ acci@@ d soap @-@ bub@@ bles .
&quot; at the same time , I feel mainly sti@@ ff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always use my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sums of the universe meet me . &quot;
&quot; I play and play , until I ask myself : why have we ever ceased with the Games ? &quot;
you can also ! tell them always yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you hold me for na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day @-@ dre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; you are probably right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you also know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting when you think .
it is just 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they get up to them that they want something different . &quot;
&quot; there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes I will replace a Mari@@ enk@@ ins or K@@ eks .
&quot; and says my teen@@ y @-@ daughter all 15 minutes with me , I am mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more needs it not . &quot;
&quot; each can bring 15 minutes a bit , even on a bad mood ! &quot;
15 minutes a bit !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distr@@ action . &quot;
the day is short : d@@ iner to get the kids ready .
but 15 minutes are possible !
&quot; my children are my wellness , my world . you do not have to be the children . it is good to feel the buzz , to have a place for his soul peace . &quot;
it is not about playing with their own children . it is about joy
about &quot; play &quot; in general .
get yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what is good for you .
find it out and keep it out .
&quot; I am not perfect in it . I sh@@ aded and I si@@ ege . friends meet , reading books to enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; want to play ? &quot; &quot; just for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show , when I got a Titan in education , when I wanted to out@@ perform myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes on the piece why don &apos;t get full 15 minutes ?
what can it be wrong ? nothing !
the sums come back in my free time . the sums seem to return if I do not work .
working does not work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an un@@ familiar melody , it fulfil@@ s me and my soul . it temp@@ ts me to new ideas . I use it to the ful@@ lest and love my work again . &quot;
&quot; I like the buzz , but I do not love it . &quot;
I do not need it .
I am not the buzz of the sums you don &apos;t know ... no more .
soap @-@ bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my sums .
the buzz of life .
the buzz of love .
&quot; the sums of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful . &quot;
&quot; it is me that I have a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said yes to less work and to play more .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire are still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the more happier I and my children . &quot;
the more I play the more I feel as a good mother .
&quot; the more I play , the more clearly my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the buzz . the country that I drive , the marathon , I run , the amount , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz , the sums of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sums , the more this unusual , preserved , naked and new feeling of life in me wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel like this , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am author . I think of things , I awake you to life . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; I said &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; to get less work and to play more . &quot;
there were no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thanks beautiful .
I am neuro@@ surgery .
&quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies . &quot;
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a serious stroke or an automobile accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ surgeon , it is very frustrating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe violation of the central nervous system , patients often have a sustained , severe disability . &quot;
that is probably the reason why I have functional neuro@@ surgery .
what is a Func@@ tional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions .
&quot; sure , they have heard of one of the most prominent , the &quot; &quot; low @-@ stag stimulation . &quot; in doing so , one can influence a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the shifting circles of neur@@ ons so that the neurological function improves . &quot;
it truly is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Par@@ kinson who suffered under heavy te@@ ats and heavy pain .
&quot; Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was leading Ober@@ doctor and worked night and night in the emergency .
often I used patients with skull @-@ Hir@@ n trau@@ ma .
they must imagine that at skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ n @-@ trau@@ mas the brain tends to increase and the skull shift increases .
&quot; to save life , one has to dimin@@ ish the skull @-@ pressure . &quot;
therefore you sometimes have to remove a part of your brain &apos;s brain .
&quot; instead of throwing away brain mass , we decided to analyze with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; to let cells from a tissue game grow , comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; it is necessary to find the proper diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to flour@@ ish . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it managed Jean @-@ François .
he saw this under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , that are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
perhaps you know from the Bi@@ ologi@@ e@@ Learning that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells which can turn into any cell type of organism .
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells have beha@@ ved differently .
&quot; they slowly shared themselves and after a couple of weeks , they even died . &quot;
&quot; so we saw a new , wei@@ rd cell @-@ population , which looked like stem cells , but kept different . &quot;
&quot; we needed long to understand , where they came . &quot;
these are from these cells .
these blue and red cells hot Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our big @-@ stag @-@ rin@@ ses .
you play a very important role in our development .
&quot; in the stage of the fet@@ us , they ensure the bra@@ ins of the brain . &quot;
but why stay they preserved us ?
we do not know that .
&quot; we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain , as we find it close to brain injury to higher concentrations . &quot;
this is not so secure .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
&quot; we are facing a potential cell source , which allows brain healing . &quot;
this is what we had to prove .
&quot; so , we decided to develop an experiment . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non @-@ language area , and then cultivate the cells in the same way as Jean @-@ François did . &quot;
and they subsequently mark colour to be able to follow them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we pl@@ ung@@ ed it to the app@@ end@@ ental of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ ologist transp@@ l@@ ant -- Aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we cut these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we cut the same cells into ra@@ zed brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with ape . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario , we cut cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely disappeared as if they were taken back home . the room is already occupied , they will not disappear , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we added a violation of and cut down the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been cut down .
&quot; evidence that they show are these small points . these are the cells which we danced in vit@@ ro , in the culture . &quot;
here we could not stop .
&quot; help these cells also have a monkey , to recover from a brain lesi@@ on ? &quot;
&quot; thus , we prepared monkeys with a manual skill purpose . &quot;
you had to take feed pel@@ lets from a tra@@ y .
they made them very good .
&quot; when they had achieved a stable skill level , we injured in the mot@@ ic cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen to people , they spontaneously sit down to some degree , just as after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of sculp@@ tural mechanisms . it will be a certain degree , just like the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left side they see the monkey , who recovered spontaneously . &quot;
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , see when we cut cells cut down : the same ap@@ ing , two months after the plantation . &quot;
I can tell you that was also for us very exciting results .
since that time we have found out a lot more about these cells .
we can free@@ ze it and use it later .
&quot; we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example with Par@@ kinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream still is to im@@ planted them with people .
&quot; I really hope that I can show you soon , how the human brain gives the means to heal yourself . &quot;
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , which is wonderful , I am sure that right now , several dozen people in the crowd , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question of what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at human beings . &quot;
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies .
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look to the future -- you have completed research and trying to get the permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone gets into the hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : this is hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will allow us the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it needs a long time to select the patients to perform and evaluate the treatments , whether it is useful to make this sort of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , you have to apply this to a multi @-@ centric study . &quot;
you must first prove that it &apos;s useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : natural . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to look at them as natural .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality , but as inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as imm@@ utable truths .
we believe that capitalism leads inevitably to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have dou@@ bt@@ lessly proved that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while the policy remains entirely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy over@@ comes with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- not likely to influence the austerity programmes in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my up@@ bringing friends , which would repe@@ ats to me that democracy would change . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to present you an economic model for genuine democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you to believe in common with me , again to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save democracy , but that we may need a true and defen@@ cel@@ tic democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy our societies are avoided , our future glo@@ omy , and our great , new technologies wasted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to refer you to an interesting contradiction , which currently is threatening our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; Twin Summit Par@@ adox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain , which thro@@ ws its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the debt , &quot;
yet only a few are recognizing their Gem@@ ini .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is among the wealthy cli@@ ent@@ ers and corporations , who are however too anxious to contribute to where it would be productive and income , with which to wear the debt mountain and also all the things that humanity is urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past 3 months , 3.4 Bil@@ li@@ onen has been put together in the USA , in England and in the euro area , in all the wealth of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , gin , equipment , and so on and so forth . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 Bil@@ li@@ onen U.S. dollar sounds a lot of money until you compare it to the 5,@@ 1 tri@@ llion US dollars , which was at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did except the stock exchange and the property prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , debts and un@@ productive capital is the twin summit , which does not match the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ olds in the U.S. , Japan and Europe , and consequently a low overall economic demand that could not invest in which they don &apos;t invest . just like O@@ dense Father , who would not invest in such a pur@@ ging failure , that his son would kill him if he will grow , &quot;
un@@ will@@ ed the circumstances leads to the cause that eyel@@ ash k@@ ills it k@@ ills .
this is my ha@@ ste with capitalism --
&quot; his extremely dev@@ out species All the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and particularly finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial to rescue the Earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
I believe . but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Ar@@ ist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as a social form in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the ath@@ ic democracy naturally closed too many --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to min@@ ate the significance of the ath@@ ic democracy due to these out@@ crop . &quot;
&quot; the decision of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they were involved in the working arms , and not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and crucial that they had the right to political co @-@ determination with the same vo@@ icing on issues of the state . &quot;
the ath@@ ic democracy has not been held for a long time --
&quot; like a candle , that lit very bright , it is also quick burned . &quot;
&quot; however , our present @-@ liberal democracies have no roots in the ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens and the working arms strengthened , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; because the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of policies and economy is possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , as the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a democratic @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in our contemporary democracies , since the time in which this separation of policies and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two instead of trying to under@@ cut politics and depri@@ ved them . &quot;
do you wonder why the politicians no longer have as before ?
it is not due to the degeneration of their DNA .
&quot; it is because one can still be in the government today , and yet it is not in power , because the power of politics is im@@ migr@@ ated into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my ha@@ ste with capitalism .
&quot; when you think about it , it &apos;s like a flock of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es who are so sustainable the animals , of which she is nourished , dec@@ im@@ ated that she is star@@ ving at the end . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is similar to the economy which politics is so far @-@ Americ@@ an@@ ed by the self @-@ causing economic crisis . the power of corporations is growing , the inequality increases , the overall economic demand falls and the managing director of the corporations are too scar@@ ed to invest the cash of their business . &quot;
&quot; the more successful of capitalism distri@@ butes &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we need to bring the politics and the economy back , and it would be better when the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; control over control , as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and the foreigners . &quot;
this is not a new idea by the way .
the Marxist left had this idea just 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the teaching from the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in the ancient Athens without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is one solution : creating the working arms !
capitalism is doing it by replacing Ni@@ ed@@ ri@@ glo@@ hn@@ tered through automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , autom@@ akers can be higher the twin summit , the extravag@@ ance and the social conflicts deeper , as it is - very soon as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we need to re@@ forming the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and take care of the re@@ unified field of surveillance , otherwise we end the movie &quot; matrix &quot; as a documentary . &quot;
&quot; so the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements , which he has brought forth , survive -- &quot;
&quot; the interesting question is whether capitalism is solved by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &apos; Star Tre@@ k &apos; , similar to the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; or in a high @-@ tech version of the antique Ath@@ ener &quot; A@@ gora , &quot; in long talks the meaning of life . &quot;
I believe we must be optimistic .
&quot; so what do it do , how could it look like this &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ a Utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to tell you , in a nut@@ shell , some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the area of companies : please introduce a capital market in which you get money , while you work and where your capital is followed by a job , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter what you &apos;re working on -- is the property of those who work currently in the company . &quot;
&quot; then all incomes come from capital and from salvation , and the concept of wage labor is completely outdated . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the company , who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but no more exchange between capital and labor , no major gaps between investment and austerity , and ultimately no grand twin summit . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy , please briefly imagine that our national currencies have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all of humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; &quot; cosmos &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos , &quot; -- and every government pays the sum , which corresponds to the trade deficit or trade surplus from each country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that these funds are invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment resources are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference held in 1944 .
the problem was that there was no technical means at that time .
&quot; today , we have them , in particular before the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world that I describe to you is at the same time liber@@ ating , in which she fav@@ ored people , and Marxist , because it is buried the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , globally ke@@ yp@@ an@@ ically . &quot;
but above all others it is a world in which we can imagine a true democracy .
will we aw@@ aken in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we work together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and the economy is ... Do not do this , technological development will generate such a massive decline in economic demand , what Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers is called &quot; long @-@ term stagnation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the transfer of this crisis from a part of the earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing it , it will not only destabili@@ ze our democracies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is correct , Marx is definitely relevant , &quot;
&quot; just as Hay@@ ek , so I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also perfect . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are well . &quot;
Y@@ V : if you are not wir@@ ling you don &apos;t think enough .
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers , you have said very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s view to China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democracies we have the semb@@ lance of a democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics while the area where most of them play , -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in a certain sense , if I may say that pro@@ voc@@ ative , China resembles the England of the 19th century . &quot;
because -- do you remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is an error .
&quot; liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , such as John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical regarding the democratic development .
&quot; what can be observed now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the Industrial Revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; China now throw itself what the West has done in the 19th century , smell to hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many list@@ eners are curious about their experience as Minister of Finance from the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I lon@@ ged that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half @-@ year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; to let us say goodbye to self @-@ suffici@@ ency , and the persistent denial of denial was a massive re@@ prehen@@ sive line by the euro zone , and continues to massi@@ vely attack the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the way , the first proposal was , which revealed this denial -- &quot;
&quot; we have to do it right . unfortunately , the powers within the euro area , within the European group , continue to deny the denial . &quot;
&quot; but you know , what is coming . &quot;
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to get an economic system that is not able to sustain , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , one will perhaps be able to delay a while , but when the change occurs , it happens corrupt and destructive . &quot;
BG : what change do you think ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seriousness ...
&quot; if there is a Minister of Finance , or any Minister , who claimed after 6 months in office , especially in such a tense situation , he did not make mistakes , then that is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they just wanted to bring our government to fall only because they did not want to deal with the obj@@ ections that ran through the Eurozone .
they did not want to conce@@ de that they had a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; none of the tro@@ ika creditors , who imposed us this policy , and a : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal f@@ arious mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive sound of the talks , you seem to be still quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone towards someone who lives and loves Europe .
my greatest fear is that the eurozone is not survived .
&quot; for if they fail to survive , the shared plane forces will be suspi@@ cious and the European Union will destroy . &quot;
&quot; this will not be disastrous for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; when we mo@@ ver ourselves to hit the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what it seems to me , it will be as toler@@ able for the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you so much that you were at TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thanks .
&quot; Roy Price have never heard the majority , even though he is probably responsible for twenty @-@ moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
this is going back to the decision taken by Roy three years ago .
&quot; Roy Price is leading provider at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the TV @-@ production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an ino@@ cul@@ ation and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
&quot; Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for bringing the shows and the content , producing the Amazon . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a very hard working industry . &quot;
there are already so many TV series that Roy is unable to select any one .
&quot; he has to find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are quite right on this curve . &quot;
this curve is the rating distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ D@@ b website . the rating is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review .
&quot; if your show is valued at nine and higher , it is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; &quot; Bre@@ aking Bad &quot; , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that addic@@ ted , when you looked at a season , your brain asked : &quot; where is there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left , here at this end , shows shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry about coming into the left side of the curve , because I think you have a particular intelligence to provide &quot; To@@ dd@@ ler and Ti@@ aras &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he is doing more thoughts about the average explo@@ iting , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they do not am@@ a@@ ze . &quot;
so he must ensure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it is also the first time Amazon does something that doesn &apos;t want to risk Roy Price . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and chosen by a evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produced the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online , where everyone can watch them for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon are out of vain things , is it going to be right ? &quot;
millions of viewers look at these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed at the viewing of these shows . &quot;
they are observed by Roy and his team who record everything .
&quot; you can capture when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you start jumping or check again . &quot;
&quot; you collect millions of data to decide with these data , which show they should produce . &quot;
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process these and from it arises the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com above four re@@ public@@ s sen@@ ators . &quot;
you made this show .
does someone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems not many can remember this show because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average of this curve 7,@@ 4 amounts to and Alpha House lan@@ ted on average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super @-@ show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a different way . &quot;
&quot; instead of holding a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give the shows , their course , what shows they like , etc . &quot;
then you use this information to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like about which producers they actors .
&quot; when they had together all the parts , they entered a wagon and decided not to make a Sit@@ com above four Sen@@ ators but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has hit a hit with it , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; is given a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
&quot; of course , the question is : what is happening here ? &quot;
&quot; you have two very competitive , data sealed companies . &quot;
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that in all it should work .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision that you meet , you should make a good decision . &quot;
man has more than 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
you are optimized by very powerful computers .
&quot; the minus what you can expect is good TV , or ? &quot;
&quot; when data analysis does not work so , this is a bit scary because we live in a time in which we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does someone know the company multi @-@ health system ?
&quot; no . OK , this is even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one gets in this space ever in touch with this software . come in touch , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in prison in prison and ask for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dis@@ mis@@ sal is done or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad , it &apos;s decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; average television , 22 minutes , which can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results will be created . this is not because a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
even the most rep@@ uted companies are sometimes wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 Google announced that through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the terrible kind , can be predicted -- through data analysis of the Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderfully well and was a big message sensation . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked perfectly well , year round year until it suddenly wasn &apos;t working , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it just didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data most rep@@ uted companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all of these errors , data have accumulated in decisions of life -- on the workplace , in case of legal action , in medicine . &quot;
&quot; so , we should be sure to ensure that data is helpful . &quot;
&quot; I also know lots of trouble with data . I work in computer @-@ assisted genetics -- an area where some smart people un@@ thin@@ kable many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a medication . over the years I have detected some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; you have to solve a complex problem , do mainly two things : &quot;
&quot; as the first , you place this problem in its parts , so that you can analyze the items ; as Z@@ ones you put the items together again to summar@@ ise a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : taking apart and put together . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help a problem or understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to add the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we all possess it all : our brain .
&quot; when there is something in which the brain is good , it &apos;s parts and pieces to get together again , even if the information is incomplete , to then put a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s why I believe it was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have used data and minds , where they are also in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience what they otherwise wouldn &apos;t have been capable of . but the decision , how to take all these parts , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; which was not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show that meant she entered a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all of their decisions , first when they chose TV ideas , then they chose &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; as show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; &quot; they say to us the dates . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe that things go wrong when data begin to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and not to forget it , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question , you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot;
&quot; later , I will carry out it with a Techni@@ k@@ demo@@ lition . &quot;
&quot; I have made some decisions in my life so far , whereby I should have heard on the ball in retrosp@@ ect . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know of course , when you have the data available , you would like to replace them through something much cl@@ and@@ escent , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; maybe the ball will be wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right . &quot;
&quot; I think this as a very encouraging message , that despite the large amount of data still pays off to make decisions to be an expert in what one is doing , and risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thanks beautiful .
