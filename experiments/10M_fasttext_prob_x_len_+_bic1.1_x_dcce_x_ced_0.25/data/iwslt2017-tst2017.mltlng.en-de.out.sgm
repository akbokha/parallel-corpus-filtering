<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New-York reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone heard about Edward Snowden, wrote a book in which he was spectacular, that the NSA had listened to illegally from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is another chapter, which should leave a lasting impression."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence co-operation where the CIA was literally drained by Iran for an atomic bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible history.</seg>
<seg id="8">"but, do you know who the chapter was not covered?"</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government had determined against risen and called on it to name its alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this train, he became a symbol for the design of the government, whistleblowers to condemn and journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to First Constitutional Treaty, the media have the right to release secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to use this right, if media cannot get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the mud that they should do."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government sought after Risen, he did something that many brave reporters did before him, he refused, and said he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, rationing lived with the risk of going to prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the process, something exceptional."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, though she had been indications for years that it would be vital for their case, the demands of the government in Risen were dropped."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporter and springs can hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rather than trying to fail and bring up Risen for statements, this might also do its digital footprints for it."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators have secretly, without his consent, his telephone calls for secret,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, its credit ratings, and even travel notes with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistle-blower and risens."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised at his victory, to protect whistle-blowers. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government has too much of their work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of whistleblower to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work in the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional report, because the government has more possibilities to pierce all of them."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as the technology of the government allowed the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and indeed, they can turn it from the moment in which they engage in contact, rather than in retrospect, in witness."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software, which there has not yet been when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than regular e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source control system for whistleblowers, which was originally developed from the internet famous, which has been developed by us received Aaron Swartz, and is now been developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news-site, like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, just like every ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so, the government can no longer obtain information secretly, and many of the information they would request would not be available from the start."</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spy technology that endanger us all."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is to ensure that not only technology specialist, such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to bring Missetters. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"who knows about mishes in the supply of soldiers and wants to report from crowded hospitals, or the next environmental worker, the alarm to the contaminated water of flint. or a wall-insider that warns us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">"[on 3 April 2016, the biggest data leck of the story was released.] [the" "Panama Papers" "contained that friction and moderation] have hidden in tax havens.] [what does this mean?] [we bate Robert Palmer from Global Wacker by a statement.] This week we were based on messages about a leak of 11 million documents of the" "lawyers" "Mosbag Fonseca."</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers are going to firms like Mosbag Fonseca and say," okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works, as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad stamp-firms in tax havens has.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of children's days, one of the famous cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people out there, and others are waiting to wait for the next release, and the next revealed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agency's tent or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems crying away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we address this?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is, if the rich and powerful ones are able to hide their assets in tax havens and do not pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, global wool, these revelations have been phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"throughout the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used by a few of them to hide and conceal their assets - something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think so many people this whole world appears very confusing, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens function."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always put it like a Matrjoschkapuche.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so one has a company in another company, in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters is."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that in the US there are fewer reports on this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably, because there were no prominent Americans in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now, it is not that there are no wealthy Americans who hide their assets in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle of which these tax havens function, Mosbag Fonseca has less American clients."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we would have a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that in some US-states you need less information to give less information to create a company than to obtain a librarian."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparence in the US has allowed employees of deboules to pick up school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">Cheers has allowed cheers to pick especially susceptible investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global WOL we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it actually work?</seg>
<seg id="73">"so we sent a secret investigator to the offices of 13 Lawyers in Manhattan, Germany."</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator gave himself an African Minister, who wanted to bring the suspects money to the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"it really shocked us that all have made up suggestions for an attorney to our investigator, how he could transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all pretense. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was handed over to money. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as a case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covert investigation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single class of leaders, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, established by the corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we must change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"it may sound everything very dull, as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing ever had changed; as if there is always the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as secure optimist, I fully see that a lot of things started to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years we have seen impulses towards more transparency, as regards the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The subject took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU is captured in central registers at the national level who really lies behind companies in Europe and who controls it."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have introduced a bill's draft in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure more transparency in the U.S. and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Wana this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headboards."</seg>
<seg id="93">We need managers in the economy to get up and say: "Intransparence is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">"we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it, through laws to end this kind of intransparence."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finally finish the Intransparence, which now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">That is the story of how I had almost abducted almost abducted and the trunk of a red mazema.</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I finished my design study, I made a backyard sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy stayed in the red mazda and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">"he was alone in the city, and just made a road trip across the country. afterwards, he would go to the peace corps."</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "where do you sleep today?"</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing worse," "I don't know."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I need to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know it! he said that he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to land the trunk of a mazap!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," "h, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was in bed, I stared at the ceiling, and thought," "Oh man! what I have broken down to me?"</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild estranft in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such fear that I rose out of bed, moved to toe at tiptoes, and my sleeping door closed."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">"the artwork, which he had bought from me is today in his classroom. he is now a teacher."</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my perspective.</seg>
<seg id="121">"maybe the people who were sold to me in childhood as foreigners, actually friends, who only waited to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"to accommodate people on my air mattress, it was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"we take a time-jump, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost pleite, my roommate attracts and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I think, creativity can create it, fear in fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I got over how we could earn something about it. our apartment will stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including, including a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep at the air mattress at wooden floors for 20 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="131">"they found it super, and we too."</seg>
<seg id="132">"I am sure our cheese-ham Omelet tasted completely different, because we made them for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them all the city. when we passed our last guest, and the door to the castle fell, rigid Brian and I sat down."</seg>
<seg id="134">We just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as developers."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if one could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented our Investors:" we want to create a site on which people post on publicly images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the Internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still at comfort, would invest in a business, allowed strangers to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children have all learned that foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, one besses on the things that you can do. we could be designed."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to designate objects, but now we wanted to create trust through design immense trust, between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Design can design such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a precious sample the degree you trust we have.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">"now, I would like to unlock your cell phone."</seg>
<seg id="156">Type your entail mobile phone to your left sitting.</seg>
<seg id="157">"this quietly flight flight from panic, which you are now feeling -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the door the first time."</seg>
<seg id="158">"because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile, is your home."</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the bulky phone of a stranger in the hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"so, most guests feel when they stay elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"only then, who now has Al Gores mobile?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you proclaim on Twitter that he gives president to the President's Office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a little detail of this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbour had first presented with his name; when he tells, where he comes, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"imagine you would have 150 ratings, which all say," "he really can hold very well-red mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to leave your cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-thought feedback system reinforces the confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for the people to give negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">"ultimately, we decided to wait until both Hosts and Guest had given their votes before we asked them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we have conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are regarding age and housing."</seg>
<seg id="178">A little surprisingly we trust the people most who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">"in our case, it is exciting when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case through assessments."</seg>
<seg id="182">"if one has less than three acts, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but one has more than ten, changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation is common in common.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted likes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"moreover, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you can expect from there."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell a bit like" "hi!", "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells you too much, such as:" "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request will be rather not accepted. "</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal level of openness, for example 'wool artworks in your apartment! I make holiday with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">"we use the size of the text box to recommend the correct amount of text, and we also give tips on which subjects you should write."</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company is based on hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="194">"with what we had not reckoned, the large amount of people who were more than willing to lay these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">"second, the tireless work of our team."</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, a need which was not covered before."</seg>
<seg id="200">The business is running very well for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have unallowed parties havoiced or dwelled.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">"I stood at the front front, if trust was broken."</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing scarlimmeres than these calls. it already hurts when I only think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the Anrufer, was and will always be our greatest motivation to improve ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, the 123 million paid nights had only a fraction of the problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people are familiar to one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">"if trust works, we can arise out."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host was driving him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">It even split blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers, who tend to be dynasty because of sitting activities."</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real preserves, which save one life, even though they don't know at all."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you will drive one in your own car into the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they do not want you feel lonely, they bring books over."</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even leave a longer stay without charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So of course not every stay will run away.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled about this term for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with cash flow?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is here about an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but it is now just a" "car industry", "the thing is not justified."</seg>
<seg id="228">"Share Economy describes a trade, which promises human relationships."</seg>
<seg id="229">People place a part of themselves open and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"when one travels nowadays, it is compared with Fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but it is less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">But what would be if traveling a rich buffet of local impressions would be?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what would be if at any location one visits a group there, Ansässiger would wait to fill a thoroughly and one at a pub-pentine district, one of which has never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could enjoy cooking of a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"today, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to design apartments from the ground up to together?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would take the idea of a shared share?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that enable us to serve society and relationships, instead of loneliness and depreciation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korean capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces, which belonged to the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">"were offered by the residents. students, who were looking for a lead,"</seg>
<seg id="241">Were launched to people whose children were raised up. they were started Incubator programs.</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. through our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest at a stranger or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be not as crazy as it was introduced to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality also existed before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from luck and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I think that is amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">Every time I have to think about when a red mazda goes over to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design can not solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder why we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A faithful? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"repressed, subjected to brain-washing, a terrorist list?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the fault for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">The media represents people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not speak to their uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for those who have never met Muslims, it is great to meet you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted;</seg>
<seg id="271">A glove-like-fitness fan-fanatists, "</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga, because, baby, I was not born so."</seg>
<seg id="274">I have chosen this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old I decided to ouw my decision.</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as homosexual human beings, as some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the Hijab, my headgear."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist friends were horrified," why oppressed you yourself? "</seg>
<seg id="278">"the somber was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, and in comparison to the pressure which I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt me to a perfect and unreachable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, according to him, imagined, and ultimately believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow devotion that deepened with every reading of the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I see myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that someone you perceives you fully understands and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"I married and began, like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"I later had, after my marriage, a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian American Dream "dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that horrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I was sitting in my kitchen, had an early breakfast, looked at the screen and saw the word" Eillover. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, planes flown in buildings, people spitting from the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into rebellion.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I switched on the television channel and heard:"... "Muslim terrorists"... "..." in the name of Islam... "..."... "..."... "..."... ""... ""... ""... "</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it has not only been attacked my country, but in the Nu transformed me the actions of others from a civil war into a suspects."</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day we had to drive through the US West to move into a new city and begin studying.</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember, as I went digging -- so deep it went up into my seat, and I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we went to our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then heard, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said," "be watchful", "" "be vigilant," "lead in well-lighted areas," "seedling you not."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">"then there was Friday in that week -- the day, in which Muslims gather for prayer."</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a destination."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage of this.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably filtered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or the people that one held for Muslims, warmed free and struck."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked the country had attacked our land.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have repelled the fury of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain themselves constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">The accusations are tough.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can actually say people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to join Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It only poses the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor can be removed as a whole and a benign tumor just under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is false.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventor and teacher of first-gatherers and Olympionids.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America be safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"it might be released a few parking spaces, but not stop terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to the people of other faiths, tolerant persons, and to show greater citizenship."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the Washington, DC recently told, people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"when the radicalization process has been found that he begins online. as a First, the person is cut off from her church, so that the person believes that the person feels the true Muslims, and anyone who despises their behavior and their ideology is a traitor, or faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalization, we need to stop the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Quran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">"but we would add to their imagination, when one acknowledges it as representatives of 1.6 billion believers."</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but if one throws a look at it, it is not driving them what they read in their" Holy Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">"a girl came to him, because she had imagined to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was exactly the opposite. any clergy with whom she had spoken, she brought her to the silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense to their anger, it was a main objective for the instrumentalisation by extremists who promised a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam turned the connection to God and her church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing it for their anger he showed her constructive way for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, kept it before joining the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">It was an insight into how the Islamophobia lead me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">"how affects the 24-hour consumption of fear every day on our democracy, to our freedom of thought?"</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, happen at least three things. "</seg>
<seg id="359">We are rather an authoritarian government system conformance and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study reveals: if you examine reviews, in which negative about Muslims was reported, they signify rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look when the mood for Muslims led to the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the advance of the Iraq war and during the two periods of the election.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Mozlem-terrorist, as I expected it."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool to manipulation the public to spread the foundations of a free society, the rational and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may sense it as the first, but the toxic air of fear keeps us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collectivism it is not just about to explain themselves to oneself.</seg>

<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne in her brother and his wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan that was in the afternoon when he posted statements against Muslims on his facebook page."</seg>

<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be immoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Have we gone to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we boarded it, and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about how America we left to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can exercise our religion freely."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's seat, we headed silent, with high pressure on the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"and I took him out, my shoes went out, went into prayer, and what I saw, caused me to stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then, the Imam made an announcement, thanked her and was called our guests, for half of the gathered Christians were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Atheists, believers and non-believers who had come to attack us, but to join us."</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and sympathy of panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose from the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go on number sure?</seg>

<seg id="412">They have learned to bear the burden to deal with turmoil and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to cross the limits of Possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"thus, a system of autonomous functions, it must know collectively, where in the room the mobile objects are located."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at the ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamical tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, a company of our laboratories."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each air-machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space, Calculations on board, which should do the machine."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available at the highest level. e.g.," "start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called Heckstarter.</seg>
<seg id="422">"a airfield, which tries to beat two flies with a cap."</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient in advance flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all their variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most of the starter forces, it can float, and thus has great advantages in start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of Heckers is that they react to turbulence like wind arches.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">"the idea behind it is that the aircraft, no matter what position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing."</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often ask ourselves basic abstract issues that penetrate to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the smaller number of moveable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are approximately known as machines with a thousand moving parts that gather together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained pilot-controlled air devices could fly, which only had two movable parts: a propeller and a tailoring."</seg>
<seg id="435">"recently, we discovered that flying with only one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monbuinner that is the mechanically simplest air device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only a moving part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no valves, hinges and cross-section, no further actuation or control surfaces, only a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, in interior live very much, so that it can fly stably and move in space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tailgate. to get it to flying, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood to throw it right when all of me watch is small, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"when the moon is a practice in simplicity, this machine is here, the omnihead-ter with its eight provers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this passage?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">"therefore, he is ambivalent in his direction."</seg>
<seg id="446">"thus, he receives the proper ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"move in the room in all directions, no matter what direction it is rotated or even as it rotating."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, he is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight provers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some is able in models, the rest will be learned directly from flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying parts are to be part of our daily life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is composed of two separate two-propellers.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates in the clockwise direction</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"if one builds it together, they act like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, a little bit wrong -- an engine or propeller falls off, the electronic or a battery, the machine can continue to fly, if restricted."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate that by doing half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swarming.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, co-ordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took retail micro-quadcopter -- every single weighs less than one disc bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you will motivate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine as drens want to be on Broadway to become a flattendant parachute.</seg>

<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional as this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the departure from my Todill father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"basically, they were the fruits of my life."</seg>
<seg id="492">"all that, for which I had worked, is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretic physicist at MIT. he studied gravitational signals from black holes and their by observatories as LIGO measurable signals. but what are the gravitational waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a clusal in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when passing the shaft, the space and its entire contents are stretched towards a direction and into the other hand."</seg>
<seg id="495">"in addition to the illustration, lecturers in courses for the Relativity Theory are often a true alberty dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dust, stretch and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on 14 September, for example, each of us was stretched by the waves of the waves and stripped. the stretching of an average person was 10 high-21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that is said 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a first Darum, one declared the LIGO staff for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometers long laser-detector, and that is absurd, this length would have to be exactly measured on less than a thousandth of a atom radius. that is grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text on gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"described Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGO, the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties in building such detectors are tremendous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"however, physicists are gloomically and with the support of the public, certainly all obstacles will be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this success in 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">"back to LIGO. Scott maintains, LIGO may be more like an eye than an eye."</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facial extracts, the size of your mobile phones. "</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite handy. for this way you can make a picture or a map of things by watching the light around you from several points.</seg>
<seg id="509">With potholes this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that's why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean you especially much:"</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead we listen to certain characteristics such as toning and height, rhythm and volume, to close the history behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, Alice speaks Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">And Bob breaks her.</seg>
<seg id="516">"swimmers Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">With them we cannot produce simple pictures of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by respecting changes in the amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for LIGO the measured frequencies are in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so if we convert wave pattern in all, we can literally speak all literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"to listen to the gravity, it can tell us about a collision of two black holes, with what my colleague Scott has been working for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, not revolving holes, round-off: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning on the two bodies very quickly you hear the same circle with an additional sound change. this sounds so on: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement, engraved in the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date, that at least I will never forget -- hearing LIGO follower: [Surrenal noise], who knows what he has to hear, can see this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with the 30-facher solar mass, which revolve around as fast as the sticks of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: do we consider ourselves briefly what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the dense body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve each hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent significance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">"LIGO paves a completely new way to explore the Alls, as never was possible before."</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much at All we can -- virtually or basically -- not visible.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a super-nova, for example. I would like to know why mask stars explode in super-novae."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"the exciting physical processes occur but at the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers from iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through this opak.</seg>
<seg id="540">"the gravitational-waves penetrate iron, as if it would be transparent glass. the Urbang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it as the Urbang is covered through his own neighbour."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using gravitational waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen before, and of which we have no idea of. things that we only discover, by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, LIGO found equal in the first attempt things we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this issue: Me: the kind of stars, the black holes emerge, like LIGO they observe, are the dinosaurs of the Universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, age-old bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are the sauerbones for our archeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"LIGO gives us a completely different point of view on what is happening in all, on the origin of the stars and ultimately to how we came out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now exists to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to LIGo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatory - a whole new generation of observatories on earth and in space.</seg>

<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>

<seg id="556">"whether it made me nervous, in unpleasant situations, I forced me to say" "yes". ""</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be on TV live?</seg>
<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">Wanted to start with the swing?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, but yes, yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: exactly what to do, I feared, washed my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear to keep talking, my social fear -- Puff, gone."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes, has changed my life."</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," changed me. "</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes that deeply changed my life on an unexpected article. it started with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for unavowed reasons all" estimations, "</seg>
<seg id="570">As if they were a waitress from the South.</seg>
<seg id="571">"estimates, I need milk for my beak-dog breed."</seg>
<seg id="572">She once asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the go. and I said: "yes.</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"a new attitude to my family. from then I swear to myself, always play with them as soon as you ask me for it. no matter what I just do, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I am not perfect, but I am trying so much."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a daunting side-effect: first I understood actually completely that the "Yes" saws to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think of things out of life and look back to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I Cream TV. I produced television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make television, in great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV-season I'm responsible for being able to carry out 70 hours of the program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">"four television programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Every shipment offers hundreds of jobs that previously didn't exist.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television senders can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode all nine days in four shows, i.e. all nine days 20 million TV, four television programs, four hours TV, three shows: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 hours television,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for one season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my television series are running on Thursdays.</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series will run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I myself created, and not only produced, so still prevailing. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four television series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfire, which burn around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who that is still doing?</seg>
<seg id="598">"nobody, that is why I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it, because I know what you think when the word" author "falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you so all of you who work so hard, whether you're a company, a country or a home classroom, a business or a household, take me seriously if I say, I understand that I don't just get around on the computer and fantasiere, and it is true when I say, I understand that it's not dreaming in a dreary job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, everything reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work much, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I am absorbed into the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, when turned troops up, then I painted on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"for example, one sees a high tone, lying a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanically, tiring and intoxicating, funny and troubled, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible. and the best thing is that is the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzz begins in my head, and it grows and growing, and the buzz hears as a bustling street, I could go on her forever."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume that when I declare to them the buzz, that I talked to writing that writing should give me a pleasure."</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the buzz -- when I began to work with television production, when I began to work and work, build and work together, I discovered this matter, this amount, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The buzz is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums are action and activity. the sums of money is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The buzz of God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a buzz, then you cannot strive for any different size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feeling, not to be different than to seek size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is the ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I know only that I am not made for failure, and I just know that I love the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I will only say to you, I am a Titan, and I know I will not ask it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make it clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more abounds, the more work there are, the more I write history, the more I write history, the more expectations there is."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, do not come true?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land, which I survived, the marathon, I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like that sums. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only that buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overhauled, overloaded, exaggerated, burned."</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">"now, my three daughters are used to the truth that her mother is a single worker."</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my mother will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says," estimation, I want to go to Shonda country. "</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of an Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are a baby-titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the totals stopped."</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzz of the engine was mute.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as usual: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, messed weekends, no remorant, no reviewer, a Titan sleeps, does not exist, with all heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four television programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a pre-show-Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think:" "hay you out, blaming the author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you are doing what you are doing is to be a banker to be a servant, a mother who knows, and knows how the buzz stops, when the buzz stops, who is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart listens, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states" waitress. "</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way out, late, and she says," Mama, you're playing? "</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to tell no things when two things are aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she called me not."</seg>
<seg id="675">It is no longer called an assessment. "</seg>
<seg id="676">When is that happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I'm Titan and my sums were sad, and here everything is changing in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," Mama, you are playing? "</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book 'Everybody Poops'."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and the absence of the Summon, can I do nothing but to match."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the land, which I survived, the marathon, I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists are sticky fingers and humid kisses, delicate voices, vigilant and the song in which it's going to release, or whatever the girl in" The Ice Queen "release."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Play is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me is solving.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door is going on and an energy shoub comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that is not immediately, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums are slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzz, but a buzz. "</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magic secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us remain with the cause.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the buzz, the workmen, the titanium dioxide, this is just the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself using broadcasts and TV lessons, and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums of money is not a force and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depend on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums of money is the stream that comes from the joy of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real sums ignored the pressure of the story, the performing tasks, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps whispered God the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">Once my child wants to play with me I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I am doing this as a firm rule so that I can rid myself as a workaholic of any fault.</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice, unless I want to hear the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I am not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">Play does not play to me as well as working.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does hurt</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like it to play.</seg>
<seg id="724">"I always work, because I love it."</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this concession is painful, because what a person would rather work than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well yes, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of that.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rasen in the garden, before and back, away and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we are making small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play Ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We disflaccid soap-bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"at the same time, I feel mainly stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always use my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe meet me."</seg>
<seg id="739">"I play and play, until I ask myself: why have we ever ceased with the Games?"</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! tell them always yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you hold me for naïve, for a day-dreamer."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you are probably right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you also know why? you are not Rihanna or a muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting when you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes, until they get up to them that they want something different."</seg>
<seg id="748">"there are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes I will replace a Marienkins or Keks.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and says my teeny-daughter all 15 minutes with me, I am mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more needs it not."</seg>
<seg id="752">"each can bring 15 minutes a bit, even on a bad mood!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a bit!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: diner to get the kids ready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are possible!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my wellness, my world. you do not have to be the children. it is good to feel the buzz, to have a place for his soul peace."</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not about playing with their own children. it is about joy</seg>
<seg id="759">About "play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Get yourself the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what is good for you.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I am not perfect in it. I shaded and I siege. friends meet, reading books to enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"want to play?" "just for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show, when I got a Titan in education, when I wanted to outperform myself more and more."</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the piece why don't get full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can it be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums come back in my free time. the sums seem to return if I do not work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unfamiliar melody, it fulfils me and my soul. it tempts me to new ideas. I use it to the fullest and love my work again."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the buzz, but I do not love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the buzz of the sums you don't know... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap-bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends. "</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The buzz of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sums of work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful."</seg>
<seg id="778">"it is me that I have a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, the journey to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and to play more.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my campfire are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the more happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the more clearly my head."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the buzz. the country that I drive, the marathon, I run, the amount, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz, the sums of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this sums, the more this unusual, preserved, naked and new feeling of life in me wide. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel like this, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am author. I think of things, I awake you to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"this belongs to the job, which means to live his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"I said" "yes" "to get less work and to play more."</seg>
<seg id="793">There were no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">"like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a serious stroke or an automobile accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeon, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe violation of the central nervous system, patients often have a sustained, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I have functional neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a Functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">"sure, they have heard of one of the most prominent, the" "low-stag stimulation." in doing so, one can influence a electrode deep in the brain to influence the shifting circles of neurons so that the neurological function improves. "</seg>
<seg id="805">It truly is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson who suffered under heavy teats and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"Neuromodulation, however, does not mean Neuro-healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was leading Oberdoctor and worked night and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I used patients with skull-Hirn trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that at skull-Hirn-traun-traumas the brain tends to increase and the skull shift increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, one has to diminish the skull-pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">Therefore you sometimes have to remove a part of your brain's brain.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away brain mass, we decided to analyze with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to let cells from a tissue game grow, comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"it is necessary to find the proper diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to flourish."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it managed Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, that are surrounded by small, unmature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you know from the BiologieLearning that stem cells are unripe cells which can turn into any cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells have behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">"they slowly shared themselves and after a couple of weeks, they even died."</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, weird cell-population, which looked like stem cells, but kept different."</seg>
<seg id="837">"we needed long to understand, where they came."</seg>
<seg id="838">These are from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells hot Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our big-stag-rinses.</seg>
<seg id="842">You play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">"in the stage of the fetus, they ensure the brains of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="844">But why stay they preserved us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain, as we find it close to brain injury to higher concentrations."</seg>
<seg id="847">This is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">"we are facing a potential cell source, which allows brain healing."</seg>
<seg id="850">This is what we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">"so, we decided to develop an experiment."</seg>
<seg id="852">"we wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non-language area, and then cultivate the cells in the same way as Jean-François did."</seg>
<seg id="853">And they subsequently mark colour to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we plunged it to the appendental of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we cut these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we cut the same cells into razed brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with ape."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario, we cut cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely disappeared as if they were taken back home. the room is already occupied, they will not disappear, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we added a violation of and cut down the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew up to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been cut down.</seg>
<seg id="862">"evidence that they show are these small points. these are the cells which we danced in vitro, in the culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">"help these cells also have a monkey, to recover from a brain lesion?"</seg>
<seg id="865">"thus, we prepared monkeys with a manual skill purpose."</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take feed pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they had achieved a stable skill level, we injured in the motic cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"as a result, the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen to people, they spontaneously sit down to some degree, just as after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of sculptural mechanisms. it will be a certain degree, just like the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left side they see the monkey, who recovered spontaneously."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, see when we cut cells cut down: the same aping, two months after the plantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that was also for us very exciting results.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found out a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use it in other neuropathological models, for example with Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream still is to implanted them with people.</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope that I can show you soon, how the human brain gives the means to heal yourself."</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, which is wonderful, I am sure that right now, several dozen people in the crowd, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who can need it. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question of what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at human beings."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look to the future -- you have completed research and trying to get the permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone gets into the hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will allow us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it needs a long time to select the patients to perform and evaluate the treatments, whether it is useful to make this sort of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, you have to apply this to a multi-centric study."</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first prove that it's useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to look at them as natural.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality, but as inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as immutable truths.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism leads inevitably to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing have doubtlessly proved that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while the policy remains entirely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy overcomes with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- not likely to influence the austerity programmes in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my upbringing friends, which would repeats to me that democracy would change."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to present you an economic model for genuine democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you to believe in common with me, again to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save democracy, but that we may need a true and defenceltic democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy our societies are avoided, our future gloomy, and our great, new technologies wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to refer you to an interesting contradiction, which currently is threatening our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "Twin Summit Paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain, which throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the debt,"</seg>
<seg id="918">Yet only a few are recognizing their Gemini.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which is among the wealthy clienters and corporations, who are however too anxious to contribute to where it would be productive and income, with which to wear the debt mountain and also all the things that humanity is urgently needed, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past 3 months, 3.4 Billionen has been put together in the USA, in England and in the euro area, in all the wealth of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, gin, equipment, and so on and so forth."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 Billionen U.S. dollar sounds a lot of money until you compare it to the 5,1 trillion US dollars, which was at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did except the stock exchange and the property prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debts and unproductive capital is the twin summit, which does not match the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-olds in the U.S., Japan and Europe, and consequently a low overall economic demand that could not invest in which they don't invest. just like Odense Father, who would not invest in such a purging failure, that his son would kill him if he will grow,"</seg>
<seg id="925">Unwilled the circumstances leads to the cause that eyelash kills it kills.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my haste with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"his extremely devout species All the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and particularly finance all the technologies," green "technologies that are crucial to rescue the Earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I believe. but before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as a social form in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The athic democracy naturally closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to minate the significance of the athic democracy due to these outcrop."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision of the Athenian democracy was and is that they were involved in the working arms, and not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and crucial that they had the right to political co-determination with the same voicing on issues of the state."</seg>
<seg id="935">The athic democracy has not been held for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, that lit very bright, it is also quick burned."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our present-liberal democracies have no roots in the ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens and the working arms strengthened, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"because the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of policies and economy is possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, as the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a democratic-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our contemporary democracies, since the time in which this separation of policies and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two instead of trying to undercut politics and deprived them."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians no longer have as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to the degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because one can still be in the government today, and yet it is not in power, because the power of politics is immigrated into the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my haste with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"when you think about it, it's like a flock of carnivores who are so sustainable the animals, of which she is nourished, decimated that she is starving at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is similar to the economy which politics is so far-Americaned by the self-causing economic crisis. the power of corporations is growing, the inequality increases, the overall economic demand falls and the managing director of the corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their business."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful of capitalism distributes" Demos "[the people] from democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if this is true, it is obvious that we need to bring the politics and the economy back, and it would be better when the" Demos "control over control, as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and the foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea by the way.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea just 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The teaching from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in the ancient Athens without creating new ways of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: creating the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism is doing it by replacing Niedriglohntered through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automakers can be higher the twin summit, the extravagance and the social conflicts deeper, as it is - very soon as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we need to reforming the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and take care of the reunified field of surveillance, otherwise we end the movie" matrix "as a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"so the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements, which he has brought forth, survive --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the interesting question is whether capitalism is solved by a dystopia, similar to the 'Star Trek', similar to the society in" Star Trek, "or in a high-tech version of the antique Athener" Agora, "in long talks the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what do it do, how could it look like this" star Trek "-a Utopia instead of the" matrix "similar dystopia?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to tell you, in a nutshell, some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of companies: please introduce a capital market in which you get money, while you work and where your capital is followed by a job, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter what you're working on -- is the property of those who work currently in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then all incomes come from capital and from salvation, and the concept of wage labor is completely outdated."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the company, who do not work in it, and employees who work there, but no more exchange between capital and labor, no major gaps between investment and austerity, and ultimately no grand twin summit."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy, please briefly imagine that our national currencies have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" "cosmos", "in units of" Cosmos, "-- and every government pays the sum, which corresponds to the trade deficit or trade surplus from each country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that these funds are invested in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment resources are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference held in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that there was no technical means at that time.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, in particular before the background of a reunified policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world that I describe to you is at the same time liberating, in which she favored people, and Marxist, because it is buried the separation of capital and labour in the dustbin of history, and Keynesian, globally keypanically."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world in which we can imagine a true democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we work together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography itself as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and the economy is... Do not do this, technological development will generate such a massive decline in economic demand, what Larry Summers is called" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"through the transfer of this crisis from a part of the earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing it, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is correct, Marx is definitely relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"just as Hayek, so I am a libertarian Marxist, and as Keynes, and therefore I am also perfect."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: actually, and now we are well."</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not wirling you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers, you have said very clearly what you think of the West's view to China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the semblance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics while the area where most of them play, -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a certain sense, if I may say that provocative, China resembles the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- do you remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that is an error.</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, liberals, such as John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical regarding the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what can be observed now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the Industrial Revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"China now throw itself what the West has done in the 19th century, smell to hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experience as Minister of Finance from the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I longed that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later to the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"to let us say goodbye to self-sufficiency, and the persistent denial of denial was a massive reprehensive line by the euro zone, and continues to massively attack the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the way, the first proposal was, which revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"we have to do it right. unfortunately, the powers within the euro area, within the European group, continue to deny the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">"but you know, what is coming."</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to get an economic system that is not able to sustain, through political will and authoritarianism in life, one will perhaps be able to delay a while, but when the change occurs, it happens corrupt and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change do you think?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a Minister of Finance, or any Minister, who claimed after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, he did not make mistakes, then that is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"of course, I made mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the donors to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They just wanted to bring our government to fall only because they did not want to deal with the objections that ran through the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to concede that they had a catastrophic programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"none of the troika creditors, who imposed us this policy, and a:" that was a colossal farious mistake. "</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive sound of the talks, you seem to be still quite pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone towards someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the eurozone is not survived.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if they fail to survive, the shared plane forces will be suspicious and the European Union will destroy."</seg>

<seg id="1038">"Roy Price have never heard the majority, even though he is probably responsible for twenty-moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">This is going back to the decision taken by Roy three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">"Roy Price is leading provider at Amazon Studios,"</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has an inoculation and describes himself on Twitter as" movies, TV, technology, tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">"Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for bringing the shows and the content, producing the Amazon."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard working industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy is unable to select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are quite right on this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IMDb website. the rating is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is valued at nine and higher, it is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" "Breaking Bad", "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that addicted, when you looked at a season, your brain asked:" where is there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left, here at this end, shows shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not worry about coming into the left side of the curve, because I think you have a particular intelligence to provide" Toddler and Tiaras "." "</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he is doing more thoughts about the average exploiting, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they do not amaze."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must ensure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it is also the first time Amazon does something that doesn't want to risk Roy Price."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he keeps a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and chosen by a evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produced the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online, where everyone can watch them for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon are out of vain things, is it going to be right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are observed at the viewing of these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you can capture when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you start jumping or check again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">"you collect millions of data to decide with these data, which show they should produce."</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process these and from it arises the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a sitcom above four republics senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">You made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does someone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems not many can remember this show because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- since the average of this curve 7,4 amounts to and Alpha House lanted on average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super-show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a different way."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of holding a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give the shows, their course, what shows they like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then you use this information to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like about which producers they actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had together all the parts, they entered a wagon and decided not to make a Sitcom above four Senators but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," "House of Cards". Netflix has hit a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons. "</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" is given a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what is happening here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"you have two very competitive, data sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that in all it should work.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision that you meet, you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">Man has more than 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You are optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the minus what you can expect is good TV, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"when data analysis does not work so, this is a bit scary because we live in a time in which we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does someone know the company multi-health system?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no. OK, this is even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one gets in this space ever in touch with this software. come in touch, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison in prison and ask for dismissal, it is likely that data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dismissal is done or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad, it's decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"average television, 22 minutes, which can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results will be created. this is not because a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the most reputed companies are sometimes wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009 Google announced that through data analysis outbreaks of flu, the terrible kind, can be predicted -- through data analysis of the Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully well and was a big message sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked perfectly well, year round year until it suddenly wasn't working,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it just didn't work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data most reputed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all of these errors, data have accumulated in decisions of life -- on the workplace, in case of legal action, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">"so, we should be sure to ensure that data is helpful."</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know lots of trouble with data. I work in computer-assisted genetics -- an area where some smart people unthinkable many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years I have detected some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"you have to solve a complex problem, do mainly two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"as the first, you place this problem in its parts, so that you can analyze the items; as Zones you put the items together again to summarise a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: taking apart and put together."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help a problem or understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to add the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all possess it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"when there is something in which the brain is good, it's parts and pieces to get together again, even if the information is incomplete, to then put a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"that's why I believe it was Netflix so successful because they have used data and minds, where they are also in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience what they otherwise wouldn't have been capable of. but the decision, how to take all these parts, and make it a show like" House of Cards "which was not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show that meant she entered a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all of their decisions, first when they chose TV ideas, then they chose" "Alpha House" "as show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision, because they could always say:" "they say to us the dates."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe that things go wrong when data begin to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and not to forget it, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" Magic 8 Ball ". it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question, you just need to shake the ball to get an answer." most likely "-- right here at this moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"later, I will carry out it with a Technikdemolition."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"I have made some decisions in my life so far, whereby I should have heard on the ball in retrospect."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know of course, when you have the data available, you would like to replace them through something much clandescent, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"maybe the ball will be wiser and wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"I think this as a very encouraging message, that despite the large amount of data still pays off to make decisions to be an expert in what one is doing, and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks that you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
