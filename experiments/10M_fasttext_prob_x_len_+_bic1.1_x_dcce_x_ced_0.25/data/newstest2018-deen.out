Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards to change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt where youth should meet today .
a pit chapel where now is buried for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the one @-@ scale reason of farmers .
the oldest official card of Munich promotes exciting stories to days .
it is annoying if land cards are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
&quot; that knows everyone who had to look at this time , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i took place instead of a circum@@ ference road a green meadow . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria atom , an offer of the Pf@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but topical - but it is very enligh@@ tening . &quot;
especially when comparing them with current online maps .
then it is clear how cities and municipalities are changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich &apos;s area of Munich since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work of pat@@ ch@@ work which one cannot recognise as such .
&quot; in the large coverage map , for cities and communities , detailed maps , so @-@ called pri@@ mal blades , were incorporated . &quot;
this ar@@ isen according to the Bay@@ er@@ ischer surve@@ ying administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and ski@@ pping the first measurement of Bay@@ er@@ ers .
your Client : Napoleon .
the French He@@ er@@ es@@ hi@@ jack@@ ers occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second World War Cri@@ mean War with Austria .
Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and gave an top@@ ographical survey of Bay@@ erns - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops went up with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 , the present neighbors , which created the idea of a nationwide Bayern @-@ card . &quot;
&quot; max IV . Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische surve@@ ying Administration . &quot;
the Ur@@ posi@@ tional Journal of Munich dates back to the year 18@@ 56 and is like all the other to be found on the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Landes@@ library .
the comparison morning / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; one example of this is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears in the map of 18@@ 56 still relatively isolated . &quot;
&quot; Send@@ ling was built 21 years after the map , thus 1877 , as a Munich city . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings focus around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the Bav@@ arian peasants against Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : in the first glance , a small percentage appears with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ writing numbered Fl@@ ur@@ pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; jungle &quot; &quot; which was derived from the basic tax . &quot;
&quot; even today , small plots do not occupy farmers more - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot; &quot;
a large green area is characterised north of under@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 locations of the October Revolution , was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert . &quot;
on the other side of Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; in the case of the present district of today A@@ u @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen is not only read the street name &quot; &quot; At the Gast@@ sta@@ g &quot; &quot; or from the ascent &quot; On the air , &quot; but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ strasse , you were once called people with madness . &quot;
there was founded in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Mün@@ chner circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ aissance &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ isons . &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard led the establishment of the establishment of King Ludwig &apos;s wife in connection with the death of King Ludwig &apos;s II . &quot;
&quot; he was advanced for his time and for example , ended the chains of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he forbidden the staff to use violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen who has engaged himself for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients was first place , later on 500 seats were extended . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity is no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the gy@@ ear@@ nest in hair 1905 . &quot;
&quot; there have been the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ East , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ r@@ atri@@ ots in Germany . &quot;
&quot; at the area of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt , young people now meet young people in Munich &apos;s Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um . &quot;
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and walked in a youth @-@ house with training establishments .
&quot; located west is the football field of TS@@ V Munich East , east residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 the children of the house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; &quot; was founded in architectural attack on the origin of the Irish Republic , who had been destroyed during the Second World War by bombing . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed around 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; main square &quot; , &quot; the department was named &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change to the Second World War in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Al@@ lies were split in December 1944 a lot of holes in the city center .
a big remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
&quot; the English institute , small business houses and a pit chapel from the Middle Ages were once stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where the first @-@ breaking ceremony took place on April 5 , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; with the sli@@ ders , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial photograph of today - and filling the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof . &quot;
civil Rights group published travel@@ er for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Union for the promotion of coloured co@@ ats has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i because of the discrimin@@ atory policy and the rac@@ ist attacks of the state to Mis@@ sour@@ i .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Board for the federal state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which should come into force up to 28 August 2017 , call for special attention to visitors , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i , as a number of un@@ questionable , racial or @-@ based incidents throughout the country , and here it is noted , &quot; says it in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law by Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder to win dis@@ crimin@@ ality , as well as the prosecution bodies of the State , dis@@ proportionate to minorities , prompted the group to give the travel warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said . &quot;
&quot; they have violations of civil rights , people happen . &quot;
&quot; they are hal@@ ted because of their skin colour , they are put together or killed , &quot; &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear cases in such a frequency that we have not heard yet .
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the USA .
&quot; the group quoted incidents like rac@@ ist pro@@ go against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died in fragile circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no gasoline any longer during the journey by the state and was taken prisoner by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without having accused of any crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also pointed out a recent report by the office of the general state office of Mis@@ sour@@ i , in which it is shown that black drivers in the state are 75 per cent more common than wh@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of and their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people must be willing to bring it Cau@@ tion or let your relatives know that they travel through the state .
Mis@@ sour@@ i promised a 100 hate crime in 2015 according to the latest figures from hate @-@ hate reporting program of the F@@ BI in relation to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country .
&quot; the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it more difficult to complain a company because of housing or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil liberties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had published travel arrangements for Texas and Arizona , after the states had to ple@@ dge to prohi@@ bi@@ ous people because of immigration violations , which according to the AC@@ L@@ U will contribute to further re@@ pro@@ vocation . &quot;
&quot; travel arrangements are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but in recent times , stakeholders have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
aun@@ ching project is elementary
the fisher@@ man Wei@@ de@@ ench@@ n project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Bundestag Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have drawn a picture on site .
&quot; at the rec@@ ap@@ hor@@ st of the Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the fisher@@ bacher CD@@ U village met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs . &quot;
&quot; Markus Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann granted first insights into his operations , in which he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows , and also many young animals and housed in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Black milk &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative mark@@ eter for the milk of his cows , so Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este is exclusively a region@@ ally .
&quot; as he is also called BL@@ H@@ V @-@ president of Fis@@ her@@ bach , he designated the &quot; &quot; elementary project &quot; . &quot; &quot;
I can not profit@@ ably farm on such steep areas .
&quot; the green space for a lot of work , a lot of time must be edited using the motor sense . &quot;
&quot; we have been here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; stressed Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the el@@ eventh plant and generated this without any chemical plant protection and fer@@ til@@ isers , even if there is no bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider , the Comm@@ une was clear : &quot; &quot; the Comm@@ une has recognised the importance of the Wei@@ ght project and is pleased with the Leader . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hect@@ are , farmers had to be supported . &quot;
I hope that the re@@ for@@ estation of the areas could have been drawn up for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure that we have , are the people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how they continue their operation , &quot; &quot; stressed the Mayor . &quot;
farmers are often in criticism because of funding
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the disclosure area amounts to 40 hectares which can not be split up to at least 20@@ 23 .
&quot; of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of its leaders was promoted , a quarter carried by the municipality of fisher@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the farmers love 12 6@@ 10 euro , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of Wei@@ de@@ ench@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the life of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and the house@@ wives it does not go . &quot;
&quot; also for Peter Weiss stood firm : &quot; &quot; here , best food is produced . &quot;
the Land@@ scap@@ ego@@ ism ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ de@@ f@@ ences .
the goal is the disclosure of the Schwar@@ zw@@ alds .
prerequisite is the presence of one of the L@@ PR signed conve@@ y@@ ms .
&quot; in addition , the tough surface should not be worse ( H@@ ang@@ incl@@ ine over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by for@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the fisher@@ man Wei@@ ght project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build just 16 kilometers fence . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares , the Calabri@@ an costs are more than 112 000 Euro . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now is the White House of Tr@@ ump the Statue of Liberty
the safest sign of a regime Tran@@ sition is when they start to push the statues .
&quot; the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ m Square in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tr@@ ump @-@ regime , knew certainly what he did , when he accepted a symbolic A@@ xt in a h@@ it@@ ful dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N on the proposals of President of the dras@@ tic restriction on legal migration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to remain fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of jet@@ ties and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ators would have tried it out if he had done it .
&quot; but he laid hold of their significance , and in particular the meaning that you were attributed to , when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after completion of the monument , was added to its base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller Ab@@ co@@ sta : &quot; I want to go here not to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illum@@ ines the world . &quot;
the poem which you relate to which later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is fac@@ tu@@ ally correct , but as he formed it ourselves , it is not really about story . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; your poor , your poor , / Your pressing masses , who would like to breathe free , / the el@@ ding waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; there has never been a time , in which the &quot; &quot; miserable waste &quot; &quot; was better to see on our screens . &quot;
Miller was not committed to literary critic - he clearly did that those people in Tr@@ umps are not welcome .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute : it is indeed a conflict of the importance of America .
&quot; Lazarus and their friends , who put themselves in place to place their words after their death on the base , knew very well that they have accomplished a highly political act . &quot;
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Re@@ public@@ anism by representing the feminine portra@@ yal of freedom in a ab@@ used classical exposition .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice .
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist Cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just like Lazarus changed the importance of the statue , the people of the right wing wanted to switch it back for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the big cry , Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued that the Statue of Liberty was not to invite , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative , who brings the American Fl@@ ame into the converted world : &quot; lady Liberty is proceeding . &quot;
it is intended to carry the F@@ ack@@ el of Liberty from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not be enligh@@ tened by the road to the United States .
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here towards something .
the meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of point of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus ins@@ isted in seeing it as they were seen from the exhausted , miserable , yet hope@@ ful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships . &quot;
&quot; it is about the true sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people , seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they have to hear .
&quot; and that is of course not the perspective , the Miller and Tr@@ ump will ever recognise . &quot;
&quot; your tor@@ ch should not light the way , but the hatred , which is its only source of power . &quot;
world Championships 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle remembers a time when only two ch@@ ins belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; the service director of the Lei@@ ch@@ ant@@ th@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ of @-@ member cont@@ ingent in the world team will contribute to a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 that will start on Friday .
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; in Scotland develops special things &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will guide it until we find it out , &quot; said Black . &quot;
I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals cont@@ enders , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - that can compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was elected by the team to team capacities . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is quite modest .
&quot; their captain &apos;s speech was amazing , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were ch@@ ot@@ ted or where they live or train , went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ ie brought quite naturally , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Commonwealth of Silver med@@ all@@ ists who compete in their fifth World Championship in the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; is that 16 fo@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s most total number of athletes during the world championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the year , the middle @-@ wing@@ ed mu@@ ir leads to five British and two European records last year . &quot;
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rounds . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m runs , is another shot that is included in the British team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle remembers their first World Championship as the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell was .
&quot; the Mann@@ it@@ ts capit@@ än@@ in says that they are &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots belong not only to the team , but in some cases also with the medals and at the Fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; what is special about this team captain , is in fact that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chose to make it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all those who belong to the team . &quot;
it shows only how far we came .
&quot; they are here to be established athletes , athletes , who want to rise to Po@@ dies . &quot;
what my speech is concerned as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think it went well . &quot;
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
&quot; so it is really important to put on this HE@@ D support , and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion . &quot;
&quot; I get a second chance to go there down and compete , and it &apos;ll just be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
&quot; blocking critic on Facebook : keep yourself not a public office , if you cannot wear the hal@@ ves of voters . &quot;
the father of our land knew something of bad media .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long before the newspapers struck him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he mel@@ lowed the criticism , certainly . &quot;
but he did not have his critics sil@@ enced .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; the freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we will lead to the sheep of the battles . &quot;
&quot; that brings me to Maryland about Governor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who must work to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on its official Facebook page .
and the American Civil War refused this week since the beginning of this week .
&quot; the st@@ ab of the Govern@@ ors dis@@ missed the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ ley , and the online comment was full of a recipro@@ cal reaction with &quot; &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it is just Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important if it is a type such as Ho@@ gan .
this is a Republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing .
it has the two @-@ highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
ho@@ gan@@ ese is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles .
he was also very a@@ dep@@ t at making Facebook as the primary means to connect with his constitu@@ ents and deb@@ ating his ha@@ un@@ eless head after chemotherapy in his side .
&quot; therefore , the blocking of individuals who come to the Board of Govern@@ ors , which is a public forum , which is officially designated as officially , and by employees who are to be paid by public tax dollars - need@@ less and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
in an interview with The Washington Post Bu@@ gans Spre@@ cher@@ in Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the actions of the Govern@@ ors and argued that the comments of the comments is nothing more than a moderation .
but it &apos;s too easy to use the image of tro@@ lls or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ asser@@ tive people who vibr@@ ate the whi@@ p online .
the post talked to some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
&quot; and these are just real people , who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a pastor , no tro@@ lls . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful , and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the pastor took the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ ose Catholic Faith .
&quot; Law@@ y@@ tin Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ asser@@ tive , but she asked for hate crime . &quot;
&quot; I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate speech and gave other latest news , she wrote in the commentary in the commentary news &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t even appreciate this idea if a number of people are on the same issue , then it is used by some rather than a so @-@ called collective action and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the staff of the Govern@@ ors expressed as &quot; &quot; concentrated &quot; &quot; spam attack , others would probably call &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocked a critic or a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in former times when you had done the same that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical guidance , to burn or burn prot@@ esters and to silence . &quot;
but that just happened just digital .
&quot; Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critici@@ ze it , that he has imp@@ lied Facebook and other social media . &quot;
President Tr@@ ump is dis@@ missed by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed .
one of the first milestones in this question fell in Virginia last week .
&quot; the chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County is the first A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Apostle James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they called a voters from their Facebook page . &quot;
and in K@@ entu@@ cky Governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington &apos;s time , Washington had a similar impact as the internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lies between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous mailbox stroke at its leadership . &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous tro@@ lls .
&quot; the people used pseudon@@ y@@ me such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all letters of newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions , who critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and navigation with Britain , master@@ ed his ministry , according to the historical documents that were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not have her sil@@ enced .
&quot; freedom of expression , dis@@ agreement of dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation . &quot;
and true guidance means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
the former Europeans n ° 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for the next three days in local comfort since the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an organized the 25th edition of the Scottish senior Open .
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , which took part in the Ar@@ cher@@ field links last year , before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new au@@ ger scene and acts as a tournament message in the name of the club and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he achieved his glory with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from his best , he is in a great condition . &quot;
Jerry made a great job when he placed this place .
he is a eager pro@@ pon@@ ent of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ men are looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , even though he won in his 32 @-@ year career both in the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; that really feels particularly , &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I have not able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open as they had won in the year , after I had won them out of the program . &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year , returns to the campaign on the home floor . &quot;
this event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen asset management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you feel that additional pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; I am happy , as far as I have gone . &quot;
&quot; with the trio in the field , the former Masters @-@ winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ feld . &quot;
&quot; Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce are among the six islands in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ All@@ ister , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; entrance is free , the car park costs £ 5 a car with a passengers and £ 10 per car with two or more in@@ mates . &quot;
all proceeds are taken to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
fewer lung cancer by pas@@ si@@ ly smoke
fewer people have died in the last two decades due to passive exposure to lung cancer .
&quot; to this result , scientists from the University of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) come into a study . &quot;
&quot; according to our estimates are due to 16@@ 7 lung cancer cases on passive smoke , &quot; said Mr. Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he had a own study on this subject from 1994 . &quot;
back then there were still 400 lung cancer incidents because of pas@@ si@@ rau@@ ts per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
domestic degrees prove to be very complex
&quot; construction work in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &apos; lie less in time , &quot; &quot; says the head of the Bau@@ ma Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of domestic closures , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as in the underground much se@@ amounts , which is not noticed in the plans . &quot;
&quot; the traffic , which hin@@ ders again the construction work , represents a big problem for the construction tr@@ up@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of the drivers before red lights and dra@@ gs is already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is locked and only the buses are entitled to pass .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p are busy working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; the hot days were already very beautiful .
&quot; fortunately we were looked after by our friend Fritz Matt with bold mineral water , &quot; &quot; says Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i cook the dinner they do not use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai District , in the un@@ quiet Indones@@ ian province Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife normally places a sweet potato - locally as &quot; &quot; not@@ a &quot; &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour the star@@ chy tu@@ ber will be taken and swal@@ lowed and swal@@ lowed up , un@@ washed hands . &quot;
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay - it has no furniture - where it also performs its daily work ( e.g. dresses with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp ) .
a bu@@ cket in a roof@@ ed room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of their man , they have not been assigned any fields . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is usual here .
&quot; of course , late to work can be dangerous : most of the village men are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to get around at 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was admitted in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , to vote only 1,0@@ 26 elders by a public lifting system in front of the occupation forces . &quot;
an existing movement that stir@@ s up for independence against Dutch domination turned swift against the government of Jak@@ arta involving control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observing .
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea and the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is ö@@ de . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Carolina to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .
there are no public transportation .
&quot; the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ boo poles , and from shaft roofs that were converted by r@@ ust into different yellow @-@ brown tones . &quot;
&quot; very few In@@ don@@ esi@@ ans have done their journey here , because journalists and practically no foreig@@ ner . &quot;
before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans a God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not accustomed to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to its lively , handmade tur@@ ban , their dark shirt and her bright rock . &quot;
&quot; earlier , we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is In@@ don@@ esi@@ ght For@@ gotten province where 28 % of the people live below the poverty line and some of the worst im@@ mortality and alphabe@@ tis@@ ation rates in Asia .
but it is also In@@ don@@ esi@@ ght Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine of the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land provincial in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , Free@@ port was built in value of 3,@@ 1 billion US dollars of gold and copper . &quot;
Pap@@ ua has a value of estimated 78 billion US dollars worth the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars .
&quot; however , these riches are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , who ensure that in @-@ use the military has preserved a profound presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port local military operations and units between 1998 and 2004 paid nearly 20 million US dollars , including up to 150@@ ,000 USD to one officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ lian demands for greater autonomy threaten this Golden G@@ ans and are treated gn@@ it@@ less .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indones@@ ian military . &quot;
Mass@@ ages in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal groups in the 1970 @-@ 1990s were held in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indones@@ ian police were more than 3.@@ 900 peaceful demonstrators last year . &quot;
&quot; we &quot; &quot; lose all &quot; &quot; in a report by the Arch@@ diocese Bris@@ bane taken from year 2016 , in which reports on atrocities of the previous year are , such as un@@ lawful exec@@ utions and torture , rape and electrical attacks are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal rainf@@ all of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as each week happened , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
the screws are reinforced because Pap@@ u@@ as resources produce a influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing , as Muslim economic migrants come from the populated islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ting cant@@ ons sell @-@ rats Chi@@ cken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut . &quot;
local people fight to stay here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables at the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ local , which went to work in the provincial capital Nor@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
it has the native Pap@@ ua - the m@@ ama @-@ m@@ um &#91; the women &#93; from Pap@@ ua - their market .
&quot; the Indones@@ ian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , said to tackle inequalities and the legal violations in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign . &quot;
the former Zimmermann was 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little and today the locals feel betrayed .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expectation of fulfilling our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a deep point just two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas song from a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indones@@ ian soldiers took on a motorcycle by the darkness . &quot;
the ro@@ cking kids told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took off their tone , and later came back with four soldiers , according to the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , and smote the group with their armed forces , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard pressed , that he fell into a coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government Commission was put in fire and escal@@ ated things next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered together on a football ground in front of the local police station and the military commander @-@ centre to seek justice . &quot;
they bore cerem@@ onial hun@@ ts and led the Li@@ ita dance - in the circle continuously and a bird @-@ tail im@@ it@@ ating - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some prot@@ esters began to drag stones at the police and military post .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not shared by the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ emi@@ as Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the im@@ min@@ ent danger and called to rest and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was able to listen to the mood .
&quot; when I turned , I suddenly shot in my left hand wr@@ ist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colourful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still does not know who has been fired , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the soldiers assembled here . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was taken three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran into it and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who bears just one name , the TI@@ ME in gri@@ mmer mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed it .
&quot; the editor of the Pap@@ ua @-@ police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said re@@ porters , that his officers wanted to &quot; &quot; secure their station &quot; &quot; because they will be attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; said the speaker of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstrators were killed and many more injured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings arrived only on the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i was a passionate talk in Com@@ ap@@ ura , in which he vo@@ iced sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and s@@ wor@@ e to address the historic abnorm@@ alities in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so it will no longer happen in the future . &quot;
&quot; safety Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 , that he establishes a court mechanism for sett@@ ling historic human rights violations . &quot;
but the out@@ talk began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 @-@ s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ er years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that need to be passed through , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then Wir@@ anto had a retreat , when he spoke with TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta , and said , he did not set any plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is governed by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; accused , accused the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; said more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ ors &apos;s bloody independence from 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua were already put together , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such claims with gri@@ mm@@ ed un@@ believer .
&quot; I was interviewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; Y@@ oh@@ anes , &quot;
&quot; I am we@@ ary . &quot;
he says that he is still alive for years later in fear .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have been afraid of being arrested by the military , I fear being shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten up by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought to me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday sho@@ oss the Indones@@ ian police on villagers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between the villagers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to bring a unconscious man into the hospital died a person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dro@@ wned while he died in a nearby river died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
triumph@@ ed villagers prot@@ ested before the site office .
&quot; the police said that the villagers dump@@ ed stones on officers , who re@@ acted to them by fire @-@ nuts . &quot;
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot the amount and a fatal .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i who lived near the hospital and witness how the injured has been delivered here quickly , so the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I have hidden me two days in my house . &quot;
the di@@ ke @-@ Parliament called to hold the officers to account and withdraw the mobile Brig@@ ade of the Police in the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai has always been an un@@ ru@@ gged d for the Indones@@ ian government .
&quot; the lack of sensual development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribal community , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army , which claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua , by putting spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indones@@ ian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ den@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to that , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years and taken arbitrary , under the pretext of &quot; safeguarding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty is strengthening the dissatisfaction .
&quot; the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just as out of range .
the people here are building everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and vegetables and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women to be able to edit four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain most of the crops for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a tasted only 10,000 Indones@@ ian R@@ up@@ ies ( 75 C@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic inequalities between the local Pap@@ ua and the new immigrants grew , who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire Airport . &quot;
&quot; the few jobs , which exist in the region generally go to the better trained and aff@@ lu@@ ent migrants . &quot;
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skill to compete for their own companies .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Chief Executive Board of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions to the coverage of international media remain tense . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and basi@@ lle Long@@ cham@@ p were de@@ ported because of poor co @-@ ordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although their rare permission was given to films . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is electoral campaign , the limitations of reporting to take up transparency and development , not realised . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to try to report of in@@ th@@ esi@@ ally eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua : visa @-@ denial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in the lack of press control , the international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in March , six Pacific states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Sal@@ om@@ onen Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically been supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indones@@ ian foreign minister Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r had pointed out the pro@@ aches of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there is free media so that it is difficult to conce@@ al the evidence of human rights . &quot;
people on site want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right ambassador , Ke@@ es Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura gave her silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source which also attended the meeting but wants to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has a further presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua say they will probably not vote again for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sha@@ ders , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Chief Executive Board . &quot;
&quot; he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that , is living under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in impover@@ ished education and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ i said that the Pan@@ i@@ ai folks , like other Pap@@ ua , have to consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; debt &quot; that he has to pay . &quot;
&quot; they do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and intimi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sh@@ uss@@ sion led a last symbolic act of Des@@ p@@ ite : the cor@@ pse of a victim has been buried just across the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they might never come to justice , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with sal@@ ted head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; skyscr@@ aper of Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest dormit@@ ories of the world in Dubai , and forced hundreds of inhabitants , of the 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ story buildings . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that is swe@@ pt in just two years by the plateau , which is called the Tor@@ ch @-@ Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept with fire and we stood at the fire of fire , and at the cry of the people . &quot;
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; &quot; told a inhabitants who lived his name as George An@@ ab , Re@@ uters . &quot;
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 hours GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building disman@@ tled .
&quot; the government said , they work on the provision of accommodations for those affected . &quot;
&quot; the incident can be rev@@ ital@@ ise questions on the safety of materials , which are used in outer areas of skyscrapers around the world . &quot;
&quot; a study by the management of the Tor@@ ch @-@ building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest portion of the damage came from the clothing , the outside cover to decoration or isolation . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police , they believe that the system of plates to isolate and cl@@ adding at the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a Bran@@ ch in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : continued Best of @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis association ( IT@@ F ) was signed with his great Davis Cup cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
&quot; during the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the Davis Cup single @-@ cup was supported to play only on two winners , Hau@@ ch@@ af@@ er is not supported by the necessary two @-@ thirds majority . &quot;
&quot; although it is often very long , but even so highly valued five @-@ set classics remain the traditional value . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member countries voted for the reform , the aim of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only slightly mis@@ understood . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; Hag@@ g@@ ty said . &quot;
I will continue to work on improving the application .
&quot; not only in the vote was , according to many contradictions , the proposal had come to make the final in a neutral place . &quot;
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : so the fin@@ alists will have the host right at the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the next round in the first round .
&quot; to reduce the costs of the promot@@ ers , the requirements for training courses etc. are facilitated and the players will need to have less official media appointments before the Davis Cup . &quot;
more than 1 out of 5 U.S. travelers does not bring bot@@ any objects to the aircraft .
&quot; a survey conducted by plane passengers yiel@@ ded that more than 20 per cent of consciously or unconscious items passed to the control points of the U.S. Security Administration Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , which took the aircraft , while remaining accidentally pro@@ cured knife or other items with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 per cent claimed , they could have delayed that they mistak@@ enly have traveled with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explosive . &quot;
&quot; the survey conducted at more than 1,000 people - which was conducted by a jet charter service , Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also noted that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ quired , the en@@ cor@@ es that they kno@@ w@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were . &quot;
&quot; the most common objects , which were used at T@@ SA agents , were food and liquids . &quot;
&quot; more than 3 percent said to have been kno@@ w@@ ingly worn items with blade by the security control , whereas 2,@@ 2 per cent of the female respondents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respondents also confirmed that they had visi@@ bly banned drug in the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; the company said , it has interviewed travelers in the whole country to find out how many accidentally smu@@ g@@ gling were brought with the airport security and how many it had been deliberately done . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s no surprise that the people who are most likely smu@@ g@@ gling - kno@@ w@@ ingly or un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly - by security , those were those most often fly . &quot;
&quot; however , the company indicates that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing . &quot;
people are often uncertain how liquids they are allowed to take them or how much of it .
so it &apos;s no surprise that the largest amount of the T@@ SA conf@@ is@@ cated items out of the T@@ SA .
&quot; for a time the people thought , the T@@ SA could view books as smu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware . &quot;
&quot; liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k is it no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customer canc@@ eled order
&quot; with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 &quot; , I would like to have a huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he has to suggest that a portion of the customer has re@@ with@@ drew their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the always triumph@@ s numbers of revenue growth and even gigantic sales destinations , Tes@@ la leader El@@ on Mus@@ k has revealed a different , less gl@@ it@@ ous figure for the first time : that of the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k has often applied for the new car with more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ k Mus@@ k : from a total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre@@ orders have already been withdrawn since 6@@ 3,000 . &quot;
critics had always pointed out that this is only a non @-@ binding reservation .
&quot; for canc@@ el@@ ation Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; reservation payment &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; currently , 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations required before , space Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts at present . &quot;
&quot; however , that cancellation of up to around 12 percent of all orders could become a problem , however the Tes@@ la boss does not believe . &quot;
&quot; its argument : the challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production site . &quot;
in the past year Tes@@ la had supplied 8@@ 4.000 vehicles .
&quot; in 2018 , all models should be taken together - 500,000 , 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , we are approaching a day of 1800 reservations . &quot;
&quot; who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; is allowed to count on delivery today at the second half of 2018 with the delivery - if Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand new , never in practice , without much inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum relief . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; however , it comes too much delays , then the dis@@ binding nature of reservations may become the problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then the company cannot prevent un@@ satisfied customers , run away in dro@@ ves . &quot;
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt with@@ draws the rules of the Obama Era to cut emissions back
&quot; one day after he had been compl@@ ained by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , made his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era , to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ driven air pollution . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change as his agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities towards more quickly than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint against his previous position in a federal government .
&quot; it is a deadline for a deadline , which ran on 1 October for States to adhere to the standards for bottom @-@ related o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; pro@@ clamation announced in June that he will delay the compliance with a year to give his authority more time , to study the Plan and avoid &quot; hin@@ der &quot; in local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was appointed President Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ General of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma before his appointment was a reliable , reliable , effective environmental protection regulations . &quot;
&quot; since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has been repeated repeatedly to block rules or delay , which resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden conversion from Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ ding regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Justice in Washington decided that the EPA @-@ administration has exceeded his authority as he tried to undertake the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies for monitoring and reducing methane . &quot;
&quot; in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his about @-@ face at Oz@@ on@@ standards is simply the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfilling of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; among earlier administr@@ ations , the EPA has often been charged the deadlines for carrying out and then waited to establish an appointment for implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt said the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by judicial proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also take the law and authority , which gives us , seriously . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA that P@@ ru@@ itt sometime may use his &quot; authority to delay and all the other legally available authority , &quot; to make sure the rules are based on solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Republi@@ can in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive reform of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill introduced last month was to delay the implementation of the rules by 2015 for at least eight years .

Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the church , the old cemetery @-@ area is invited to the old cemetery @-@ area in tum@@ our on Sunday , 16 July , at 16.@@ 30 pm . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historical St. Hil@@ arius system , a popular place to stay . &quot;
the visitors of the sixth benefit seren@@ ade can ench@@ ant themselves from this powerful place .
the saving and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters of tum@@ ors to their concern .
Walter Martin@@ i stressed : &quot; it is a unique tourist village . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was mentioned for the first time in the Württemberg &apos;s premi@@ er book : Graf Hermann of Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the present parish church to tum@@ our , and the Vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; at Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and to his brother Diet@@ rich for 20 Mark Silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the wording of the certificate , on the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the one @-@ old parish church also a splendid court , to which the church or the pat@@ ron@@ age belong to it and not the other way round . &quot;
so there are also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Upper Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , it was beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf that are still visible today in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the glorious settlement of the village . &quot;
old maps from the time around the year 1600 under@@ pin these historical conditions .
the pat@@ ron@@ age quite originated from the early medieval town of Law .
&quot; a Lord , who built a church , re@@ acted and occupied with a pastor , remains owner of this church and could also for@@ er@@ ve this own church . &quot;
associated with it was the right to use a pastor or the Bishop a new pastor .
three alt@@ ars were there in the church and two bells on the tower .
the biggest of the two de@@ bar@@ st at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created Glo@@ cke was then for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later to be handed over to the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window plates were mat@@ ured and the clock parts were stolen .
the roof was un@@ tight .
in 17@@ 96 French troops in the vicinity of the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church wheel@@ chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threatened in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hel@@ o cemetery was also served as the last resting place for the dead from listening .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ church has been abandoned .
only the Kir@@ j@@ ur@@ m had to be stopped .
&quot; in the New Year , 18@@ 34 , a storm ra@@ ined the Kir@@ cht@@ ur@@ m and the half cras@@ hed . &quot;
&quot; to prevent un@@ happiness , the tower was abandoned . &quot;
only the current tower existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750 year old church history .
today Horst K@@ all@@ en@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em by the &quot; creative profitability &quot; as successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn the Hil@@ arius system .

the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organis@@ ers are hoping for many supporters about the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius system which is of importance for tum@@ ours and listening welding .
the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ gens are particularly committed to the home care of such as seren@@ ade @-@ organizer Walter Martin@@ i .
society wants to test the approval of Win@@ dr@@ yers
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim supports &quot; &quot; no legal condition for the construction and therefore has turned to the country . &quot;
&quot; the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; has called &quot; &quot; Andreas Co@@ ke ( CD@@ U ) &quot; &quot; to withdraw its approval for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal .
the association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved since at that time in four halls only at the border to swal@@ lows a wind power concentrations .
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are fundamentally possible , at the same time , the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind power for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones should prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; although the city Vier@@ sen had decided on a few days before a change in the area of space used , a second wind power zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - which however had not approved the district government Düsseldorf , because of a formula . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning the legal condition , the shared author@@ is@@ ance is still un@@ lawful and therefore decreasing , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : the City Council decided once again decided prior to the summer break @-@ off zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; kens : &quot; in this point , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines are excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the request .
&quot; the corresponding writing has been received last week by the circle Vier@@ sen , &quot; explained a speaker . &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion of check the matter again .
but they are likely to perform that the procedure is stopped .
&quot; with a view of the ongoing proceedings at the Board of Directors , the circle was not intended to express itself in content with the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NE@@ W Re , a subsidiary of the NE@@ W , is planning the construction of four to 200 meters high on the bo@@ ish@@ list . &quot;
&quot; already last year , the company had participated in which the city was attended by Vier@@ sen , P@@ ei@@ ver@@ ings with the owner of about 65 hectares of great terrain . &quot;
&quot; with the establishment of four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be covered - this corresponds to approximately one fifth of the electricity needs of all four households . &quot;
the NE@@ W Re wants to invest around 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vier@@ sens represented green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , and a stake in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg . &quot;

&quot; in addition , customer potentials are to be re@@ developed again or again . &quot;

but also many natives could have lost the city center when shopping out of the sight .
&quot; in the end all would have to contribute to revi@@ ve the city centre - up to landlords , the factories of the whole city and associations . &quot;
&quot; to overcome with a network the Le@@ th@@ arg@@ y , which began to spread partly , had taken king in spring . &quot;
&quot; Bir@@ git Stre@@ ich , leader of the I@@ HK Centers in Müh@@ l@@ hausen divided into Müh@@ l@@ hausen in the nationwide third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day , for the first time five Thur@@ in@@ gian towns . &quot;

Tr@@ ump made after spot@@ ted trans@@ cription by phone call Mexico under pressure due to payment of the border dam
trans@@ cription by phone calls between U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tr@@ ump called Tr@@ ump in a telephone with the Mexican President Enri@@ que Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to , to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. President ruled him because he had publicly denoun@@ ced the Wall publicly . according to him , he said to him , &quot; &quot; This is what you cannot say to the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern edge of the USA , and sw@@ am to pay Mexico for the project . &quot;
trans@@ cri@@ p@@ te of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and un@@ veiled a tense exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ es that trade for the United States Refu@@ ge@@ es , who emigr@@ ated to Australia , &quot; &quot; mies , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and that the continuance on the trade that was proposed by the government Obama was proposed to ban him like a &quot; de@@ p , &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the USA . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call , after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford @-@ massacre : activists guide rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ akt as a call for justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury was driving through a group of spectators in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and umped to the Ford @-@ Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had reached the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a middle aged man in a needle strip - took a long train at its ci@@ gar and looked after the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; we want this n -- -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; bro@@ t the man . &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; scre@@ ams also rent the silence , as a young black man torn from the passenger seat . &quot;
&quot; fortunately this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is just a post@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; but if then a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost all of the audience showed very real si@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 Citizens of the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night , in the two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey , from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
nobody was charged ever because of the murder .
&quot; it is really invalid that in all these years no one person was arrested - even though we see them in our communities , even though we know who they are , &quot; said T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks , who helps in the organisation of creation . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year former member state member of the State of Georgia and a life @-@ long citizen .
&quot; for him , he serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the mon@@ ro@@ e community that an injustice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want enforcement , we want the end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot reach healing and reconciliation , until we get justice . &quot;
a court physician sets up a beg@@ ining on the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI files , which were obtained from the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding graph@@ ite were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but nobody was ever charged .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects have been on open on foot for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made the black citizen in Georgia for the first time to give her voice a vote in the summer . &quot;
&quot; about the same time as the election according to the F@@ BI of black Far@@ mp@@ ten@@ ant Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a battle down - supposedly because of a woman . &quot;
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ or in the city was that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she carried away from her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to rid Mal@@ com from the prison , so the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; but when she went away from prison and took the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a mo@@ b mo@@ b around the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison which has prepared and arranged the Mor@@ de , &quot; includes a F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a compromise between state and local law enforcement , which was not only involved in murder , evidence and the identity of witnesses covered . &quot;
Broo@@ ks formulated it even more striking .
&quot; it was a electoral law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register yourself and if you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
almost a decade of Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual descendants of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
&quot; her representation is vivid , po@@ ignant and founded in a kind of deep racism that many believe in America it is no longer exists . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to watch , and even harder to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we do not want to talk about the Lyn@@ chen , because we are then confronted with whose hem@@ isp@@ iness in all of us &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or not want to hear what I have done . &quot;
&quot; the samples for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day there was almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest of the Black - into a room and ex@@ iled , as Gre@@ ene gained a well @-@ played survey of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Green@@ es Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of the boss clan for years , but he said , the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so , &quot; Mar@@ bau@@ gh said . &quot;
but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to those times .
&quot; tested the other side of the room tested the actors D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , which play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the t@@ ester sh@@ outs and pus@@ hes it to be angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- He , conce@@ de of my property ! &quot;
r@@ ack@@ er@@ wi@@ es the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs the lau@@ ghing .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ki@@ cking . &quot;
I just don &apos;t think that white people at that time d &apos;@@ n --- &quot; said . &quot;
&quot; but , &quot; funny one of the other black performers . &quot;
&quot; you only have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
&quot; and that is exactly there shifts the energy in the room , a feeling of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie will replace the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy to get this right , not just because of the game , but also because of memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene begins once more .
&quot; this time Ras@@ cona the N @-@ word says , he says it sharp and with prin@@ tou@@ ts . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are cri@@ es , nuts and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , cloth@@ ed with a funeral dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of actors and performs Bil@@ lie Holidays gri@@ eving lob@@ ster &quot; St@@ range fruit . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it there is a group of about four dozen spectators of sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost even@@ ly between black and white .
&quot; a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many come down only the road . &quot;
they all experienced some eight hours of Georgia when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; up to this point , the Mor@@ de have stayed a anec@@ d@@ ote , but now if one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de @-@ runs , the air feels anoin@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the amount to come closer and insp@@ ect the cor@@ pse . &quot;
children squ@@ at on their heads . register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ pering each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ mu@@ cks a little boy , as he wants to remember it . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene would like to thank Gre@@ ene &apos;s crowd - and suddenly it is over .
actors throw the Lyn@@ ch@@ sei@@ l and wi@@ pe out their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w converted Mar@@ bau@@ gh the man in the suit who played the clan .
Nick Ras@@ cona embr@@ aces two of his fellow players and then breaks into their arms crying together , the emotional load of the performance finally breaks with him . &quot;
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ pering one of women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you did it for a reason . &quot;
later the audience gets together with the actors for dinner .
on a table a white pair consists of Atlanta excited about the post@@ ure with a black pair that they have just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ ski fought to find words which has left the performance .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you themselves and who do that , because they look as you , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ n still continues &quot; , &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; today it is called the police @-@ shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks Hof at his table , he e@@ ats and remembers the civil rights . &quot;
he said he already started to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; the retrosp@@ ective is inspiring in a certain way , for it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is like we learn nothing of it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own story , who does not know his own story is do@@ omed to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Arma@@ ge@@ d@@ don &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ re@@ uth
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf sets on a bright fri@@ vol@@ ous staging in front of a gigantic , six @-@ storey setting . &quot;
&quot; the rotation stage ( designed by Aleks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) , op@@ tionally shows a s@@ hab@@ by street corner with a wall @-@ rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; &quot; logo from the GDR &apos;s times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that an open Mercedes @-@ Old@@ timer is a more open Mercedes @-@ classic car , in which the Rhin@@ eland was pos@@ ing as rock @-@ sha@@ kes , or alternatively a is@@ setta . &quot;
&quot; s@@ ap@@ ed oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and greed - that draws itself through its &quot; Ring &quot; staging . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhein@@ h@@ esti@@ cks - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ul@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as in &quot; &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; . &quot; &quot;

the audience thanks it to the ensemble with powerful applause .
&quot; stor@@ my are celebrated Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and Con@@ duc@@ tor Jan@@ owski , who is modest and form@@ ulate his hands for Merkel &apos;s rob@@ bery . &quot;
&quot; great applause are for the festive season , which shows for the first time on stage - in the light of the great heat again in le@@ vel@@ ing leisure clothes . &quot;
&quot; with tension , the appearance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ ete@@ am had been expected . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , he had to leave a hilly pillar concert on himself , there were five years later great glad@@ ness in which the &quot; &quot; bu@@ h &quot; &quot; rep@@ ut@@ ations were under@@ went . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ haus Kath@@ arina Wagner is expected to have a look forward .
&quot; you noticed that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of its view . &quot;
I draw a positive Res@@ um@@ é .
max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in their voluntary year right at several places .
where anywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually in st@@ einf@@ urt , in the furniture shop , once a week I have been here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I already worked in an open full@@ day at school .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it is a nice , wide spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; now they are 26 years , so a late @-@ professional volunteer . &quot;
how does that come ?
quantity : I have taken Ab@@ it@@ ur .
&quot; and then a civil studies , let &apos;s say very successfully . &quot;
&quot; for me , I realized that it is the Fal@@ se for me and I want to do something different , with people working . &quot;
and then I asked what is doing .
&quot; a social year , since there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point maybe also , really is . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I have gathered great impressions .
I will start my studies in social governance in the winter semester .
&quot; I will study dual , do probably in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker education and study in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hoch@@ schule . &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different types of application during the Volun@@ te@@ er Service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it is probably always on where you are going to be FS@@ J .
you can do it from Alter@@ sheim up to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
for me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partly in O@@ GS , so in after@@ care @-@ care . &quot;
for me that was exactly what I got mat@@ ured .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really happened .
unlike in the building studies ?
&quot; quantity : well , here it is not about to reck@@ on st@@ atics . &quot;
&quot; one always has another human being , each one has a very different story behind each other . &quot;
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been caught up out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : I am not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .

Kon@@ vo@@ i Attack of Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in self @-@ orda@@ ined attack
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , one soldiers of Nato and several others hurt . &quot;
&quot; five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter were injured , shared a statement of Nato . &quot;
&quot; confirmed local reports say , according to the incident in the district Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , also three civilians . &quot;
the bombing is the last atro@@ city which has hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday there was a suicide bom@@ bed two people near the Iraqi message in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; in a statement of NATO , the explosion was happened on Thursday evening , when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; impro@@ mp@@ ed explo@@ sives &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all the wounded are in a stable state and be treated in the US military hospital at the Air@@ field Bag@@ ram .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as a so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops at nearby Bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1.@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , including 20 % in the capital . &quot;

&quot; on May 31 , a tremendous bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the deadly militant attack of the country since the U.S. troops pushed away the Taliban from power in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; the violence underlines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , since U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering the number of U.S. troops to support the military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ate in Kab@@ ul has also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies and especially in the call of President As@@ hr@@ af Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA makes a decision to delay the smo@@ g rule after law@@ suits around
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay a regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ aled that the states are obliged to susp@@ end the tu@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place one day after 15 states compl@@ ained because of the step . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; o@@ zone @-@ regulations 2015 , &quot; and said , they show the obligation of the agency to work with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and remember that we react to our state partners , &quot; said EPA chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA to set the o@@ zone @-@ regulations in which in some of the country must be made to determine where inc@@ isions must be made to delay the stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year up to October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 largely democratic states , together with the Colombia district , reached a complaint on Tuesday and said that the action was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to drive a wide range of environmental requirements that the former president Barack Obama has imposed , as part of a broader agenda , which is to boost growth according to Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; however , the efforts have triggered the withdrawal of democrats and reserves , who are worried about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the website of EPA says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the pul@@ p function , and the respiratory symptoms can increase &quot; like as@@ thma . &quot;
community aims
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : in two oppos@@ ites , the council of flu@@ orn @-@ winds is the establishment of a community space in the future seniors . &quot;
&quot; prior to the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing real estate was signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; admittedly , it will still last until the date of the church council is in the municipal ownership , but there is no planning of planning for the project from a private investor to st@@ em@@ ate project . &quot;
there is a discussion regarding a shared space .
&quot; one of the two investors , which are still in the boat , is offered to meet the community . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , it would be a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an extra 70 square meters area is available for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the municipal council are floating above , such a common room , not as a meeting place just for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ ori@@ ent residence , but open to the congregation . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word of &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; made the lap . &quot;
&quot; the decision , which has already been decided by the provision of funds for the current budget already last autumn , by funding opportunities . &quot;
the building is located in the refurb@@ ishment area .
&quot; the establishment of a community space would be , so reports T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; the proposed proposal looks to signal the investor that in this respect , no bil@@ lets between the legs would throw , the conclusion that both saddle - which reduces the infl@@ ating height and the construction of economic power - would be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less , so not only Wil@@ fred Soh@@ mer , be this supplement . &quot;
when &apos;s helps : unanim@@ ous happens he happens to the body .
it is not that easy when the community is common .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many own buildings with which you are not going to be pretty good , but you rest now with the common room from the window , they say , &quot; I am so hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger speaks absolutely for the common area - but absolutely opposed to municipal involvement .
she sees behind it a secret sub@@ Convention to any high level or foreign investors .
&quot; if this is not the case , because with the purchase of the surface we do not give a grant , but get a real , in the case of a doubt , is the contrary . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ner request , pl@@ ored the proposed resolution , takes place three advocates . &quot;
&quot; so in two counter @-@ vote , it remains in the original program that Stefan H@@ all comp@@ lies with : &quot; if we summar@@ ize the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;

hiking in the resin of Stern
in the Har@@ z the first first &quot; star@@ ve ad &quot; is said to arise .
this is planning the association Stern@@ warte Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planetary path in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; Star@@ path &quot; &quot; comes towards the needs of many hard@@ es@@ go@@ ers , named it . &quot;
&quot; he gives nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance . &quot;
the members want to set up along the planned route and inform them about stars and star pictures .
&quot; in the first phase until 2018 , the association is planned &quot; well @-@ reaching installations at five to six places &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; ask St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber . &quot;
the information on the boards will be supple@@ mented by internet .
&quot; therefore , in the selection of the selection of a good mobile network reception , plays a role . &quot;
&quot; also , accessibility is an criterion . &quot;
later the Star@@ path train should be extended by train .
&quot; on the Star@@ path , the viewer knows a lot of knowledge about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; they also learned why stars would have different colors , or why a star is stronger lumin@@ aire than another , even though he is far more distant . &quot;
conve@@ ys also in which star picture is a chosen star and when he is best to see .
the association has been operating in the mountain village of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 which is the highest located observatory in Northern Germany .
the location in the heart of the National Park of Har@@ z is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky way and even the Andro@@ meda - Galaxy with the naked eye clearly visible .
&quot; since 2003 , there has been an initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Gött@@ ingen for something similar to the planned star@@ ry - the planetary path . &quot;
&quot; starting before cervi@@ cal hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary path leads up to the Hain@@ berg and for the observatory - and a &quot; &quot; extrater@@ restrial &quot; &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
&quot; the ri@@ mp@@ s with the individual planet , including the degra@@ ded gra@@ ded plu@@ gs at the end point - are positioned exactly on the distance and the scale of one to two billion . &quot;
&quot; the earth shr@@ unk from a sphere of 6.@@ 5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun is at least 70 cen@@ tim@@ etres from the sun . &quot;
the entire distance of the planetary path is a good 4 kilometers .
&quot; while the light of sun is needed up to the planet of Plu@@ to about eight hours , pedest@@ rians need a good hour to the St@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
pedestrian are thus faster than light in the cosmos .
the march to the next Fi@@ x@@ stern but would last a half year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko meet for the first time to discuss a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who should be at a collision course to staged the most exciting bo@@ xing in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;

after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory through an agre@@ eable decision of the former four @-@ Di@@ visions Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at show@@ time both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .

four final after tire Plat@@ zer
&quot; in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four persons were severely injured in the afternoon on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost before 16.@@ 30 am just before the market launch date , probably after a tire spot control over his vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the passenger s@@ ado@@ wed to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ struck himself and then stayed on the roof in the green@@ way . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured during the accident .
&quot; during the initial supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was locked in direction north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lift pass pass by the accident . &quot;
&quot; Fort@@ un@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; triple @-@ chain works better &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Andre Hoffmann hopes after 2 : 2 to the season op@@ ener against Braunschwei@@ g , that brings the optimization of the dra@@ inage in Au@@ e points . &quot;
&quot; with the first season , Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result too , the two oppos@@ ites would not have been at the 2 : 2 against Braunschwei@@ g . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we have to adjust even better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the defen@@ ders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the tri@@ cycle is also to be optimized further .
and a gate after a h@@ isto@@ ß would not want to fly the Fort@@ ress even more .
&quot; for the future , it will be that no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) will be on the line . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be better assigned to the experiences in preparation with the triple chain , than with the four @-@ dimensional chain . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we are acting in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach of Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is confident about his cause , &quot; because we just have in the three @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; a requirement is , however , that we do not harmon@@ ize and we do not make such a lot of waste . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann is driving to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but whether you cannot speak to a mis@@ er@@ un@@ ted start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we stand on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly speak of a neat season . &quot;
that his coach would not want to know anything .
&quot; until the beginning of the season , I did not judge after six to eight play days , &quot; &quot; Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage against Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken down for a storm . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season virtually with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believes that the players from Au@@ e might be even something fresh because they couldn &apos;t have he@@ avi@@ est and complete play like Fort@@ una against an ascension of the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know as 100 @-@ percentage where they are at present , &quot; says the interior defen@@ ders of the Fort@@ una . &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland have as easy favorite on Sunday in meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; that we put them away , only because we have the claim to come under the first six , is Bl@@ ö@@ d@@ acity , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga to hit by the start , &quot; explains Fort@@ un@@ as Princip@@ al . &quot;
&quot; to make such a statement , arrogan@@ t and over@@ hau@@ ghty . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday on Sunday .
new results published by Swedish asylum @-@ old applicants
&quot; recent results of testing for asylum seekers in Sweden , who have been subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authority for for@@ en@@ sic medicine ( council medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) began with the performance of the tests last year .
&quot; they shall make the assessment of the age more precisely during the asylum process , after the Swedish migration authority ( Migr@@ ations verk@@ et ) critic@@ ised for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees . &quot;
&quot; until today , migrants rose from 6,@@ 8@@ 80 to test@@ able cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency evaluated that the person is &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
tests are carried out only in cases where the person &apos;s age is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson impressed by the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results in the past months are resistant . &quot;
&quot; we do not see a big difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly consistent , &quot; &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases where the person was judged over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers has lied over his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that suggest that the academic person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det published the 5@@ 81 results , she noted that on the 243 of these cases the person had said openly that she will be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of the medical age group , in the x @-@ ray photographs of Wis@@ dom and MR@@ I recordings of knee joints , which then analyzed by dental and radi@@ ologists , was also critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a skep@@ tics is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska @-@ Institute , whose work encompasses the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they left sooner or later than pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
assessing the biological age in this way is very in@@ secure .
&quot; if we cannot say it safely we should not do it as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson impressed by the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , the accuracy of the tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk of assessing a child as an adult is small . &quot;
&quot; the greatest risk lies in when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is approximately 10 percent . &quot;
full in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , seven tons of heavy emphasis was installed at the bridge on the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold L@@ ess , builder manager at the department street and traffic in the government of the government of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work began at the same time on all three san@@ itation bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the building is planned for October and is sure that the schedule is respected .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ ault bo@@ wel bridge from concrete , which is cloth@@ ed with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total @-@ length of 4.@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the other two bridges , she has now arrived in the years . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee the stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished . &quot;
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively , and 10.@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
the bridge at the entrance to Lau@@ ter@@ bach now on the north side of Lau@@ ter@@ bach now has a 1,@@ 30 meter width and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bracel@@ et . &quot;
&quot; this is a water@@ way , which is also used as operations . &quot;
&quot; on the southern part of the bridge , a width of 2,@@ 20 meters should be used on Friday . &quot;
then the pedestrian went away .
&quot; the special thing is that it is about finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented Br@@ ück@@ els .
special finger@@ tips has taken the set of lines through the building plant in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; there is also a glass of glass , which many companies are connected . &quot;
the inhabitants were informed in advance of work by hand notes about the project .
&quot; in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building site and the gathering in direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic @-@ lane . &quot;
&quot; for construction work on the bridge on Lau@@ ter@@ bacher local entrance , the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the cost of the three incub@@ ations are together 700 000 euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ t@@ stone in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : colorful protest in German potato salad
&quot; it does not happen so often that parties move on a strand , but when it comes to an alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , comes together , which is otherwise difficult to put under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ WG , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad coalition that shows on this day peace@@ full flag , because the A@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell is invited to the poster &quot; &quot; large electoral campa@@ igning &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and well @-@ known names to the start brings - like Alice Wei@@ del , who formed together with Alexander Gau@@ land , the prime minister for the federal election on September 24 , and the Vice @-@ president of the Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those , who are in place before the beginning of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ ales , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains color@@ fully . &quot;
&quot; originally the city @-@ picnic was planned under the slogan &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now takes place on the parking lot below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and therefore directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ ales event in the Stad@@ thalle . &quot;
a pretty picture that offers itself here .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , President of the Forums One World and one of the leading organizers , is really pleased : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ ales &quot; , &quot; says the woman who brought him back . &quot;
&quot; the police took many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , presenting its presence especially at the station , which is only a few meters from the venues . &quot;
how is the Af@@ ales come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes told by the Af@@ for@@ get@@ fel zoo who has endeav@@ ored to make such an event and get a supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built @-@ in Laur@@ enti@@ st kir@@ mes there is not enough parking available . &quot;
&quot; well , the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ es is pleased that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
&quot; overlooking the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz he says , &quot; This is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;

&quot; a re hearing with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ aun@@ ists Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is in the series Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 o &apos;clock in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian Tro@@ mp@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea , &quot; or even &quot; Bal@@ can@@ oe &quot; meets classical German training with roots in brass band . &quot;

Kr@@ isten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; but I would like to try everything , &quot; &quot; as Kr@@ isten Ste@@ wart recently opened about their bis@@ ex@@ ual sides . &quot;
&quot; when I get dressed in grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh it was cool , what comes as next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the probably most well @-@ known relationship of the Hol@@ ly@@ rical stars was the one of her &quot; t@@ wilight &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ in@@ son , which was ultimately bitter . &quot;
&quot; despite all that insur@@ es the brood @-@ friendly Dar@@ stell@@ ator compared to the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously fallen in love , which I &apos;ve master@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; or do you think about it , I have played it ? &quot;
after their separation Kr@@ isten gave up that it is bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived the du@@ alism and seriously believed it .
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
I just liked it to be taken seriously .
&quot; especially among them suffered them loud &quot; &quot; Bang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; but in school life than they loved like a bu@@ b : &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really has been hurt .
&quot; when I eleven was told me the kids , I would look like a bug . &quot;
I really felt attacked , scar@@ ed and ashamed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the public does not like to declare their love life : &quot; people expect you to make yourself a certain way and upset me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some call me un@@ grateful , but I don &apos;t like to be able to justify myself to the whole public . &quot;
the governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening at a manifestation with President Tr@@ ump , that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democrats have taken away from me , &quot; said Governor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today , I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thinking ... today , I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you when I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the manifestation broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; as a coach , I would say that it is time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a great announcement in the West Virginia rally .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not award the democratic candidate of Hill@@ ary Clinton . &quot;
Justice that is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state in 2016 .
&quot; For@@ bes notes that he possesses coal min@@ mines in five states , and inherited a coal store by his father . &quot;
it is worth approximately 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday adopted a statement in which it said : &quot; the party change of Governor Justice is another blow to a democratic party which would rather stick to us than to make our country again great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 govern@@ ors and the control of the least legal bodies in history , the announcement of Governor Justice only is the last rejection of a party which is from above to bottom , and unable to find a positive , introduc@@ tory message &quot; , &quot; said R@@ NC @-@ president Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ e pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian interference for D@@ oping sc@@ andal
&quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in the sport . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics chef Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ j@@ tin said at the eve of the athle@@ tics conference on the eve of the athle@@ tics World Championship , that the exile of his country was correct out of the sport and that he is determined to fight the dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; he said , I am sorry for &quot; all the athletes , who were cut away by the gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments at the IA@@ AF Congress for maintaining the ban , which was posted in November 2015 , after a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) references to state @-@ sponsored D@@ oping in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was today a very open answer , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e to the re@@ porters . &quot;
&quot; all the Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized itself in itself , that it has experienced some fairly common times and will do everything possible to make sure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; Co@@ e said he was also &quot; pleased , &quot; that Russia has accepted the criteria for its re @-@ establishment . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot;
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added &quot;
&quot; nine Russian athletes will start at the athle@@ tics World Championship , which begin on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral parties . &quot;
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; threat tests are still inadequate and banned trainer are still free , he said re@@ porters in London following a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
ob@@ itu@@ aries for Mali har@@ med soldiers
at a funeral party in the North @-@ Hes@@ sian Frit@@ z@@ lar approximately 1000 people of the two were supposed to be remembered by a helicopter in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the Dom@@ stadt under high security measures .
&quot; to still un@@ clarified , Secretary of Defense said Secretary of Defense for Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) . &quot;
&quot; she drew the two de@@ pressed pilots , but as &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their professional . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are afraid of this highest sacrifice that they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; she stated . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old staff from Nord@@ h@@ essen came into live on Wednesday a week in the West African Mali .
their offspring were transferred to Germany and was accompanied by a mur@@ der@@ guard of the Bundes@@ wehr at the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Cathedral Saint Peter .
at noon we first took only the relatives in the church farewell .
&quot; after that , the funeral party began in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the German army and politics . &quot;
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
grape @-@ do@@ cks laid down ro@@ ses and the relatives were rich in arm with the ears .
in front of the church Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers watched the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; defense in the Le@@ yen signed the &quot; &quot; Rel@@ ated soldiers &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; and tax @-@ driven . &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann have built the flight operation of the batt@@ ling screw tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger drivers of his regim@@ ent .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , Com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the Reg@@ im@@ ents , to which the soldiers belong , stated : &quot; if this occupation could not turn the crash , it would not have missed . &quot;
doubts about the UN Mission in Mali showed the Minister of the Le@@ yen not : the use is dangerous .
&quot; but it is of high significance for a country , from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; after the funeral , the sack were brought out of the cathedral . &quot;
&quot; when and where they were over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed , the Bundes@@ wehr made no information . &quot;
Prinz Hen@@ rik does not want a tomb next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ es ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , wants to be pun@@ ched after his death by his wife . &quot;
the divided the royal house on Thursday with .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal spa@@ ar is buried in the cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard has already made a sar@@ cop@@ ha@@ g for the two .
&quot; the queen was agreed with the decision of her husband , named it further in the message . &quot;
where prince Hen@@ rik bury he is still unclear .
but he did not have the intent to be buried in his French home country .
Prinz Hen@@ rik never had a drink that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ es in 1972 he would have been king .
&quot; in 2016 , he went into retirement and also sets the title &quot; Prin@@ c@@ esses &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted , he doesn &apos;t see himself compared to his wife - neither after death , L@@ ene Ballet by , the chief of the Danish king &apos;s house . &quot;
where the last resting @-@ day of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will eventually be unclear .
&quot; but he did not have the intention to join in his French home , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the land for which he has worked in the last 50 years .
&quot; Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ ven@@ ance , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
he worked at the Thames in the French Embassy .
&quot; during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people had always been fl@@ atten@@ ed , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy state in his just under 50 years . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did , critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; my dad was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , sil@@ ky , instead of kn@@ it@@ so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Vol@@ vo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco and that in country had the reputation to be the brand of Social @-@ critical intellig@@ ent@@ sia , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .
these were just two errors ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants to take swift re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; due to the loss of red @-@ green governance , Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green government majority for a swift re @-@ election of the agricultural day , but he does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
because he spoke on Friday for the dissolution of the Parliament .
&quot; previously , the surprising ex@@ iting of a Green Liber@@ ation from her country &apos;s delegation in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the Sunday elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hannover lost its scarce A @-@ vote @-@ majority in the Parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the old Green MP El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests founded their first step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election 2018 in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she stated on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
CD@@ U leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend to his faction to record them .
&quot; both CD@@ U and F@@ DP have had 69 seats in the Sax@@ on Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 . &quot;
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new country day will be held regular on the 14th January of the year .
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green national government would now have to decide whether to rule in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l believes it is essential , however , that the state of the country decides as quickly as quickly as possible . &quot;
the CD@@ U group is expected to decide on Tuesday about its action on Tuesday .
&quot; state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ law also provides the possibility of picking up the confidence of the Prime Minister , and choose a replacement . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; our constitution offers multiple options . &quot;
&quot; these opportunities must be legally tested , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; we will discuss all questions in peace , if they are legally tested . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens &apos;s step &quot; but something strange . &quot;
&quot; the leader themselves stressed : &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot;
I feel very well . &quot;
it referred to as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Greens demanded the vote @-@ led members on the return of their country @-@ tag@@ on .
&quot; we assume , of course , that she has received her country @-@ tag@@ on that she has received over the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; shared the Le@@ aders Met@@ a Jan@@ s@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
the Group Leader of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests . &quot;
they deliberately decided to lead no foreign language in the faction .
&quot; even before the background that there were no content differences , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ or Di@@ did@@ at Martin Schulz condemned the Over@@ view of the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on MEP El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to the CD@@ U as betra@@ yal .
&quot; the conduct of former Greens in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the elec@@ torate , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the Bundes@@ chief of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
&quot; it support the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , soon to choose the country &apos;s day anew . &quot;
the Austr@@ ated T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; the policy &apos;s office &quot; &quot; in her final van@@ ity and in her fr@@ ust their personal interests in front of the welfare of the country , &quot; critici@@ zed SPD Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot;
it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony is doing this dirty game and tries to beat out of it political capital .
Nieder@@ sach@@ sens CD@@ U leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend to his members to take El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to the CD@@ U .
&quot; leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw his v@@ ests before , with personality careers , the outcome of the Sunday election in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was the strongest force at that time before the SPD , SPD and Green had a strong majority of one voice in the country . &quot;
&quot; agricultural Minister in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ f@@ tei@@ ers , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany is discussing about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
agricultural Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt . how can the consumer protect themselves from poison@@ ing eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer consumers and to review the eggs in your refrigerator and review the stamp pressure .
&quot; at the consumer protection portal www.@@ food @-@ hop@@ .de , the federal states provide the most recent information on the affected egg @-@ bat@@ ches . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; also , if after all we know , health hazards is practically excluded . &quot;
&quot; now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer , because the central role of the awareness of the Federal Minister has not really been perceived ? &quot;
the food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately switched off , and since the announcement of Germany there is Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and the risk assessment are available to the consumer .
trade has the same as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are traffic @-@ capable and hygien@@ ically safe .
if with eggs of the back @-@ height salary of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is not transfer@@ able .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time not the companies are to blame .
do production companies and consumers sit in the same boat ?
according to the wise knowledge of the production industry there is no immediate fault .
&quot; rather , they must be expected due to mut@@ in@@ ative illegal practices of services with economic damages . &quot;
as always there is too little control in the harvest .
is it only lacking on the personnel or by conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
&quot; these were just the official controls , which have revealed the process . &quot;
&quot; in the truth , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100 percent . &quot;
that is why a consequ@@ ent clarification of such events and the hand@@ over to public pro@@ secut@@ ors in the cases are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have already stressed several times a number of times that I am expecting a complete enlightenment by the responsible authorities . &quot;
is the regular trig@@ gering in food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumer consumers and consumers have the right to only get safe and traffic @-@ based foods .
&quot; if an un@@ approved insec@@ tici@@ de has been used in the food industry , consumer consumers and consumers are rightly outra@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; woven resources are manufacturers , traders and consumers get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ tici@@ des Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food supply animals is unacceptable and must be ended immediately . &quot;
it must be consistent on all levels and have been working with high pressure .
&quot; I expect from all relevant authorities , that the fact is made fast and incomplete . &quot;
how the financial rules of football can affect ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
&quot; the rules , which aim to prevent un@@ settled issues of European foot@@ ball@@ ers , ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s world @-@ record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain did not distur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A , because the leading organisation that monitors the European game has the power , teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair @-@ Play rules , which in 2011 were launched by the UEF@@ A &apos;s UEF@@ A date that PS@@ G point to point out that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar has been financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of ten million dollars per year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make sure the money is easy to make ne@@ ym@@ ar and bring it into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy @-@ rich ruling family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; associations may need much money for the purchase of players , but need to control with legitimate sources , which enable them to make the break @-@ up point in their on the football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Pl@@ ini after his election at the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
&quot; former French players believed that in their quest for success enormous debt had taken , effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ ki@@ cked to ruin , if banks or owners went back their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P declined from concentration on the debts of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abr@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - a club with potential purchased and then strongly invested to build the team and build a global brand - a harder matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P period , which will run until 2018 , Club losses can amount to EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini in 2015 has fallen from the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEF@@ A successor Aleks@@ ander will continue to horror at any one of excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who at UEF@@ A for FF@@ P is responsible to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the Buy @-@ out clause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a flat bowl , it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its treaty . &quot;
&quot; Ne@@ ym@@ ar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the resolution can be reported for the next five years in the amount of 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million euros in the annual financial statements . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has taken the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , located in the possession of Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a penalty of EUR 60 million ( then 82 million dollars ) , which later was reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members stand for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players remained limited . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to list their financial supervision by offering their earnings by companies , who are associated with the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a cat@@ cher company could not exceed the PS@@ G , if the value of the sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be regarded as legitimate incomes . &quot;
&quot; that happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsor of the P@@ SA was blown by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it has been reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar on payments of the Organ@@ ic Committee of the World Cup in Qatar could come .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have denied that Ne@@ ym@@ ar World Cup will be able to figure out and such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A Reg@@ ul@@ ators could easily find out .
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G means that the UEF@@ A will be more attentive , every attempt to consider the rules . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G on Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
they mentioned under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press since they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015 / 16 .
the accounts for the last financial year will have to be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects that Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s arrival is a bo@@ on for sponsorship @-@ deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ c@@ aries . &quot;
the association considers that sales will rise by at least 30 per cent by signing a minimum of 30 percent .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly ir@@ ri@@ fied to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s way by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; financed D@@ oping &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish Daily AS in regard to Qatar &apos;s last owners at PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state that financed an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owners and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football throughout the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; as soon as a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it will be very difficult to respect the finan@@ ci@@ ble Fair@@ play , because you can have different ways or have different interests if one country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is searching for a new shock supply
in the past few years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Board @-@ chocolate has produced for Swiss Life .
now the committees collabor@@ ated with a possible end : the airline re@@ jects the job .
Swiss @-@ Spe@@ aker at Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency S@@ DA a corresponding report by the &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; newspaper .
&quot; according to current planning , the Air@@ line will end up a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be tested every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
&quot; around 17 million small red @-@ white sho@@ ots bo@@ bs up to 14 grams per year in front of landing at the passengers . &quot;
Swiss costs did not want to provide information about the cost .
&quot; industry in@@ sider value the order volume under &quot; &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros daughter achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more important is all the advertising effect : for a shock manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
&quot; as many applicants are there with the new tender , the Swiss will not want to betra@@ y them . &quot;
but only Swiss manufacturers will come into question .
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to try out a renewal of the Treaty on Spring 2018 . &quot;
for the S@@ DA the largest Swiss chocolate producer was not available for an opinion .
chocolate panels will be distributed on board their flights since 2006 .
before Swiss a contract signed with the Mig@@ ros daughter Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had supplied with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets .
&quot; the possibility to place the logo , Swiss first and a half years ago led the collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y two and a half years ago . &quot;
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
&quot; on long @-@ haul flights , the customers of First Class with goodies from the Con@@ fis@@ ery jumps were pampered , in Business Class nas@@ ties passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i from Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
&quot; in the short course , Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i is distributed by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and economy class . &quot;

&quot; this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gically due to the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ er years , for the 90 @-@ he @-@ year @-@ Gr@@ unge era ( as the Vor@@ den@@ ch David W@@ ain and Michael Sho@@ wal@@ ter the Sk@@ et@@ ch @-@ Com@@ edy the &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV round ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler , and Paul Ru@@ dd went to larger things . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era permanent memories . &quot;
but as a franchise it feels when the time would be short .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd humour ( it contained a original story for attractive D@@ ose vegetables , which was made by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; going on at the core of the g@@ ags - actor @-@ aged men play dirty children who grow up - nevertheless , they still managed to gain the im@@ possibility of winning the last part of the weather . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who are now adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted , and his par@@ o@@ dy is more than the found@@ ly principle , including a reef to the Stal@@ ker movies of the 90 @-@ er years like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; &quot; ( &quot; The Hand That is the cradle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; at one point , a character is created by an Apple Power@@ Book , some in@@ line Sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the ami@@ able co@@ op ( Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , now Roman@@ un@@ tor , has K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ e@@ au ) still not forgotten . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy v@@ ignant plot included in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always the lessons are the best part of the franchise .
&quot; it makes especially great fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ os Lower beard of &quot; singles , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; there are the moments of accidental del@@ usion that could use this franchise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches that which I will show as his logical conclusion : &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty @-@ Years L@@ ater &quot; , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; at Amazon now reminds on a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to the rev@@ itali@@ zation of the Cold War by &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic B@@ lon@@ de &quot; and even on &quot; G@@ low &quot; with his East vs West Ring@@ eling @-@ I@@ con@@ geography . &quot;
&quot; created by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka created com@@ edy with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director , a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two poli@@ c@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , athe@@ ism and the path of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;
the main rolls - a hard @-@ ot@@ ten@@ er Gregor and an ide@@ alistic Io@@ z@@ sef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogs from Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt is syn@@ ced into English .
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
&quot; there are some nice g@@ ags for watching ( the police spend time watching chess on TV , such as Americans might do with football ) . &quot;
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent play &apos; Fin@@ de the voice out &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is involved so much for the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda drums - a mur@@ derer who has a Re@@ agan mask , is included - that it is often as a single one . &quot;
&quot; for six long episodes , it moves away and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; that was re@@ directed to a lesser length , his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p could better deliver , since Gregor and Io@@ ó@@ z@@ sef again visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who dev@@ oured a pile of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the ingeni@@ ous communist audience is that Western culture can make everything for food .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian creators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with theirs .
blow against drugs @-@ Mafia in the country
the police are a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon in the Black @-@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ circle , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Constance , eating and Stuttgart numerous objects searched , such as the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s Conc@@ eption on Friday closed . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , 15 accus@@ ations were arrested in the age between 25 and 77 years and already en@@ acted arrest warrant against them . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the officials asked large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , guns , as well as several hundred thousand Euros . &quot;
at the same swe@@ eps in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Italians there were German arrest warrant .
therefore the two are probably shipped to Germany .
the action was involved in the Italian and Bav@@ arian investig@@ ators .
&quot; in total , more than 300 poli@@ c@@ emen were in use . &quot;
&quot; the members of the ma@@ fia will re @-@ organized drug crimin@@ ality , severe violence , attempted murder and rob@@ bery and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; already since summer 2016 , the Pro@@ secution of Constance against organised drug trafficking in the South German region have been established . &quot;
&quot; between the national pro@@ secut@@ ors in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo , an intense exchange and the investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily . &quot;
&quot; this was therefore accompanied by four officials from Palermo , on Wednesday morning . &quot;
&quot; in the vision of the investigations , above all Italian pro@@ secut@@ ors settled with the relation to the Italian ma@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; an incident on 27 May in Hü@@ tt@@ re , fired several shots in a restaurant early in the morning , is likely to go to the bank account of the gang . &quot;
ways num@@ b large gaps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; data from citizens that should not arise , &quot; &quot; according to a report the foreig@@ ner in Germany thro@@ ws considerable shortcomings in Germany . &quot;
the lead to some serious mis@@ leading failures in asylum processes .
&quot; the susp@@ ects for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen mode , has pointed out a media report to large gaps in the country @-@ country register . &quot;
&quot; de@@ fici@@ encies in the recorded data could lead to some serious mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations , &quot; warned that in an analysis that is the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the register , there are ten million people with foreign nationality , including about 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data is therefore managed by some 600 foreign agencies in Germany .
&quot; because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far . &quot;
&quot; in fact , data from 1921 were found , &quot; by people who have long been no longer alive , or from citizens that have become German citizens and actually no longer ought to arise in the register . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data inser@@ ts can slow down processes , &quot; says it to the report . &quot;
statistics on dre@@ aming people are over @-@ EU citizens who would not have to travel .
&quot; but such a false condition , however , led to a distorted debate on how to deal with emigr@@ ation , &quot; therefore , it says in analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the federal government obviously have started to return to back refugee families with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children if they have travelled from there . &quot;
&quot; it appears from an internal paper by the Federal Office of Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BAM@@ F ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück Newspaper . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the paper means that the BAM@@ F perform such procedures for families with children , excluding infants and to@@ dd@@ lers - after Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , the paper was practically no longer possible , so the paper below reference to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin agreements , it is responsible for refugees of the EU state , which they first reach . &quot;
&quot; when a migr@@ ant travels to another EU country , the state can send it back to the travel@@ er . &quot;
&quot; to the grounds , the Office now write : &quot; meanwhile the capacity capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has substantially increased . &quot;
Italy gave a guarantee for the inclusion and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ r@@ t@@ HR ) consider these promises to be sufficient .
also other EU states would send refugees back to the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; the internal political spokes@@ person in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke critici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children dro@@ w &quot; &quot; families with children because of the lack of the Italian asylum system , un@@ lawful recording conditions and a threat to the child . &quot;
double @-@ rate result obtained
a total of 220 lit@@ res of blood of living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach living people had already provided the blood @-@ service for other people .
&quot; at least from the twelve citizens , which were awarded on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who shared with his now 100 contributions in the meantime 50 lit@@ res of blood . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the community commen@@ ds the meeting of the Municipal Council to don@@ ate the multi@@ dimensional readiness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is awesome , as our body is laid out for it , and we appl@@ aud the donation that their blood will provide for foreigners , even more un@@ selfish , &quot; under@@ score mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood sp@@ ende helps several people , &quot; explained the seat manager of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , as the preserv@@ atives will be de@@ composed into its components . &quot;
this way three people could benefit from a blood @-@ bed .
&quot; at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported from the actions that are being carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved with 114 don@@ ators , the second best result , &quot; said the DR@@ K circuits . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change into the theatre was brought to higher numbers few years ago . &quot;

Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; the Bank of England is expected to be announced later that interest rates remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation that speculation over a rise in speculation . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; down &quot; , &quot; when it with@@ held the interest rates on family income in the middle of a intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot;
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) with 6 to 2 for keeping interest rates on 0.@@ 25 % , whereby less members have a rise in this month since the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quarterly report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 on 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1,6 % and warned that pressure on fiscal would continue to continue , while inflation is expected to rise in fall under 3 % . &quot;
but they sign@@ alized that in the next few years Z@@ inser@@ tion would be necessary to breed the inflation of Bre@@ xit and she said that the credit costs may need to rise more than expected on the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut economic package that was published a year after the Bre@@ xit .
&quot; it will require time for investment plan , to provide for banks from the coming February to provide 15 billion pounds more within the frame of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central prognosis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak as the pressure on the real@@ time households will continue to be charged to consumption . &quot;
&quot; to the interest rates , it repeated that &quot; a certain resolution of monetary policy &quot; would be required for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; slightly greater &quot; extent than markets expect . &quot;
the markets still forecast the first rise in the third quarter of the year 2020 and another in 2020 .
&quot; the Bank emphas@@ ised that &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; would be limited . &quot;
&quot; the forec@@ ast@@ ed growth forecasts for this and next year are projected in comparison to the 1.9 % and 1,7 % compared with the previous year . &quot;
she has maintained its growth forecasts to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the Po@@ unds fell to these messages compared to the dollar and the euro .
the Po@@ unds fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and decreased by 0.@@ 4 % to 1.@@ 11 euro .
the decision to make no change comes after the recent dis@@ continued growth pay the rising expectations on a tax increase and increased GDP in the second quarter of 0.@@ 2 % in the previous three months to 0.@@ 3 % .
&quot; growth is expected to recover by 0.@@ 3 % in the third quarter , although it will be easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the most recent in@@ flows report offered little enthusiasm for households , which are affected by an increasing inflation and low wages , since the shar@@ pen@@ ing will first get worse before getting better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy cannot prevent the income in the coming years , but she added that wages became clear to the end of their three @-@ year predictions . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also reinforced by increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak pound weight than to compens@@ ate for a part of the lower consumer expenditure . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August after the shocking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the counterpart . &quot;
the bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; prior to the last judgment of the bank on the interest rates , the call was increased after a f@@ itter , as inflation increased pressure on hard pressed households , with three policy makers in July an increase to 0.5 % . &quot;
inflation has declined in the last month of 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.@@ 6 % although the Bank told us that this was expected and will put it in the coming months .
the Bank told the exceed@@ ance in relation to their goal of 2 % be &quot; entirely to the weak Po@@ unds .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ t , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ ler Bro@@ ker , said : &quot; &quot; given the recent review of the s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market should be more competitive again , as the len@@ ders want to finish loud and end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks especially good for those with which the existing De@@ als run and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is to prescri@@ be a controversial HIV @-@ drug 10,000 people .
patients will be obtained from September after a fight before the High Court to finance the drug in the N@@ HS entry into a &quot; transformed &quot; HIV prevention treatment .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that one before the intercourse was captured pre@@ posi@@ tional prophy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the infection risk of roughly 86 percent , now delivered from health service to a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the process , after the Appe@@ als Court of Justice had confirmed that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the Pr@@ EP in spite of the asser@@ tion that local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; the Chess Federation announced on Thursday , was welcomed by N@@ HS England chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be the first to include the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be launched in all of England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ ten@@ posi@@ tional prophy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV @-@ medicines to be taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduces HIV transfer to Inf@@ ection endangered types .
taking Pr@@ EP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs may be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; to those who come for treatment in question , gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and persons with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully . &quot;
&quot; clinics are identified within clinics that have been identified by the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known as known as anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and are registered with a physician doctor can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the programme will have £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medication this week following an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the entire potential of Pr@@ EP by being collected and implemented in a large scale , implemented and implemented in a large scale . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should expand the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot;
&quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ EP , when it is targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic . &quot;
&quot; from September to people , people with high HIV risk gain access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subjected to a negotiation with a partner that leads to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority has to be done that the study has been carried out quickly throughout the country and no one who has left a risk for HIV . &quot;
&quot; now , as the Pr@@ EP test medicine was created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , shadow @-@ Health Minister , said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is long @-@ long delays and hesit@@ ant implementation through the government welcome and over@@ due . &quot;
the evidence showing how transformed this drug as a part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible all over the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that it will contribute to bringing the end to the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
life living : mezz@@ anine and clever designers tricks have transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment in a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , res@@ isted 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne &apos;s bags not packed and sold off their bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex at Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; I was looking for something , which was comparable to my price . &quot;
&quot; this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings . &quot;
I fell in love with them and made an offer on this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first inspection , the 1,000 square footage was completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a sol@@ dered layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne &apos;s storage room and mezz@@ anine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , they commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , which was 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the blan@@ ket was not big enough to place two rooms to one another , so the architectural challenge was to create a mezz@@ anine in which one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think creative thinking to solve the default .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were over@@ thrown over , without having to decorate . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this order enabled the fan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of extra drama .
for the mezz@@ anine a classic copper window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us can look down over the glam@@ orous living space .
&quot; mir@@ r@@ ored gold @-@ furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination put the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ r@@ ored , to make it last longer . &quot;
in the kitchen the mirror feels like a window to another room .
at the entrance we offer mir@@ r@@ ored units space for all the seating and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; thanks to the perception of a glam@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can fill the kitchen when it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
what is special about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering art went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , fur@@ y M@@ DF door . &quot;
&quot; it is very important , so it is when you push the door very easily , very easily . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne additional 16 m ² could win , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base sheet - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a rudi@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will come up and perform a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
&quot; here , they managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high quality materials , which gives the space its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional connection in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not love yourself into the electric plu@@ gs in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of some standards in something quite unusual .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this one . &quot;
brothers are fighting for a 500 million US dollar real estate .
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in an analysis because of one of the biggest real estate Imperial Vict@@ ori@@ as in the value of more than 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club , and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets are being divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute over separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , brothers spent 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street , Col@@ ling@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West of West@@ co jeans , and grew up to a chain of 160 retail business . &quot;
in 1999 it was sold for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis comprises now offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; according to an agreement with her departed father Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; &quot; main operator and the dominating personality &quot; &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
a jurisdiction states that this means that Col@@ in property has property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul valued at 17@@ 6 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the proposed resolutions proposed by Col@@ in proposed him with what I kept for the best objects , he wrote in 2015 in an initial aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed offices , the first hearing was held by the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; the brothers now fight for control of the existing business - from which Col@@ in , as Paul claimed to be excluded . &quot;
&quot; argued that this is not true , but puts Paul ahead of managing some possessions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it that was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hope to dispute the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my itali@@ an heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cost increases in the event , with hundreds of pages with monkeys , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and both sides of law firms . &quot;
Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her departed husband Luigi were the Italian immigrants that run milk @-@ bars and delicacies from the late 1950 @-@ s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early 1970s .
&quot; they used the security to buy the Col@@ ling@@ wood Lie@@ ber@@ Property , opened in the Col@@ in the first je@@ wels of the family . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in says that he began to West@@ co there when he was in High School in my last years , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property to their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted to land the brothers in court , &quot; wrote them . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark paid 10 million dollars in leaving the company for 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark are , so &quot; &quot; Paul &quot; &quot; became bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in has held very backward , although he was a former AF@@ L member and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV stars . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their attor@@ neys .
&quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; I really cannot say much , &quot; &quot; because the case before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sorry that my brother Paul has decided to mo@@ urn me and draw our family names through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of 2016 , Col@@ in wrote to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father did not want to say that Paul and I would end in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said &quot; &quot; I still hope for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be past .
&quot; our issue will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot;
Tr@@ umps of new head chief is planning to restrict the media ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence of the president .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if yes , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; pol@@ tico tells that the new rod of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow to President Tr@@ ump , including the reports of the news media - hoping to keep the boss on an equivalent course . &quot;
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new governor of the White House , met at his first working day with senior employees , he set a main problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House which he fixed : poor information that enter into the hands of the President . &quot;
&quot; Kelly told the staff that information on him should flow - whether on paper or in brie@@ f@@ ings , because the president would make better decisions , if he would receive good information . &quot;
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ apping Tr@@ ump by monitoring its critics . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ umps relationship to TV reaches decades back - and now , where he is in the White House , his television is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if Candi@@ ump was anno@@ yed because of an unfair reporting , it was productive to show it to convince him that he was a fair reporting of places that were to convince , &quot; said the former election advis@@ er Sam Nun@@ berg in February to Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; &quot; the key to hold p@@ umps Twitter &apos;s habit under control , according to six former election leaders in it , to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ umps Twitter is ever &quot; under control &quot; was ridiculous .
perhaps these fight @-@ officials know something that we don &apos;t know others - that Tr@@ umps can contain even more ig@@ ni@@ tion without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about T@@ we@@ et that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
&quot; if his employees have succeeded in preserving the trouble of him , then their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; but no one has consistently prevent it , that there is dre@@ ary control . &quot;
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a white house , composed of competing parties , always try to present their own agenda by adding Tr@@ ump material , which possibly encourages their views of the world . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the consultants , the president of strategic reasons of undeni@@ able information . &quot;
this was an example described by re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump can react as a volcano on negative press sections , especially those with sh@@ ame@@ ful le@@ aks , and that he can find out where they originate . &quot;
&quot; that happened at the end of February when someone called the president of mali@@ cious a printed copy of an article of Got@@ news@@ .com , the website of the Internet @-@ pro@@ voc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy governor of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh to be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks to be in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of Schi@@ kan@@ en or that he has not offered any concrete evidence , or that he expressed false accus@@ ations in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke her . &quot;
Tr@@ ump reading the article and started to ask staff about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former rod of Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the Tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did this work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager as pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence . &quot;
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys Mission very difficult .
Me@@ ist@@ ad@@ ored Cri@@ cher get mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the help of the population is praying and hoped . &quot;
the police in all Europe are shipped this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous criminals on the run .
&quot; since the addresses of the sought @-@ looking heavy duty are not known , clu@@ es of the population will be hoped and pray . &quot;
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action that follows the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; Adv@@ ent@@ Calendar of winter .
&quot; the experiences could have shown that many volati@@ le places hide from their destinations , called it by Euro@@ pol . &quot;
one has put 21 post@@ cards for selected criminals from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ o has been available for more than 2.5 million times . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online gest@@ ures could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to clu@@ es after the publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return back to the &apos; Million@@ aires &apos; series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands stand once again with some determined travelers on the war of war , which have negotiated a field before their manor @-@ houses . &quot;
the travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a aff@@ lu@@ ent street of Soli@@ h@@ ull which is called the &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they have been thrown out in May without being removed from one by the Council of excav@@ ated dit@@ ch to prevent their accidents . &quot;
the tak@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense buildings and expressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; desol@@ ate inhabitants have pushed the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it &apos; useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabitants said , &quot; They are moved to the Monday after they were sent out by Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones at the pas@@ sers . &quot;
&quot; the Council must indeed be forced by shame on implementation , since it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travellers were there in May , were moved and are now back . &quot;
&quot; more arrived last night , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham know how to handle it by keeping long instructions to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on the Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my com@@ mon@@ dest@@ ein , if the council cannot stop it once . &quot;
&quot; a planet who did not want to be called , said , &quot; It &apos;s ridiculous we just have seen the last round of these travelers , just to lo@@ oted from another round . &quot;
&quot; the numbers have increased this time , and you even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot;
&quot; speaking at the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , we are aware of a un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to proceed as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our collection , it is very important that most people report a anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court must test , when we present our case . &quot;
from Birken@@ hof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be opened again on the 1st of March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closure of the Hotel Birken@@ hof by the then ambience , operating company mbH went to April 13 , 2014 and was lost around 30 000 nights per year and also revenues of the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in the face of a dramatic rise of the numbers of refugees who came to the county , the hotel building was offered as collective accommodation , leading to controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the territory as a hotel location .
the decision was then not un@@ disputed at that time in the council .
&quot; but above all Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Upper Os@@ s@@ wald , defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house . &quot;
he should be right .
the group of Lu@@ isen@@ hotels with chair@@ men Bir@@ git Sch@@ aller with seat in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof with a voluntary auction in Berlin and will make it back to a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Men &apos;s Men .
&quot; you hot hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof has long ago been a construction service in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house , it will be clear what extensive renovation work are done . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ ils have been extracted , blankets to the part un@@ built , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do in March .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ los@@ ers in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black @-@ style style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large wal@@ kable showers , the entrance area is surrounded , new windows will be built . &quot;
&quot; everything sol@@ le later &quot; &quot; nice bourgeois &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ ers express . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a jewelry . &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment . &quot;
&quot; it would not position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale downtown level , stresses the case . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set up in a broad setting , outlines the inner further . &quot;
&quot; both individual holiday makers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
discussions with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause he has already been guided .
the ideas of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; according to the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ ers does not want to set itself exactly . &quot;
&quot; under a million euros , he counts . &quot;
&quot; also , the outdoor facilities are brought to the foreground , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard emerges a large terrace , which is publicly available from the restaurant , which is publicly available . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : us @-@ Special Rap@@ id@@ ler sets the Grand Jury
&quot; in Russia &apos;s Aff@@ air around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Robert Mu@@ eller is supposed to have submitted a so @-@ called Grand Jury for a report . &quot;
&quot; the panel was recorded in the previous few weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; calling on appeal to the cause of trusted persons . &quot;
the paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded and intensified his investigations .
the transm@@ itter CN@@ N reported that there was already the first inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ mi@@ xes in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ umps el@@ dest son and a Russian Ombud@@ sper@@ son .
U.S. secret services acc@@ use the Krem@@ lin since prolonged , targeted in the presidential election in 2016 . &quot;
Mu@@ eller examines if there were Ab@@ yss between the first @-@ called electoral team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigation , several men should stand that acted in the electoral fight as a consultant of the re@@ public@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; report@@ edly , Mu@@ eller also increased more and more m@@ umps private and busy environment among the micro@@ scope . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Rap@@ id@@ ler Tr@@ ump would personally have moved to the Centre and seek the accus@@ ation if the president could have ham@@ pered the judiciary in the course of the affair . &quot;
&quot; the main task of Grand j@@ uries is to examine and decide the evidence of possible failures , and decide whether charges are charged . &quot;
Grand j@@ uries are therefore also called &apos; n @-@ chambers &apos; .
&quot; mostly they are switched on , if it is a larger and controversial cases . &quot;
the process is always behind closed doors .
the Panel may also be switched from the pro@@ secutor &apos;s office to charge persons for ass@@ uring under E@@ id .
&quot; according to the CN@@ N transm@@ itter , CN@@ N were already exhibited , which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
individuals who were involved in the meeting were called to be a statement called it in the report .
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. also Tr@@ umps advis@@ er and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his dam@@ al@@ iger election director Paul Man@@ a@@ fort on the interview with us .
&quot; right @-@ wing experts said on Thursday morning on Thursday television , that the introduction show that Mu@@ eller should not intimi@@ date themselves in his work and that he should be necessary quickly to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the survey of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the determination of Gre@@ mi@@ xes at the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason of concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the President on Thursday morning took a speech in West Virginia to present Russia &apos;s Aff@@ air as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia @-@ history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the topic give the Democrats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about them . &quot;
&quot; his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement , he knew nothing of the installation of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; but this also usually work in secret , stres@@ sing . &quot;
the White House advocate any measures that accelerated the work of the Special agent in a fair &quot; way .
the earlier F@@ BI leader James Com@@ ey had said three times that I will not be determined against the President .
&quot; I have no reason to accept that something changed , it says in the explanation . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey was fired .
&quot; because of this ration@@ ale , accus@@ ations were loud against Tr@@ ump , he did not want to hin@@ der the judiciary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump have asked him for an adjustment of the investigation against the then national security advisor Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; after the presentation of U.S. media , the White House gathered material against the special participants and its employees . &quot;
&quot; the del@@ ectable spec@@ ulations about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wants to release . &quot;
&quot; unlike an independent non @-@ profit of Congress such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be ch@@ ased out of the President of the President of the Justice of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to bend one such step .
&quot; two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic Sen@@ ators stood before the law@@ makers on Thursday , after which the special subscri@@ bers could not be released so easily . &quot;
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg drives in the Antar@@ ctic
&quot; in the western Antar@@ ctic , there has been a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg from the almost seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fi@@ is . &quot;
the divided the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Arctic and marine research on Wednesday .
&quot; the over a tri@@ llion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers big col@@ os@@ sus is now going to the north and will take two , three years until it was mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometers in length and a width of up to 50 kilometers one of the largest ic@@ e@@ gi@@ ants , the researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger for people from him .
&quot; how far the climate change has played a role in the upheav@@ al of the ice @-@ ber@@ ship , according to research information is unclear . &quot;
&quot; in total , there have been a series of uncommon bur@@ sts in the region for about 30 years , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a billing background . &quot;
according to many researchers the warming cannot be combined with the heating of heating .
the broken collagen was so far part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fi@@ is so far .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it continues to grow on the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fi@@ is is located south of South America almost at the head of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula .
north of this stri@@ pe was the balance of wa@@ xing and vom@@ iting a few years ago .
&quot; a complete sho@@ al fe@@ ather was there , writes AW@@ I @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is much talking about that even the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , as the pre@@ ten@@ te c@@ yst@@ ers have never yet withdrawn as far as currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice @-@ stick is under tension and can be crus@@ hed , if there is a piece of keywords . &quot;
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fi@@ is and Eis@@ berg increases the sea level because they swim on the water and pus@@ hes ice so much water as it results after the melting itself .
&quot; however , the loss of shame is causing the gl@@ aci@@ ers to flow straight into the sea and flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in small dimensions , the British research project to the observation of the Antar@@ ctic ( MID@@ AS ) . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fi@@ is is according to AW@@ I @-@ data with almost 50 000 square kilometres , the fourth biggest fo@@ el@@ fo@@ is of the Antar@@ c@@ tica . &quot;
&quot; on the passage from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks regular .
&quot; although it is a natural condition and no direct connection to climate change makes us aware that Eis@@ schild is now in a dangerous shift position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most far retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; if scientists were under dispute whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is now back again sooner or longer fold , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; our models argue that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even though these researchers did not lead the departure of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg not to climate change , so in the past decades many ic@@ e@@ el@@ ves of the ant@@ ar@@ ctic peninsula are crum@@ bled . &quot;
this long qu@@ itting of the Antar@@ c@@ tica extends towards South America .
&quot; according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice @-@ surface of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula is decreased by 28 000 square kilometers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the temperature in temperature has contributed . &quot;
&quot; the Antar@@ ctic peninsula rose in the past 50 years by about three degrees warmer , and thus in the areas where the temperature is fastest . &quot;
CD@@ U wants to start Hau@@ star@@ if at the staff
&quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy free places , the CD@@ U is demanding to step out of the Emplo@@ yers Federation to become more attractive . &quot;
only shortly before the summer break the Kre@@ ist@@ ag has won 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the government agency in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now even 17 apprenti@@ ces have their first working day after themselves .
the teachers in the circle are obviously very popular .
some 6@@ 20 applications have been listed for the places this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the Circle continued to go on personnel to cope with the raised requirements and tasks . &quot;
&quot; at present , there are still 50 non @-@ occupied positions at the circle M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot;
we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces in general administration .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG initiative and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in administration .
the administration should be based on the desire of the parties &quot; a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to meet not only short @-@ term needs of specialists , but are future @-@ oriented of the applicants . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be oriented towards inside and outside , provide concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and involve a educational background , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds like a good approach .
for the circle has to do with personal problems which you didn &apos;t know earlier .
other cities promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms .
the speech is given by a &quot; right &quot; contest of the public employers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a high number of employees , disease or age @-@ related caused by the Service arrives . &quot;
&quot; so the highest time for action , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; yet Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , Leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint application with his party . &quot;
he was already long since in Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a worth@@ less surprise when he was publicly challenged the staff of personnel and the remaining parties ple@@ aded .
&quot; peoples wants to be verified , that all possibilities will be verified , which enable an ex@@ iting from the municipal employers &apos; association . &quot;
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution at short notice , the self @-@ government should be aiming at trade unions - perhaps even in collaboration with the regional cities - a &quot; &quot; home @-@ tariff &quot; , &quot; such nations . &quot;
&quot; this is thus trying to pay the CD@@ U , the employees and officials to pay better than the collective services for the public sector . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money there are only if you change to a higher level which is oriented towards professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees are concerned with the provisions of the new pro@@ stitutes . &quot;
not least thanks to the rising number of asylum seekers Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter has a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy exac@@ erb@@ ated the sound to NGO @-@ migrants
&quot; Italy , NGOs who use the li@@ f@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea , warned that they cannot continue this when they do not comply with new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not submit a new Code of Conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized the German relief organization &apos; youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their team worked effectively with men &apos;s hands in a way that facilitated the illegal immigration .
&quot; the aid organisation , which has only been in operation since one year , declined to speak to detailed demonstrations of the Italian national government Amb@@ ro@@ gio Carto@@ sio . &quot;
&quot; for us , the salvation of human life remains our top priority . so we are sorry that we cannot operate at the moment in the search and rescue zone , &quot; the organization said in an opinion on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can only estimate the accus@@ ations that are being collected , only after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had the boat of &apos; youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , had been surve@@ yed since October . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that its crew will take din@@ gh@@ y migrants on board , which can be delivered directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that the smu@@ g@@ gler can leave , so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; for at least one such coincidence , only 1,3 miles from the Libyan coast took place , according to the pro@@ secutor &apos;s acts whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
the occupation is suspected to compens@@ ate about the authority of the Italian coastal Guard and the rescue operations in the area for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
&quot; among the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta have to have an Italian police officer who supervis@@ es their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations , have so far declared to stick to the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday , that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; significant changes or &quot; obstruc@@ tions &quot; of their life@@ actions . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates @-@ organization doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; Minn@@ iti said in the meantime , that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations in Italy , the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local civil societies have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month , about economic development initiatives and with Ch@@ ad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that could rely on these countries in the hope of being able to reach Europe . &quot;
An@@ c@@ ages and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine m@@ ist bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin out@@ posts &quot; and two guest @-@ drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region to enjoy four days of tri@@ b@@ als and points of interest . &quot;
there were three free guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome Extra .
the first tour led to hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above di@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; it was followed by lookout spots , partly on towers , of which one could look far beyond the Pf@@ al@@ zer forest and the up@@ stream levels . &quot;
in between there were always longer ill@@ ages for the long tri@@ b@@ als .
on the second day there went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and for a festival market .
&quot; once again , viewpoint at lookout spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate accus@@ ations . &quot;
the last two days were again a lot of altitude meters .
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and dri@@ fts made welcome breaks . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim at@@ me@@ tered the bi@@ ker in the free@@ wheel of the cur@@ atorium br@@ ine .
also new town was driven .
&quot; after 17@@ 3 kilometers and almost 4@@ 500 meters , the group had seen the pa@@ wns forest from its best side - sporty and culturally . &quot;
console instead of grass - Bundesliga gears up for e @-@ sport
&quot; continue to sit down the sport @-@ stars in future prior to computer consoles , instead of trying to fight with wind and weather over the stadium ? &quot;
&quot; fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high levels . &quot;
this also recognized the first Bundes@@ li@@ ga@@ des who are increasingly involved in this area .
&quot; in early July 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , which followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , which founded mid July an E @-@ Sport department and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire completely new young audiences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jo@@ chen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
it is certain that on this turn he can rise a lot of clubs .
&quot; in the coming weekend , the soccer world association FIFA will organize FIFA in London the first &apos; Interactive Club World Cup , in which the gam@@ ers of various clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven quali@@ fies . &quot;
also Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es a agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real football must deal with the 14 to 30 years of age , that young people will still go into the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs trying to conquer all kinds of markets , especially the Asian . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under the treaty , one could be more often more often present on these markets than once a year to send the federal government to Asia . &quot;
what is this exactly ?
&quot; at the E @-@ Sport computer games like &quot; League Of Le@@ gends , &quot; &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just the football simulation of FIFA on competition level . &quot;
&quot; long ago , as in normal sport , Li@@ gen have become established where the pros compete against each other . &quot;
and in the Asian @-@ play E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a real sport ?
for many the idea is most likely to be used .
also In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ous has been apart the issue for a long time .
&quot; for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , E @-@ Sports is a sport because it is com@@ promis@@ ingly and show many biological and physical responses that can be seen in classical sport - for example , increased heart frequencies , stress levels , hormonal changes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it requires cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction capability . &quot;
professional gam@@ er should exercise not only on the console but also exercise their body and watch on nutrition .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; F@@ rob@@ ous also looks problems : &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more important . &quot;
controls are hard @-@ contro@@ ll@@ able at online @-@ games and in the scene were lacking the structures of classical sports .
positive presents the scientists the high Integr@@ ative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
&quot; players are internationally on the way , which is like a big global family , since there are no intercultural obstacles . &quot;
a study of corporate consulting Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the E @-@ Sport a rapid growth ahead .
&quot; in fact , in Germany 50 million euros have been implemented , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ing and major tournaments . &quot;
sales will be at 130 million in three years .
against the nearly 2.@@ 4 billion euros of the Bundesliga in the Bundesliga .
&quot; however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot;
international are many countries already .
large markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ Bas@@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez are participating in the US Team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ashton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport competition providers Uni@@ kr@@ n .
even in Europe a lot of things are doing .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sports was introduced as educational , F@@ rob@@ ous says . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and in France the football @-@ first Bundesliga associations , according to D@@ utt , are now oblig@@ ated to set up an E @-@ Sport section . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany was lag@@ ging , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ board Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; fall only in nostal@@ gia , and clear the old times , is no longer enough today . &quot;
&quot; it is about preserving the tradition of the association , but the company at the same time align in the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ alised world , &quot; says also D@@ utt . &quot;
&quot; you cannot cling to it , that only for football everything remains as it was always . &quot;

&quot; Michelle Carter because of the lyrics , the Con@@ rad Roy has been pushing for suicide , &quot;
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encourages her friend through lyrics and calls to suicide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were exposed to par@@ ole . &quot;
Carter was condemned in June due to neg@@ ligent killing of Con@@ rad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; my family is in@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free of charge .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum of 20 years , but their legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered in a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red tro@@ users and a cre@@ ed @-@ colored bl@@ use , Carter as with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down @-@ directed eyes , when she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions have brought &quot; &quot; Con@@ rad Roy &quot; , &quot; said the pro@@ secutor of the judgment . &quot;
they ended his life to make their own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility yet , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it has no re@@ mor@@ se , shown . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ te &apos;s lawyer said , it was a &quot; terr@@ ent &quot; circumstance that she is completely regret . &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz told however , he did not find out that her &quot; age or maturity , or even their cl@@ ergy , have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a pro@@ secutor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day in which I do not lament on the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I go with everything . I try , despite all my pains that we will carry with us for eternity with us , to be there for his sisters . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she will be pro@@ secuted by the knowledge &quot; that she will never be part of his brother &apos;s wedding or would be a aun@@ t for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this only person to have with whom I have been together since my birth every day , is a pain that I will always keep in mind for the rest of my life . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to set a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to commit someone else to commit suicide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy has been found dead from a carbon mon@@ tory poison@@ ing in one vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case drawn up national attention , after car@@ et@@ ted text statements revealed that they had encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hanging around , Spring of a building , first e@@ ech thee , I do not know there are many ways , &quot; she told in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide wrote them , &quot; &quot; You have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; All that you have to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told that Carter &apos;s attention due to the death of Roy and orda@@ ined that she could benefit by any press from the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; among the few who defended Carter , Amanda Kno@@ x , who was condemned by Mor@@ des at their British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in Los Angeles Times on a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not in prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the new mini @-@ L@@ ame of FC Bayern
that Joshua was allowed to run at the Audi Cup as captain is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern does not trust the Con@@ fed Cup winner a big season - extra motivation while not .
&quot; something was different on his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua Kim@@ ber@@ me immediately , even when the extra garments was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but since wide and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups of course , no Philipp L@@ ame and no Manuel Neu@@ er was to be seen , he made his mark on his arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner after his first bet as Bayern @-@ captain . &quot;
&quot; well , the one could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the sign from the coach could also indicate me so .
&quot; not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was made in the youth play@@ mates , deb@@ ators and just chosen from the holiday professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a player &apos;s guide , but he . &quot;
&quot; su@@ gars are indeed distributed by su@@ gars , and are the dearest to those who wish to put a lot in the mood . &quot;
&quot; who are so chosen to compete with L@@ ame of L@@ ame , can use a small extra motivation only good . &quot;
Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility .
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as mini @-@ L@@ ame over the field .
&quot; right behind , that is now its position , the white bin@@ der on the arm did its rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , Kim@@ ber@@ ed me in this starting @-@ up language as the one who can best take the Ru@@ ins at the best . &quot;
he gave instructions to ste@@ er the imp@@ aired tro@@ upe .
&quot; he had a look for the whole , while many others were busy with themselves . &quot;
&quot; Vid@@ al thus to play his lack of fitness ( folding hardly ) ; Renato San@@ ches with it , on the Devil come out to tie out to the achievements of the Asia @-@ journey ( fol@@ ly also only partly ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le to drop in their first appearance in Bayern @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t . &quot;
&quot; after all , this is quite good . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy in front of the resistance , both agi@@ an sovereign . &quot;
&quot; the renowned Nap@@ oli storm was often hard , in addition , Sü@@ le tried to succeed in building up a few times as well . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy was to say that the result was &quot; not as long as we hoped that . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; game shift , temp@@ o change : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; like unusual , this Bavaria @-@ world lives even for the new appro@@ achable , it looked after the game . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ dy for example , in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs not one or two , but surely six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ me passed a few cr@@ acking statements in his new fellow @-@ players in the back of his new fellow @-@ players .
&quot; there he heard an interesting phrase from Sü@@ le , saying , &quot; &quot; What is going down here I already noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just need to win every game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he does not have to teach the new . &quot;

company satisfied with the rh@@ einf@@ alls : economy lo@@ fts Wis@@ ła Tempo
&quot; it often had an irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) , nor Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate . &quot;
&quot; this is evident after more than one year , in which the new Minister for Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
chambers and companies from the region speak at T V request from a change in economic policy - and at the same time bl@@ ero@@ ded the old minister .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; Know about the desires of the economy , the Lem@@ ke all has blocked . &quot;
the biggest about @-@ face sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the bridge of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Adenauer is now at the top of the country &apos;s primary list .
&quot; this year the ministry is hoping for a planning process , until now the building should be right . &quot;
&quot; a role in the country &apos;s plans does also play the West@@ um@@ ble@@ ak Tri@@ er , which is on the urgent need of the federal road . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to take the circuit in December 2020 in operation , says Secretary of Minister of Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ us sees in it a sign for regional , but internationally competitive companies . &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Tri@@ er strives to boost the market in supermarkets in the wine @-@ country @-@ Palat@@ inate Label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports for ten years .
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing have an open ear for people who want to start their own company , commen@@ ds the Chamber of Commerce . &quot;
&quot; the Handwerk@@ skammer Tri@@ er sees in the new master bonus an additional incentive for young trainees , says CEO Matthias swal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; provided is an premium of 1000 Euro for the constitu@@ ent master test and 2500 euros , if graduates are independent within ten years after the formation . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; the planned road building were quick to create facts , at the same time lack the country on the necessary staff , says Jan bel@@ auer , chief executive director of the Chamber of Industry Tri@@ er Tri@@ er . &quot;
&quot; from 56 new engineers who want to adjust the knowledge of the local mobility , up to 29 places have been occupied so far . &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; CD@@ U spokes@@ person Christian Bal@@ d@@ on refers to calculations of the invo@@ icing , the country invested in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of state highways . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to solve the shortage of skilled workers in the region . &quot;
ern@@ hum@@ id is also the previous broad@@ band ship@@ building in the country .
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had only rated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey , with only the 3.4 . &quot;
they are compl@@ ained about St@@ opping Internet connections and break@@ downs .
&quot; in contrast , ex @-@ economic ministries in E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind . &quot;
&quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ ke on April to be president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months due to dis@@ agreement , the field has already returned . &quot;
&quot; Audi is to change 3@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction . &quot;
&quot; one day prior to the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would be offering to update the software in more than 35@@ 0.000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW @-@ president said the company is the opinion that &quot; &quot; there is smar@@ ter options as a constra@@ int , &quot; and related to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to ban or limiting the limit . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described companies as a recall .
European automobile manufacturers have strongly supported the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but the nit@@ rogen oxi@@ des , the diesel engines , are regarded as car@@ cin@@ o@@ genic and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; to install the costs for automobile manufacturers , plants for neutr@@ alization of diesel vehicles to install , take also what it makes it difficult to hold the price of the cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel also is also charged to pamp@@ er the powerful car firms and ignore signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut@@ down devices to adhere to the rules if a car was tested , but back in normal travel conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States several employees were indicted by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
last month the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics in the motor development of Audi was arrested in Germany .
&quot; the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be lod@@ ged in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigation in Volkswagen , after the authorities used to have installed a system to deal with the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could strain Volkswagen &apos;s hard burden : the luxury car manufacturer contributes significantly to the profit of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es and laughter against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ dill@@ o was temporarily one of the most widely published cartoon by carto@@ on@@ ists , the Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es of his characters are his trademark . &quot;
also with 85 the Argent@@ inian is still working and works on a film .
&quot; his message : lau@@ ghing , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guillaume Mor@@ dill@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he worked out as a artist for luck @-@ post@@ cards - which was frustrated . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; after touring in Lima , New York and Paris at the end of the 1960s he succeeded : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ dill@@ o found many fans .
again and again the artists of cities inspire .
&quot; large , rounded Mor@@ dill@@ o @-@ figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the sli@@ ce tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; according to the early morning , he is still sitting on the drawing day , and works almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; cal@@ en@@ dar@@ s , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush animals and clo@@ cks can continue to find his threatened figures worldwide . &quot;
he has been working on a animated film and a TV series for six years .
&quot; the main character in the movie &quot; &quot; Crazy Island &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los any test@@ es animal in his drawings - that has a thou@@ sand@@ wi@@ dd@@ ler as a counterpart . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which is expected to come to the film wall . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it is strange to me , &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ dill@@ o . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; that is why he looks more to the TV series , which is produced , like its original names , wor@@ t@@ less . &quot;
lav@@ ender threatened by climate change
&quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; lav@@ ender is due to the disease of drought and due to illness @-@ borne insects decl@@ ining , resulting in scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions , great headaches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ m , Expert of the Agricultural Research Institute of CR@@ IE@@ PP@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the L@@ aven@@ del in Provence is effectively je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed because the plant in recent years has been exposed to the effects of climate change that has brought much less rainf@@ all in the spring and in autumn much more . &quot;
this has an effect on the life of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small brick , a micro@@ bacteria , transm@@ its the d@@ warf @-@ ti@@ des , and with very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot;
and there is much at stake .
Lav@@ end@@ el@@ oil l@@ ures not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers ; it is also highly sought for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
&quot; Eric Cha@@ m said : &quot; instead of having very long plant watches with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; among the solutions that are considered , a better water distribution and the slo@@ wing of the ev@@ ap@@ ing out of the ground , but also the test of plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are capable of drought resistant . &quot;

the assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the employees of the Week@@ ly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ hal@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and ceas@@ eless drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
it was communicated to them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists are discussing what to feel safer : they should take their children to the office , which in 2009 were the goal of an attack with gran@@ ates , or leave them home . &quot;
&quot; safety experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room : enemies , Neutr@@ al , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the re@@ porter to propose names for each column - no proof is needed , perceptions and abdom@@ en . &quot;
&quot; there are drugs agency , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the secret list of government or cart@@ els , a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no resting break from the violence , and while the cor@@ p@@ ses of the cor@@ p@@ ses , there are more and more journalists : at least 25 , since President Enri@@ que Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to took place in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 stood by attacks and threats under federal protection and up to now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year . &quot;
&quot; among the latter , her editors and their Inspir@@ ator from Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his many books on violence associated with drugs . &quot;
&quot; his lack is felt deeply , although its presence everywhere is present - a great photo of Val@@ dez , which shows its mid@@ finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; , hanging onto the façade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building . two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , carry T @-@ shirts , who show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death and the re@@ porter discuss about their shared topics , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although 2010 a Son@@ der @-@ Bundes@@ an@@ wald was established to process the cases of journalists , according to the Committee aimed at protecting journalists only two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders , who are associated each year with drug trafficking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely exposed to trial . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are in@@ tr@@ it@@ ous and although the terrain is now even tra@@ itors . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting at the discussion of safety has little value , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very silly to squ@@ ander my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know the Why , we mis@@ trust all . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the provincial capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he managed just to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car , and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - the &quot; &quot; T@@ wel@@ d river &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the cap was driving away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez has been 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to be able to wander freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans re@@ ation last year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions are fighting to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ hal@@ a every day someone or more people are shot on the road , or that the cemetery is full of dedicated , two @-@ story mouse @-@ ole@@ ans for drugs of drugs , which are bigger than many houses for the living . &quot;
&quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility , &quot; if only a cart@@ el control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States . &quot;
&quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez has become aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February the publication of a interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival@@ ing cart@@ els in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this release may have been anno@@ yed the sons , suspected power members purchased each copy of the output on , as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper which had published the same story to leave the country its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez has been a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing will be considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived such a long time to im@@ itate his friends and colleagues that he would always be there .
&quot; he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues for the foundation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ hal@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journalism without encounter@@ ing the do@@ w@@ ry problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; in time , the newspaper earned a reputation for the bold and honest reporting , and the revenue and publicity . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porter loved it to be able to publish hard and accurate investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by one publication in which they were able to read stories . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; &quot; for their coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez has won the &quot; International Press Freedom Award &quot; of the Committee to protect journalists from persecution of Mexican drugs history , wherever they were . &quot;
he gave up voluntarily to be afraid that he was afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV in October last October . &quot;
you will have to take the task that you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; What have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the spa@@ wning bird , who was like a do@@ ckers , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and coun@@ ties , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
you trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ as , the bar towards the office , go and always sit at the same table . &quot;
&quot; well , ask them , was his love for routine his destruction ? &quot;
his death also forced her to ask her own assumptions regarding how to best do their work and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home@@ work and cross @-@ ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
if it smells false , stay away . &quot;
said the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real that &apos; smell can be a sense of dec@@ eived ... and then the thing happens with Javier .
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , apply in Sin@@ hal@@ a - just as not as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ is@@ oned mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home . &quot;
the landscape is constantly changing .
&quot; in the space where the employees of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for safety training , suddenly there were no mobile phones allowed . days previously was known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold solely to governments , used for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
outside two poli@@ c@@ emen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the State Government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ class district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the Scher@@ z , some of the re@@ porters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 per cent of poli@@ c@@ emen , who described the governor themselves as not trustworthy . &quot;
&quot; it has been a few months since the re@@ porters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are actually under control . &quot;
for the issue of this week Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has been blown into three main stories .
it gave the assassination of brother of the former famous box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an Ex@@ pos@@ é to the state spending that focused on the hometown of the Govern@@ ors .
&quot; and there was a group that resulted in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s office . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or how it happened , so caution was advisable when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite locally of drug dealers and administr@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porter took out of public records , that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician , who reigned over the entire century all political levels . &quot;
recently several pre@@ i @-@ govern@@ ors have been accused of high @-@ quality cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this pub , among them one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went to a military attack . &quot;
&quot; just a few months before , the reader had viewed the Columbus of Val@@ dez , as the best informed source about kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; in the past we had already knew what is happening , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of his slim physique . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication are crus@@ hed with our sources . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez has been devoted to storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers , which are opposed to the murder of journalists , because the employees have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez sn@@ apped a few signs , and passed the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the pro@@ secutor . &quot;
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared 3 days , after being killed by Val@@ dez , the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its .
throughout the country journalists have become sound@@ pro@@ fied by re@@ written in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on wal@@ k@@ ways and buildings .
&quot; on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is out in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the Governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez , accused the authorities , journalists to withdraw and bring it , because they said the truth . &quot;
&quot; since then , she has asked that she is re @-@ divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated their objectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly told that journalists are in Mexico from organised crime , participating government officials and a &quot; &quot; valid society &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co journalist , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also by order of politicians and security guards which are organised with organised crime under a blan@@ ket . &quot;
&quot; the media &quot; &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; has more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials last year . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico stir@@ ring you because they want you dis@@ proportionate to the mouth , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot;
obviously the mur@@ ders have a de@@ terr@@ ent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; your body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by Z@@ etas @-@ Kart@@ ell , &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer ta@@ stat@@ ur and ear@@ phones were next to their separate head .
some branch have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te at the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assassination of the correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue as it did El Man@@ ana from Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of their Director in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez publicly addressed the Dru@@ k@@ art@@ elle with an editorial on the title page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ?
some journalists are from their home @-@ states or even out of the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and search for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they will be hun@@ ted , like the photographer of Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered by four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay back and continue working , it is a daily dance with risky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , gives to that drug trafficking is scar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; Mexico is going to hell , and therefore I became re@@ porter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last edition was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat in front of the office and drank beer as at once all their phones began . &quot;
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with tap@@ irs and security guards in the vicinity of the bathroom Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
war escal@@ ated continued as promised by a series of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
from the on @-@ board edge you posted the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce about cell phone .
the cover page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens he@@ els near - a further shooting in the area .
&quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez cast a look at the poli@@ c@@ emen , the guards held to see if they were in readiness . &quot;
&quot; if they were afraid of all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the vast portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose medi@@ finger was visible to all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed its tracks . &quot;
&quot; how can you also only think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; if the same day was murdered by Javier , the practic@@ ant asked me to send it to the road reporting . &quot;
din@@ os@@ aur@@ s used cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to do@@ dge his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue albeit a fri@@ ghtening .
&quot; now , researchers have found that the first findings of the unbelievable rhin@@ ocer@@ os of a Canadian min@@ ers were so well preserved that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
&quot; it was so well received that she could even find that his shoe skin was of red@@ dish brown , and they said they could have had something of a &quot; &quot; troubled past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology &quot; awarded him as &quot; the disputed din@@ os@@ aur@@ s , which has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ os@@ aur@@ s specimens of the world . &quot;
&quot; fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , which lived in the middle of the Cre@@ t@@ ace@@ ous period of between 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot;
&quot; his unbeliev@@ ably well preserved state has researchers , which describe it as &quot; truly remarkable &quot; , &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ ater is the best preserved fossil fuel of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he was on 21 March 2011 at Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something that was missing from the surrounding rock at the board , and decided to see more precisely . &quot;
the fossil was discovered by him was sent to the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to expose the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy soil . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the ready result is ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you only blin@@ zeln a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it will go into the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ os@@ aur@@ s , the Mon@@ a Lisa of Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found out that this herbal fres@@ ser , although it is covered with an arm@@ or , and resembles a changing tank , probably by meat @-@ sha@@ kes din@@ os@@ aur@@ s threatened . &quot;
&quot; the highly ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ os@@ aur@@ s used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a par@@ atro@@ city that is known as anti@@ d@@ ding , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed to mix better in its surroundings and do@@ dge his enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by major din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature dating from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier did the first time in May and is now at the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ elli named after the museum techni@@ cian Mark Mitchell , one of a team who has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours with it . &quot;
&quot; the amazing preservation of the copy made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ ors over his body . &quot;
&quot; they discovered counter @-@ sh@@ utter , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the head of the creature was darker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ variation is common , the results are surprising since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is far exceeds that of the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it points out that the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s was hun@@ ted by enough pressure by meat , even din@@ os@@ aur@@ s that the evolution of the confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most of the contemporary animals , which use the counter @-@ atti@@ re - think of deer , z@@ ebras or G@@ ür@@ g@@ ents - are much smaller and vulnerable as loot , which sign@@ aled that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ r was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong predat@@ ory behavior on a massive , strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ os@@ aur@@ s demonstrate how dangerous the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s predat@@ ors of the Cre@@ t@@ ace@@ ous must have been &quot; , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skins also shows that the skin of the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s is brown .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal on references to his life , including its consistent intest@@ ine to figure out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s , when he died , went into a river and pushed into the sea , where he sank onto the back of the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alberta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely much more widespread than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ r is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserv@@ ative skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the result is that the animal today looks almost exactly the same as in the early Cre@@ t@@ ace@@ ous period .
&quot; you do not need much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just have a little bit with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is in sleep . &quot;
&quot; the Cre@@ t@@ ace@@ ous was a time when huge Ther@@ opo@@ den , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s , who stood on two legs standing up the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ aurus Rex , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ op@@ tic rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monster . &quot;
&quot; scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and have been painted in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he was in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum it is the most sophisticated din@@ os@@ aur@@ s in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is complete from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1.@@ 300 kg ) .
&quot; it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips , ra@@ yed by his shoulders . &quot;
&quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ aters was flooded by the Western Canada , until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea . &quot;
but the underwater inspection of the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s kept his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remn@@ ants of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still b@@ umpy panels along the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s .
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as &apos; rare as a win in the lot@@ us . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it , the more conf@@ use it . &quot;
pet@@ ri@@ fied remn@@ ants of the skin still cover the b@@ umpy panels that carry the skull of the animal .
&quot; his right for@@ ef@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are down@@ wards . &quot;
I can count the scales on his sole .
in the storm : Mass Car@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many Ver@@ sions
fierce accident on Thursday night at the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass @-@ car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous wounded , kilometres long St@@ aus - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , on Thursday Thursday morning at a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age about 20 people have been injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the first information of the police were at 17.@@ 00 o &apos;clock between the Cou@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of Ai@@ ch@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm barely 30 cars , among them probably also trucks , inter@@ locking . &quot;
&quot; at first , the exact number of the publishers were not available . &quot;
it is a slight to moderate injury but said a police pre@@ pre@@ cher .
a big lift to rescue vehicles was at the accident location .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
in Tim@@ esh@@ adows Munich a ten kilometers long back @-@ trip was formed .
&quot; as a A@@ Z re@@ porter reports , it also came on the road @-@ road to massive disability through numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the fire@@ fighters have noted the hall@@ mark of the vehicle &apos;s drivers , which now have to reck@@ on with sensitive sanctions . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 hours , then there was a second accident at the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
this was a collision between a car athle@@ te and a car .
a rescue @-@ helicopter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group tested &quot; Comfort check @-@ in
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing escap@@ ing on the train and sleeps .
or one is absorbed into his work and has just an ingeni@@ ous thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and ar@@ ouses an impro@@ per or ri@@ ps the passenger in the middle of the work@@ flow .
ticket control .
but the times of the inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
Deutsche Bahn did not test the booking card control .
simply confirm by mobile phone that you have taken the place and de@@ valu@@ ated the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test run on two routes . &quot;
&quot; when the offer comes from , we expand it . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; a train spokes@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; is called the train card de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner .
&quot; to be able to use it , however , some requirements need to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
&quot; you have to also have bought it via the App of the railway , the DB navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient way of ticket sales . &quot;
and finally you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot; works so : one gets into the train , calling his ticket to &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the test customer then appears a button on the electronic de@@ valuation .
the traction managers are given on their mobile devices a message that chassis X is on the train and took the booked seat .
&quot; if the traction dealer comes to the card control in place , he knows that there is a passenger with already de@@ valu@@ ated online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so one can continue to sleep , continue on to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; who relaxed without ticket control through our train @-@ accompan@@ iment would like to travel , checked in the DB navig@@ ator just yourself . &quot;
&quot; this enables the passengers to create their travel time by train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing @-@ board of DB correspondence . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to address the individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who often drives train , knows that besides delays and cont@@ oured trains the tickets controls are among the greatest off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; for often , in any case , one does not have all the documents that one needs to de@@ generate online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the payment ID is missing or otherwise a document that you have to pre@@ face .
&quot; consequently , there are endless discussion between Zug@@ companion and passenger , which leads to poor mood in the section or great space and delays in control of your own tickets and the activity at the end takes time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this is only available on the T@@ ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further draw numbers on the same track are still un@@ locked yet .
how a activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ?
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was shaken to her heart .
&quot; just one day after she arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis sat on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that rented it and scroll through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
they stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police had just killed a 18 @-@ year child , and it is still on the street , &quot; says it there . &quot;
&quot; confused , since no one else had posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saving on her tim@@ eline .
&quot; the R@@ apper from the territory of St. Louis was involved , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white poli@@ cem@@ an in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , M@@ on . , killed live on twe@@ et . &quot;
&quot; he po@@ sted a picture of bro@@ wns le@@ blo@@ ated body , which was stretched on the road and staying there four hours . &quot;
&quot; that is yes wild , &quot; said Fer@@ rell . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she placed her cell phone in order to return to T@@ we@@ et via people on the Can@@ field drive .
&quot; there were pictures of the police band and people , the scre@@ amed , and of a man who claimed to be Bro@@ wns &apos;s father , who wor@@ e a sign with the ins@@ cription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they watched a live @-@ feed with which a poli@@ cem@@ an was faced with a group of prot@@ esters with a bar@@ king dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , un@@ insured another poli@@ cem@@ an his ri@@ f@@ le and cried : &quot; I will kill you ... I will all kill you . &quot;
&quot; this is not usual , &quot; Fer@@ rell reminded of her statement . &quot;
that is not the kind of murder we got used to and which we can have typical .
at that moment I felt sha@@ king .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
you booked a flight back and went home the next day .
&quot; after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she fet@@ ched her father &apos;s daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; in cinemas from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and the protest , love and loss of resistance , of strength and resistance , which consists of the sight of the people who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who carried a flower @-@ dress and a suitable crown , the two went a conversation that she had countless times prior to this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; you remember , how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; remember what she said . &quot;
&quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police had killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not bring it , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
that which is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
you have to know and see it and be raised in it .
&quot; it must be well designed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally has not experienced any bl@@ at@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would turn her a bad service to keep them away . &quot;
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which was a camp for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
there Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared pockets before and hal@@ ted them to pass on prot@@ esters .
slowly began to embrace a new type of activ@@ ism for the h@@ ectic form .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had no experience in organizing . &quot;
it has all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell met for an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar , wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question was Fer@@ rell in mind : &quot; do you document , or try to find a story that you can exploit ? &quot;
&quot; this scep@@ ticism was nourished by countless cases of men , often from wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from her sorrow and their resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an said recently in an interview : &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and have not raised their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an already worked together with the former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field , known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought the project closer to Fer@@ rell &apos;s project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Bro@@ ught Er@@ go . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we talk , &quot; Davis said . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , because so I will be shown . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ells &apos; experience - to show that it deals with the movement &quot; &quot; not about a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most open@@ in in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; demonstrate their documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ is life , as she loves themselves and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like sitting naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the de@@ human@@ ization of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ er &apos;s story repeated the role of black gay women in the wider black @-@ lives @-@ live movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the Movement , which after the kill@@ ings of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; black , gay men in man@@ ag@@ erial positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are fighting in various fronts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay men must wear the main last of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; the movement is kept alive by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; it however , however , is that &quot; this is not a affir@@ m@@ ist type of action , &quot; in which Fer@@ rell has been selected as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sho@@ ok this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is not a coincidence , although it was at the front front , because in a life of these crosses as a black , gay woman standing so much at stake . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years due to the block@@ age of a highway in a demonstration .
it describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area that they call their home : &quot; a mess .
&quot; nevertheless she cl@@ am@@ ated to a song , and she feels bound to this memory since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on for three years ago . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;

&quot; the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; Pop@@ ulation and Bit@@ burg &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the one to say to the Bit Gallery : &quot; this would be a dream ( &quot; &quot; An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; This would be real class &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side , &quot; &quot; does not need a man &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi Bet@@ zen ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; scale &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while the advocates re@@ pro@@ pon@@ ents that a gallery draws more customers into the city , from which the other businesses will benefit , fear the opponents , that then the pedestrian prec@@ inct . &quot;
&quot; added : the gallery is designed exactly on the property , on which the peasant hall is standing , in the 13 direct market market . &quot;
with the start of construction work will be finished .
the Galerie makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and to a Bed@@ a @-@ place finish with possibility of sitting outside .
Simone Zimmer : &quot; we &apos;ve been buying a week in the farmers market for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the cottages are always very happy . &quot;
also the but@@ cher we discovered for us .
&quot; we would like to see that during and above all , after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer . &quot;
in other cities there is also this .
&quot; above all , the small hall hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether there is direct market @-@ market in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the amount of rent . &quot;
&quot; however , this should not be very low in the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : what shopping Palace in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; clothes , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find that superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there are already enough of that in our city .
you can see how many cargo transactions are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but here , however , there is not even a decent weekly market , it is all the more important that we at least get the market hall . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered is fresh , is largely offered by the producer and is also inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , shop stores are reserved only by major companies in a shopping centre , because the dor@@ man@@ t are often not portable for a retailer . &quot;
&quot; too bad , specialty shops are almost no more and what is left of it , will probably also disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping center with a Mark@@ thalle fit for me not together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
especially : where is the farmers market place during the construction period ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even when the bit gallery will eventually occur .
or does it manage to sell all shops from Bit@@ burg before ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it will simply not work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which is empty , it also needs no one . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a peasant hall , it is thanks to the ins@@ cription many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg is no more space . &quot;
&quot; when the peasant hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
an appropriate similarity : artist creates portrait with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost invisible - that hanging from the ceiling by the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ers and Haar@@ lem which were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the earlier secret service Analy@@ st sent a 35 year @-@ year prison sentence , after she publicly made public messages over the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on 2nd of August , A Be@@ coming resem@@ blan@@ ce ( A suitable similarity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was consoli@@ dating its expertise in technology , computer sciences and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ wife and groundbreaking Dis@@ si@@ er , whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created by the algorithms analysis of DNA that could be extracted from Mann@@ ing , how someone with these genom@@ ic data could look like someone with these genom@@ ic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the in@@ dur@@ ente determin@@ ants of these interpre@@ tations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has spoken openly about identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , including six bre@@ aches of the sp@@ y Act , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; through the prison , her picture was sup@@ pressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gran@@ ate , black @-@ white sel@@ fish@@ y , in which Mann@@ ing is obviously sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and has a plat@@ former stri@@ pe - with which she was associated with . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of her 2012 @-@ project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
&quot; in that the artist portraits of strangers made of for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts like a cigarette stupid and che@@ wing g@@ um , adding the DNA out of the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look . &quot;
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg in a press show of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea , and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
the artist and her de@@ tain@@ ted m@@ use were gathered together in un@@ equal glasses that have received several letters during the course of two years .
&quot; they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated com@@ ic &quot; Sup@@ pressed Images , &quot; who would fores@@ ee a future in which the President chel@@ ated chel@@ ated judgment , and it would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ing release after seven years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome type of bl@@ iss@@ ful meeting . &quot;
&quot; there is even now at the opening of the exhibition a little bit far , and Star@@ ke , because Donald Tr@@ ump lead a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the governmental camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ aked ways that he actually should fix , continue to infl@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; as De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg after the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; &quot; things happen &quot; &quot; for a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; on the wall of the Galerie dated artistic statement called Mann@@ ing with its surviving signature , among them ( the &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; in their family name is provided with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose base is based on gender , race , sexuality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence , a thou@@ sand@@ al of Cs and Gs and As , in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped , to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed scientific dictionary , like amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in organic ways , we all are . &quot;
&quot; what people hopefully will take takes care of who we are and how openly genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , also to be seen . &quot;
DNA data can tell so many different stories so the 30 of these stories are .
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition is kept in one &apos;s own space , is a page from the above com@@ ic @-@ No@@ vel@@ le . &quot;
she shows men as she appears with a release @-@ release ef@@ on in his hand from the discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ kas@@ barracks of the United States like King @-@ Hong Kong .
&quot; when they stand up your speech , then they have won , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who greet him out of Philadelphia . &quot;
&quot; I still get da@@ wns , if I speak about it . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it should be fores@@ een in the com@@ ic book - but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , composed of their own genom@@ ic simul@@ ations , which together like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also focused , as everything was written in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , in which their genetic bu@@ cket @-@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd of crowds , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it feels like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement , which also hidden behind their liberation . &quot;
Professor of North@@ western and a cler@@ k of the University of Oxford because of kill@@ ings
&quot; a national union hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who were looking for a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injury . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warrant was issued for murder due to their alleged participation in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau , as the acts of the Court of Cook County . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau , 26 , after several stit@@ ches died . &quot;
one by the police authority of Chicago published mutual warning system states that the cor@@ pse was discovered on 27 July .
&quot; officials received a call , came to Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries of his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau was still explained at the place of action for dead , and det@@ ectives examine the stal@@ ks as murder , while the police are actively searching for the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
La@@ them has been an extraordinary professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president for university relationships , said in an e @-@ mail explanation that La@@ them must now be lau@@ ghing now and out of the subject of the North@@ western University camp@@ uses . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal matter which is examined by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ ans . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ person at the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that we are in contact with the police in the UK and willing to help the US investigation authorities in any way possible .
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were shocked and wanting that he imagined .
&quot; Chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have a vision of their location , and our efforts to loc@@ alise them , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the Building Manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building who had just received a mysterious tip that said that in apartment 10@@ 08 something happened .
the police described the scene as a very cruel one .
&quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , it is unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July . &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victims had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team from Grand Plaza released a statement to the inhabitants : &quot; the police currently works on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim , and explores a variety of moti@@ fs , including possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the W@@ ada Roadmap in the near future &quot; - the Russian Vice @-@ Ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
Russian Vice @-@ Ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not last long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a specific stage in meeting the criteria of the roadmap , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has received the right to plan and test in co @-@ operation with UK@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ ada story was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; declared Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the roadmap of W@@ ada to comply with the code which describes the criteria for the re@@ dress of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization .
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not have anything to concern about Russia &apos;s cause . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria listed in the above mentioned criteria however determine that the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the W@@ ada approved investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren , to publicly approve state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sport . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko : &quot; we carry out the study because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has broken down a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there was no government programmes , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ kos &apos;s words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly S@@ mir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales office R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day S@@ mir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , then added : &quot; we have repeatedly told that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; added S@@ mir@@ nov . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of the dop@@ ing sc@@ andal than by the W@@ ada on the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
&quot; however , it has been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; following a visit to the main building of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ ada @-@ General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di does not sell eggs more
this shared the corporate groups .
&quot; it is a pure precaution , it may be gone out from any health draw@@ backs , it says in the communication . &quot;
&quot; from now on , there are only eggs to be supplied to Al@@ di , which have been tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ o@@ ily Anti @-@ L@@ ola . &quot;
Al@@ di wants to make clarity and transparency in its customers .
start ups which will help your company to become the next u@@ ber
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure their luck in your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the surveys did not work .
&quot; answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
and even if you desp@@ ise anonym@@ ity , some workers did not mo@@ urn the trial . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce H@@ air Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has called people from outside to help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is best to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee &apos;s commitment , it allows companies to provide surveys , specific groups and demographic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ n allow the C @-@ Suite executives to handle and apply directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ Bit for the persecution of her health , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your company ? &quot; &quot; Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools is used by companies to measure their commitment . &quot;
&quot; saving , she said that she has gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in addition to sn@@ ap surveys and surveys from certain teams , it offers an heat @-@ map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low approval outcomes - so you can drill . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain , so you won &apos;t be the next u@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ ale since a former employee describes a blog post office where those who have spoken , were punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility . &quot;
&quot; the Global Governance , Regulation and Compliance industry could already have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion worth , according to the financial technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize the company , saw an asc@@ ending of interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the u@@ ber F@@ all in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; convertible has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
has recently signed up as a client .
&quot; as G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent companies send tailor @-@ made &quot; Pul@@ se &quot; &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot;
it also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that can report the employee &apos;s bad behavior .
&quot; and if the main business leader is involved , complaints direct to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the Reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that his associates is poorly treated or un@@ ethical , it can be a costly consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cott , employee fluctu@@ ation and law@@ suits , said Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has been used convertible for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; sooner if a cler@@ k wanted to report a problem , he or she had to submit a phone number or e @-@ mail for the company &apos;s central , a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often an intimi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good opportunity to follow the discomfort of the staff . &quot;
&quot; now that the company converter works , problems that were previously hidden by executives , who were previously hidden in offices in cities or states - like discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ wind practices - can be identified and addressed faster . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 degree view in the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano who leads the risk management Group from Ruby on . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment , legal disputes . &quot;
&quot; companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 after making the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; however , it lasted until the &quot; social media came to their right &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology for monitoring ethics , people used hope as a strategy &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both lin@@ t and convertible can provide your software as a service , and load companies with recurring fees for the use of their products . &quot;
&quot; it is a business model and an opportunity that will find the consent of Venture Capital Invest@@ ors , which both supported start @-@ ups . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ ts received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; won $ 10 million in November by Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners , and brought his entire financing to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing number of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees are expecting more than before . &quot;
the markets like Silicon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only .
the staff want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if men are happy to be in a company that their voices heard , and that the work you are doing is worth it , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience with Link@@ ed@@ In , which both convertible and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors achieve ren@@ ditions when their portfolio companies are well running . businesses are running well if employees are campa@@ igning and engaged .
&quot; when the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and use of employees , it &apos;s no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the administrator of a company does not take action .
&quot; in fact , if a company asks employees about your feedback , it may have an anticip@@ ation that changes is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change does not happen quickly enough , or not at all , this can breed dis@@ appointments and att@@ achments . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must have been ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting on Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company to rely on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you are not following employees ask yourself , &quot; &quot; Do you really listen to me ? &quot;
take care of it ?
&quot; and if you do not care about it , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who carries out monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem reports about G@@ lin@@ t , so saving . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustrated staff , she was able to organize new teams from the speed of decision @-@ making and quality of communication , capable of organising several teams in the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights on the employees , and it hopes that in a long run this leads to a better bond of workers in an industry that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose clients , you will lose your company . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for break@@ age
&quot; at 23 o &apos;clock , there is a lot of U@@ CL@@ A Foot@@ ball@@ ers on one side of the new exercise areas of the team at the campus . &quot;
some have moved their tri@@ p@@ ups and show the back full of sweat from the first day of training .
for a good part of the team these un@@ active minutes make a lunch break .
&quot; players who are inscri@@ bed on the summer cur@@ vy , will return after the three @-@ hour exercise to their audi@@ ts before they return the next morning at 6 : 30 o &apos;clock to the water@@ man Football Center . &quot;
&quot; that is for the guys the next three days a real Tre@@ t@@ mühle &quot; , &quot; said Br@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday was Tuesday . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players and they actually extended their days - at least until the finale on Friday .
&quot; therefore , the first three training of U@@ CL@@ A should begin at 19 : 15 in order to fulfill the already packed schedule of players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than a day , in which the brood moved to the beginning of the camp almost one week after the last season , and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood practical exercises . &quot;
they are supposed to hold over 18 exercises in the course of August . 20 before the formal playing preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude against Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he support the control change at N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add a different point to the players involved . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous load on three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pressed it down , they plac@@ ks on , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come up to Saturday and we have more time , it really will be great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practices , as soon as the camp is termin@@ ated , in view of the clear Si@@ enna fields of its fields from an adjoining parking lot and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that has already been rejected with foot@@ b@@ umps , which will be a protective net behind a door@@ posts . &quot;
&quot; brood @-@ players will occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a adm@@ its that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then set a exercise on it . &quot;
&quot; if you have the vide@@ ot@@ or of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces in parking 8 . &quot;
&quot; we will do the best , with what we have . &quot;
that is why I don &apos;t have too much worry about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensify facts @-@ check in the fight against counterf@@ eit news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to fac@@ t@@ apping audi@@ tor of third parties and show their findings under the original contribution , then the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News . &quot;
&quot; the company said in an opinion on his website , that it will begin with the use of updated machine methods to detect possible fal@@ cons and to send them to fac@@ t@@ apping audi@@ tor , displaying results of the billing test from the original article . &quot;
Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the major share points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News from which many believe that they also have influenced the U.S. presidential elections in 2016 .
&quot; the issue has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters over the presidential elections in May with false stories , and Germany will support a plan that can be punished for social media channels as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook was told in a separate statement in German that in the U.S. , France , the Netherlands and Germany will start a test of the new facts review . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the realization of what stories of fact @-@ tested parties are challenged , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product man@@ ag@@ ger for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature at the &quot; &quot; upcoming article &quot; &quot; and working on other changes to his news @-@ feed to decrease false news . &quot;
creating a com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a Squ@@ ee@@ ze Music video and was for Margaret T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ 0s and 1980 @-@ er a si@@ pf@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced a turbulent history of its cozy seat at the Be@@ wl River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes , a cosmopolitan of Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man , with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who is dead since 300 years , &quot; he says . &quot;
what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hands .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; surrounded the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , upcoming British artist - Isaac Len@@ kie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was un@@ expect@@ edly emotional . &quot;
&quot; I only responded to the thum@@ b button on the side of a letter , which has been written by a double @-@ agent in the 1700 @-@ s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; that is his thum@@ b pressure !
&quot; and letters always sm@@ elled by smoke , for at that time one de@@ formed a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself would be . &quot;
&quot; I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is struck so with old papers , he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I said my welcome boy a little over@@ valued &quot; ) , this all seems too beautiful to be true . &quot;
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle to explore the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the Mongo@@ lian heads on the walls and the bottles that have spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emigr@@ ated through the terrain and ruins of the old castle , and spoke with country@@ men , gar@@ den@@ ers , and sometimes also with artists who worked at the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received its full access in 2006 as the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey . &quot;
&quot; as Rhodes a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive that he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which aristocr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , Cast it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English emp@@ ires , cards , who , who possessed , &quot; you might think that land @-@ conflicts would be boring &quot; , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a pe@@ ar in order to have fought the two families . &quot;
guys , let everything go his gear ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse on the broader base in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves a man the newly built castle , to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a recording of a turmoil that came up at 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &quot; Kni@@ zes &quot; of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rhodes . &quot;
&quot; the farm arose in this area and I thought , an insurrection was a good start . &quot;
maybe the two are connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , who tells the history of the Jesu@@ it , who hid the family of Dar@@ rell seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell is depicted in the 18th century , who filled his own funeral , by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was only years later turned out when its coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed almost in@@ down to always do debt and spend money on things they could not afford .
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men prov@@ oked their debt crisis by keeping rich old women married , I imagine them as a pile of well @-@ looking boys , with a talent to advertise profitability . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his efforts at the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique write @-@ experiences . &quot;
&quot; he has brought a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about E@@ f@@ oo@@ ki@@ ki , the premises of a San@@ at@@ orio from the early 20th century , which has been re@@ claimed since then by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the dam@@ ned life . &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ en@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf covered
&quot; with the v@@ eiling of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ en@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honnef on Friday has started its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( with a short of Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; even until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team want to keep Nelson Ar@@ tz the logo and the slogan secret . &quot;
at the end of August there will be a celebration of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or , &quot; &quot; ask the creators of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think this ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write them on their late website . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some is better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that we as a Bad Honne@@ fer citizens are very likely to know about the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; in the action it is more than &quot; &quot; only &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it means further . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a single @-@ state promise , one that gives the city a unique selling point . &quot;
&quot; finally , she is standing in competition with other municipalities . &quot;
a medium @-@ digit amount will be the city of Bad Honnef its new roof brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan fear of the army
&quot; every year in early August , advis@@ es in Ankara the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) as reti@@ re and assistance in the officer cor@@ ps . &quot;
so also this week .
at first glance a normal process .
&quot; but nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces , a year after the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of Staff , as formerly , but in the Official office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the presidency of the Heads of State now the five Vice @-@ Ep@@ re@@ mi@@ ers and the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; thus , the civilians in the Y@@ as were in the prevalence . &quot;
the government moves the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; Chief Apostle Hul@@ us@@ i Ac@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of army , air forces and the nav@@ y were ab@@ used . &quot;
since the failed Cou@@ p President Erdo@@ gan in 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , Erdo@@ gan as a wire drawing of the coup . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 people , who are immediately involved in the attempt of coup , will be engaged in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; even the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the overthrow of &quot; &quot; divine gift &quot; &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to clean@@ se the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan the army really get a grip ?
&quot; at the end of February , the paper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article titled &quot; Un@@ si@@ gen in the military headquarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; generally , there are concerns for an increasing &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; of the army , which among other things manifest themselves in the lifting of the head@@ scar@@ f ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
the big pur@@ pos@@ ing with the army and the security guards goes on any way .
&quot; in the middle of July Erdo@@ gan , by decree , issued another 7@@ 3@@ 95 Staats@@ b@@ ans , among them 2@@ 303 poli@@ c@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan was t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als are formerly known as the actual men of the country .
three times they presented their appeal to their role as guardian of the mund@@ ane state of state .
&quot; after his election in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan took the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform@@ ists of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan &apos;s drive targeted a Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a named Officer , who sought after the coup attempt to seek asylum from persecution in foreign countries , the Turkish army will be in few years &quot; full of extremis@@ ts and Sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such a development could not make NATO cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , in the alliance after the inf@@ ant doubts , there is doubts about the deployment of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; said Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media . &quot;
&quot; he looks ahead to reduce the legal immigrants at 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining visa for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ payers , and will do so by changing the way the US will change the way citizens from other countries of green cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains of migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will come to candidates who will speak English , who have financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot;
ministry wants to track track for racing at an angle
&quot; over the past few months , over the future of the race will have been denied , it is supposed to go very quickly . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the year is said to be at the mar@@ ok circuit , on which the tourist train drives , built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the race climb in the long term , the road will begin to begin on the track according to the Department of Transport . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to order and san@@ ship the distance of Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country has become important for the tourism industry , &quot; stated Verkehrs@@ Under@@ secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the cost of the over@@ hau@@ ling of the track took about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the land assumed 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on whose basis the shuttle should be ordered in the future from the country , I am currently un@@ matched , explained S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the ministry and the South@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen &apos;s railway as a owner can already agree on technical details .
&quot; thus the roadmap , the vehicles used and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for eleven years .
thus the rac@@ g @-@ Shuttle on December 2017 will be reg@@ ained .
the racing cycle shuttle is a particular popular rail link between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; during the last months , in the course of a pilot operating company , the circuit has been used by sufficient many people to restore it in the future . &quot;
the track is also strong in parts very colorful .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought it cannot be more crazy , a new report about the technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , actually . &quot;
sex robots are currently a great thing .
recently published the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Rob@@ otik ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robot in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and Co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must begin to take her ascension seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye colour of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; people make themselves funny about them , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; Mr. Shar@@ key said at the release of his new report . &quot;
&quot; modern S@@ isters have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots , with a sili@@ cone , which feels warm to the touch of human reactions , which are achieved through artificial intelligence . &quot;
&quot; the user can adjust his robot according to his beliefs , &quot; and thereby selecting everything from the eye color of the robot above the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples up to the type or the color of its f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but there will be more disturbing , since many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford wife progressive . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed into robots with a sili@@ cone skin .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robots allows for example to adapt its users to the properties that find them appealing , such as relap@@ sing . &quot;
and then there is still the Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ robot with pre @-@ programmed personalities as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of relap@@ sing and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adventurous personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the site of true companion . &quot;
&quot; she likes what you like , and she does not like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
she also has her m@@ oods over the day - just like real people !
&quot; it can be tired , be fixed to conversation or it can be &quot; in mood . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the lowest female features , the swelling of rape , if one is a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : contradic@@ ting ) Far@@ rah , is a quiet one on most . &quot;
on his website the true companion Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy with a vibration but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then not have Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; it is said on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fairy or just another sex toys . &quot;
their formation and its increasing sophistic@@ ation point out a little darker and deeper into our culture to retreat from the ideal of equal rights of the sexes to a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core .
&quot; most men will of course take no sex robots , and while the FR@@ R appears their rising popularity , they still remain provisional on the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what perme@@ ates from the edge @-@ zones can be very instruc@@ tive in relation to the spirit of time , in which we live , very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until they have the free market for this .
&quot; there is however a certain over@@ l@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots are up at a time when the rights of women are threatened around the world , in which there is a president in the White House who has pra@@ ved women sexually attacked . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ terr@@ ent aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the rounded body and the extinct eyes , but how realistic this vision acts . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
the aim behind these sex robots is to establish a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( though with por@@ no@@ star @-@ proportions ) .
&quot; they want their inheritance to be human , they feel humane to the movement of a real body . &quot;
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots do not represent real women . &quot;
they can not separate yourself from their companion or just go away .
&quot; they have no placement or a background history , nothing that indicates in independence or anything , which could distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission . &quot;
otherwise expressed : they are counterf@@ eit@@ ful slaves .
or to express it in the phrases by 2017 : maid
Tr@@ umps big performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney a by@@ word of the sound mind
&quot; it has become a di@@ sen@@ weis@@ ness of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era , that political divisions that pol@@ arized the US @-@ vote , also divided families in the small @-@ format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ le , there were newspapers with advice on how to cope with the horror of dre@@ ary relative relatives . &quot;
we are all allegedly committed to burst our filter bub@@ bles .
&quot; less noticed is the power of m@@ umps , families together . &quot;
&quot; I chose this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist seal that lives in Chicago and has long been dealing with the Re@@ public@@ ans in our family , who visited me this week in New York . &quot;
they reminded me that unity can have a powerful enemy against a common enemy .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House is everyone who knows them , including the Republi@@ can Relation@@ ship , with whom she fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite odd on the same page . &quot;
&quot; for the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it also coinci@@ des with a wider context that this also brings significant risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the deto@@ xi@@ fying effect of his presidency has the power to push all of us to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ ace@@ ful possibility that we will no longer cope with a day . &quot;
&quot; but there is still another long @-@ term long @-@ term scenario , in which Tr@@ ump Re@@ public@@ ans of the Right W@@ ing &quot; norm@@ alizes , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as a sense of denial . &quot;
&quot; I find myself nowadays from an active No@@ stal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ ging version of the d@@ apper , who saw 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return ) - both in fact a very mild criminal off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can must be only intellectu@@ ally healthy to qualify as im@@ measurable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousine was in town , we brought our children to car@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ uss@@ ells in the New York parking department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city , if you don &apos;t need caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all clo@@ wns are scarce and the animals revol@@ ve to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and climatic music conve@@ ys this in a strange manner . &quot;
&quot; so many Kl@@ is@@ che@@ es of a city will appoint : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are becoming familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not across the day , when I found that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage , the topics pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience , as here two two @-@ year @-@ old , one 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have reviewed the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him full scores , but fortunately no one asked about it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was obliged to rate my &quot; &quot; experience &quot; &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before using my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to get the rating with a 15 % drinking money - this in order to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this leads not only to a slo@@ wing of what should be a neutral exchange , but is also exer@@ ting pressure on the server to bring the personality in a situation where none is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor wife in the department store was ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tic gr@@ ins@@ ing , while I got tired of experience to reach my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ing@@ us with chest pain from prison in the hospital
p@@ istol for the second time left the prison for a hospital visit .
&quot; last year , he was transferred to hospital because of the treatment of cuts to his wr@@ ists who suffered the prison authorities after a case in his cell . &quot;
p@@ istol was sentenced to a first aid pro@@ secut@@ ors due to murder in response to an appeal to the pro@@ secut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ en@@ kam@@ p in the early morning of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by removing them several times by a door of the toilet cabins in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria on her .
&quot; Pist@@ p@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a ni@@ ghtly intru@@ der , hidden in c@@ ab . &quot;
&quot; the pro@@ secut@@ ors have announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of pist@@ ori@@ us appeal , from which they say , they be too len@@ i@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; the National Criminal Tribunal said that they will raise the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year . &quot;
&quot; Pist@@ ing@@ us is risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years , if the pro@@ secut@@ ors are successful . &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as Bauer Arnold takes a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools the neighborhoods from F@@ oters and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were dischar@@ ged into the holidays and into the leading schools .
three of the intimi@@ dation go to the g@@ ymnasium , four to the real school . &quot;
school@@ ing Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te greeted the parents and representatives of the public in the civil war Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen on Tuesday evening .
&quot; as a symbol for school dis@@ mis@@ sal , the 29 students of the four classes in the direction of Sophia Schu@@ macher and Reg@@ ine Meder chose a young eagle who grows in chicken breast , but then release into freedom . &quot;
&quot; to this end the m@@ under@@ e Sch@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the chicken case . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Martin Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to bro@@ w it from his chicken . &quot;
instead of a chicken stock a little eagle came out .
&quot; but the hope to make out of it a chicken , the eagle spread out on a high mountain his wings , and escaped . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the course of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken . &quot;
&quot; the hen danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinder bore to the bet . &quot;
&quot; the eagle stand for the integration , said Schul@@ er Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the young is different from the other young animals ( chi@@ cks ) , but belong to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
they wished each four @-@ pi@@ anos that he feels in his new school .
&quot; it was followed by acceptance of the colleagues , the former school@@ manager Michael Müller , who has always jumping again in teaching courses , and the parents representatives . &quot;
the car@@ ess season is now over and explained class instruc@@ tors Sophia Schu@@ macher .
&quot; she abandoned her students after two years of lessons very much , because it had been a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they have been able to rely on the neighborhoods . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students got a song of summer time and holiday season . &quot;
it was great pleasure with the children .
for the new school year eight first @-@ ke@@ epers are already registered .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned because of illegal camps in Greece , divided the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quotes by television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of 1 August , Si@@ th@@ onia was arrested by a group of illegal people arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
the same day they were released while an investigation is currently running .
the State Department reported b@@ TV that the Bul@@ gar@@ en were released later .
&quot; the Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated the control of the free camps and place anyone who is found to remain in a place which is not intended for this purpose , considerable fin@@ es . &quot;

the ministry said that the court can impose a penalty .
software update for diesel cars : what the people now need to know
how accurate does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the diesel @-@ top , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
they should improve the emission @-@ behavior of cars of the emissions classes Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are exemp@@ t .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from the ACE car Club Europa are assessments :
is the new action obligatory ?
&quot; no , the tra@@ ded software updates are optional . &quot;
&quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles , which are che@@ ating software , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
the retro@@ fit has arranged the plant @-@ state @-@ Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced a fast implementation in the coming months , but not yet known as an exact date . &quot;
Daimler has communicated to write every person concerned .
&quot; if there is any inspection , it will be done in their context . &quot;
how long should the retro@@ fit be drawn up altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
this depends on the commitment of the producers as well as political pressure .
because we have seen and volunte@@ ered the car manufacturers on the subject of the environment so far .
how long should the update last ?
the re@@ armament itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming it could be to get an appointment .
&quot; what drivers do you want to drive from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE is waiting for wait .
&quot; most likely , foreign manufacturers would be re@@ drawn , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
is now a massive price drop of Euro @-@ 4 @-@ cars ?
the ACE feared this .
&quot; but even in the regions , where roads threaten . &quot;
in the rural area there are no value loss for older diesel until now .
the ACE is waiting to wait with a sales still .

we make the city li@@ vable
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , continues in the coming year in R@@ ent . &quot;
the place is already written - suitable applicants are rare .
for 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been .
and work is still enjoying great fun as he conve@@ ys in the press discussion .
&quot; he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks , which are waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , you wondered , that so far no application has added the application profile . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the next time .
this is to be done - taking into account the regular termin@@ ations - still enough time for a review .
&quot; as Has@@ l@@ ach acts for the administrative community as a sub@@ ordin@@ ance agency , the applicant must assign appropriate degrees . &quot;
because this feature wants to keep the city definitely .
&quot; if they no longer need to render them out , the citizens would have to travel to Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but it is important to the city and itself , says W@@ acker , who tells of a good working atmosphere , as well as a good mood between the authority and the citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated to look back to the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city li@@ vable , &quot; he is safe about the ministry and his staff . &quot;
&quot; but even in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the low @-@ car park are around . &quot;
&quot; the kin@@ d@@ bridge between B@@ oll@@ en@@ bach and Stein@@ ach will be renewed , even the stage of stadium is still subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter alone will strike some 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; If we make it right , &quot; appreci@@ ates W@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; design , too , for a city @-@ master of great scope . &quot;
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own construction yard and gar@@ dener was quite flexible to react very flexi@@ bly .
&quot; one can move a lot , &quot; W@@ acker , and the design of the founders will often be mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town as an ensemble stands under monument protection , it is important to have an eye for what rein@@ car@@ ded , &quot; &quot; when new buildings are approved , the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the city master . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the construction master bears high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is Bau@@ herr , &quot; in the end everything is running here above my table . &quot;
with care and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ maier ( super@@ structure ) has been here for ten years with Manfred Schön@@ er ( deep @-@ building ) for 15 years .
&quot; also that his successor will stay long , W@@ acker : &quot; we seek someone who really can really identify and stay with the job . &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working environment but also for the further development of the city .
&quot; who wants to be@@ get Roland W@@ acker , should register for information from the city of Has@@ l@@ ach , as a diploma @-@ engineer or Bachelor with specialized architecture , and have good expertise in the fields of construction and construction planning . &quot;
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt are high @-@ and low @-@ construction , construction @-@ management , management of urban properties , urban facilities , municipal court and municipal property , including thinking protection . &quot;
cycle on lines throw : southern track locked
&quot; according to the police , the unknown perpetr@@ ator had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway crossing into the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the leader@@ ships . &quot;
they were so severely damaged that the approaching freight @-@ train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetrators and are looking for night time after them .
near the scene the witnesses had been observed by witnesses a pink Rol@@ ler@@ - and a bike @-@ driver .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ ehl , &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to APA . &quot;
the or the offen@@ ders had brought himself in great danger and also threatens the train traffic .
&quot; in addition to the damage at the Lo@@ k and the plant , as well as the long @-@ hour drive and the cost of shipping traffic , the railway @-@ customers might also come to the cul@@ pr@@ its . &quot;
&quot; overall , by a &quot; significant &quot; sum , the speaker said . &quot;
the damage was fixed on Friday afternoon and the rail traffic on the south @-@ route could be led without disability .
&quot; almost ten persons were taken on Friday , two of them considered the road transport . &quot;
&quot; Gü@@ ter@@ ings did not fell out , but they had delay . &quot;
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged approximately 200 meters above lines .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( In@@ fl@@ amed intestinal disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare .
&quot; but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in flesh @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could rel@@ ieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition in the USA affects approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 300@@ ,000 , causing stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhea , loss of weight and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; during the sufferers usually get rid of meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Washingtoner University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han contribute to developing immune cells to promote a tolerant intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; leading researchers , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immun@@ os@@ c@@ els in the intest@@ ine pat@@ rol to make sure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide themselves in eating , do not penetrate into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are able to resolve inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging tissue . &quot;
if the balance is too far towards inflammation tends to result from a inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
experiments was found that a kind of tolerance conve@@ ying immune cell on mice occurs to carry a particular bacter@@ ium in their initi@@ ators .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the gem@@ s of proteins to trigger the appearance of cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a link between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice in their food the more they had of these immune cells .
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an on tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was promoting a rich , lesser inflammatory bo@@ wel disease , if the same system is also with people . &quot;
&quot; the post@@ doctoral fellow in Dr. Luisa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan studied a kind of immune cell that encourages tolerance , as it found out that a group of study forces had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was not separated . &quot;
&quot; they suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal micro@@ bial of the mice , the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi , who normally live in the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ är@@ me of mice were found DNA sequ@@ en@@ ia , and there were six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells , but without them lacking in mice . &quot;
mice were raised in an steri@@ le setting so that they were missing an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop these types of immune cells and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cell .
to understand how the bacteria out to the immune system they left L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a fluid and then transmitted little amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells that were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed to the tolerant cells .
&quot; the active component of the liquid has been cleaned , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ Met@@ abol@@ ism , known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 mil@@ actic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers de@@ double the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in feed the mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ ic@@ t have hal@@ ved , the number of cells sank around half . &quot;
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan is stated that people have the same tolerant cells like mice and that most of us reu@@ ter@@ i protect us in our gast@@ ro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in people as they do with mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ inflammatory bo@@ iling . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ uses can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; at Manchester United has signed a &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , &quot; believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening his debut at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pounds of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday and impres@@ sing in the Hal@@ ter &apos;s role as people like Paul Po@@ g@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira for popularity . &quot;
&quot; MA@@ TIC was however excluded from the Pre@@ par@@ ation Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had to improve , that he had to improve the Premier League season prior to the start of the Premier League . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him to be ready earlier than later .
&quot; besides mixing also Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in Avi@@ va Stadium , as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho did not wish three further new commitments , but he ins@@ isted that the club has already done a &quot; fantastic job , &quot; three of his four priority will be fulfilled . &quot;
&quot; three of four , I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happier if they get four out of four , but they have given great trouble . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; pilots flew from Seattle in U.S. state Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan and moved to the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers over the US , which are several thousand kilometres . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar beam the shape of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be .
the whole was a thum@@ b for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing @-@ logo was painted in the sky .
&quot; new bur@@ ial for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; just as the wind revol@@ ves , as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD chief , looked at S &amp; D &apos;s Prime Minister before elections to be a certain concern over Berlin . &quot;
&quot; merely no stor@@ er@@ fire from the party central , merely no counter@@ wind from the covenant - this was the most important wish of the electoral campa@@ ig@@ ners . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , the fundamental change has changed . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from the Willy Brandt @-@ Brandt observe the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals . &quot;
&quot; what Mr Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , it would not be described with head@@ winds . &quot;
it was low @-@ set@@ backs .
and one after another .
&quot; according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the new @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Greens . &quot;
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green simply cannot rule reliably , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising fac@@ tional part of a Green Group has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a difficult crisis .
five months before the Sunday elections his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote @-@ majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ federal business@@ man Michael Kellner asked the ab@@ omin@@ ous Nieder@@ säch@@ s@@ ische Green @-@ MEP El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to return their mandate .
the crossing to the CD@@ U is a clear rejection of the elec@@ torate .
El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests must immediately return their mandate &quot; said the Federal Bureau and electoral campa@@ igning of the Greens to the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; this must not all be true , &quot; &quot; an SPD electoral campa@@ ig@@ ners , as on Friday afternoon , the new hi@@ obs@@ essed message has reached the Party central . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Nieder@@ sachsen , stands for the crossing of the green Members El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to CD@@ U without their own governmental majority . &quot;
it is the temporary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD associations .
and no one knows what is coming next .
the misery began with the un@@ expect@@ edly dimin@@ ishing defeat at the Saarland election in March .
&quot; blue eye , more not , re@@ ass@@ uring the comrades of his time . &quot;
after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia everything will be different .
that was then - and it &apos;s all much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel , the SPD led to the ge@@ d@@ ge@@ ons , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite colon@@ el , and the party smoothly . &quot;
&quot; pain@@ stak@@ ingly r@@ app@@ alled the comrades again in the weeks afterwards . &quot;
&quot; then , when they had just got new courage , the G @-@ 20 top came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him came the next deep @-@ mount .
&quot; Mayor of O@@ la@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD @-@ chief , lost his Nim@@ bus during this weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city burned . &quot;
and because in crisis communication it &apos;s pretty much everything you can do wrong .
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z is fighting for its political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; due to the VW bure@@ tor and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Nieder@@ säch@@ s@@ ische Prime Minister has already been critic@@ ised in criticism . &quot;
mi@@ esis was added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely , Wei@@ l tried to get stronger in the last weeks to put into the covenant acc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the former mayor of Hanover , his power in Berlin , also remained hidden in the surroundings of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they left him because she spoke of Wei@@ l a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could happen .
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l meets the party &apos;s internal constraints , the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Greens do not have to blame . &quot;
and Schulz were not at all .
at times the comrades try to keep their own ranks .
&quot; your anger is directed towards the Greens , and here above all to the slo@@ wing parliament@@ arians &apos; v@@ ests . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ arable and democratic , such as Mrs. T@@ v@@ ests presents their own careers over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , chief of the Party left in the SPD of the German Bundestag , the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ v@@ ests is not elected to parliament because of her person as a direct candidate , but on the state list of the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Greens , such as the Nieder@@ säch@@ s@@ ische MEP . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , leader of the SPD of the German Bundestag , compl@@ ained a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vote against four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Wei@@ l to Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Nieder@@ säch@@ s@@ ische SPD as a leading candidate in the election election , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career character@@ ization of a future CD@@ U parliament@@ arians said the election result , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann continued . &quot;
he urged to clear the background .
I want to know if there has been more or more out@@ going commitments of the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding for Ort@@ sk@@ ern III
those who want to live in the old house can soon get support from the country .
&quot; in addition , the Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representative St@@ eg Stadt@@ Development on Wednesday in received . &quot;
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler gave again a review of what happened so far .
&quot; since 1991 , there are in fragile re@@ development areas . &quot;
&quot; at that time , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the State of Baden @-@ Württemberg has still taken over two thirds of the funding . &quot;
&quot; in the refurb@@ ishment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler the previous san@@ itation are a &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; - it is important to promote the interior development , and not just tap new building areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , at the end of April we have received the information from the Federal President of Karlsruhe , that there will be a san@@ itation area III . &quot;
&quot; the funding amount was 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which came more than 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the assembly . &quot;
how is a re@@ development ?
&quot; one will continue to examine so Sch@@ in@@ dler , examine where the &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; but it also plays a role , whether in the planned area at all interest , to san@@ ship . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the regional representative could then move again . &quot;
&quot; the jet@@ ty appeared on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; cellar presented the contents of the federal states &quot; &quot; Social Town , &quot; which would then be carried out in the framework of the re@@ organization . &quot;
&quot; core of the program is to rev@@ itali@@ zation of internal cities , improving the living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be subject to object @-@ related , that is said per plot . &quot;
the re@@ organisation would then finally be defined as stat@@ ute .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation period has been exp@@ elled since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2017 .
&quot; even until September of this year , however , the inventory would only be carried out once more , within the framework of those involved in the re@@ organisation involved a questionnaire to fill out . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the pro@@ filing date should be made possible , so that in the coming year we can start with the renov@@ ations . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann stated that each Comm@@ une had to perform the said alleg@@ ations .
&quot; it is about to evaluate and decide the city &apos;s mis@@ conception , and decide when sanc@@ tioned and to what extent . &quot;
it will then also be registered for the respective property as well as a san@@ itation in the basic book .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again , and get a picture of the situation , she spoke . &quot;
Got@@ zel stressed : an essential success factor for the project is the participation of those involved .
&quot; therefore , questionn@@ aires will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out by the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; building and land @-@ bow &quot; &quot; in which it is among other things to view the structural state and the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; household and housing &quot; , &quot; can be made up to size , distribution and residents of a residential area . &quot;
the blue &quot; operating bow &quot; can only be filled out when operated in the building business areas .
&quot; however , in mind , Got@@ zel showed that a reduced questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new measures are not eligible . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler also stressed that the distribution of funding according to the &quot; &quot; Wind@@ dog principle &quot; &quot; work - who comes first , ad@@ mon@@ ish it first . &quot;
&quot; we could not reserve the funding &quot; &quot; for later &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in conclusion , pictures of the project &quot; &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II &quot; &quot; was shown to make the present a rest@@ aur@@ ation . &quot;
British inventor places himself a micro@@ chip to get into house and car with a hand@@ shake
&quot; a bri@@ tish inventor is the first in the country , who is equipped with a micro@@ chip so that he can open his door , enter its office and even start his car . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and for@@ ef@@ inger and now provides the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify life with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory consultant at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out to medical standard . &quot;
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr North@@ - also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now built both at home and in his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the advertising costs of the White House will cost tax@@ payers thousands
&quot; the decision of the White House , a nav@@ y helicopter to fly for an event that highlights the American production in the last month , tax@@ payers have been left to the military to the TI@@ ME magazine up to $ 24@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky v@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programmes . &quot;
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Chief Executive Officer of the White House made a tour of products of all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter @-@ made helicopter was exhibited in addition to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ man car from Wisconsin and a for@@ k@@ lift from Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; the military office of the White House required the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or F@@ RA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter ride to the South La@@ wn , according to the records of Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted to know that you are aware of it , because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superi@@ ors , the deputy naval company for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helicopter took place on July 17th against 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15@@ pm , and so long stayed until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 . &quot;
&quot; the note adds that if the departure from the White House would be delayed , due to the limitation of service hours a second team would be required for return flight . &quot;
&quot; the original flight capacity was during the event during the helicopter , while the security personnel were during the period during the time on the plane . &quot;
&quot; the recordings provided by the TI@@ ME were not clear , whether in the end a second flight statement was required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act has federal government to use public ownership for political purposes .
data sets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could violate the destination .
&quot; a question we asked , was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are closed , &quot; the deputy commander . &quot;
&quot; the event &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot;
but official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the President gave an impetus for the reform of the health reform that was in progress in the Senate , and he ass@@ ures the efforts to susp@@ end government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the airplane , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
presidents are oblig@@ ated to use them for the journey .
&quot; however , to request their use only for a photo @-@ OP is unusual . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump led a study in February when the plane &apos;s plane was shot in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about using the Presidential aircraft by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lin@@ d@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 occup@@ ations often lead training trips around Washington and South La@@ wn to set out the U.S. President in the White House with precise centimeters .
&quot; as a Tr@@ ump in early July at the G20 , in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led in the White House 58 exercise centers . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event rests with the training needs of the flight travel for the month , said an official . &quot;
&quot; Heli@@ kop@@ ter @-@ units flew in addition 11 hours to this day for &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ payers were not the burden for any of the other re@@ qu@@ ites that were presented at the event .
&quot; a spokes@@ man from Si@@ kor@@ sky said , the company was not involved in getting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget desig@@ nations for the Presidential flights and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
&quot; according to the Stand@@ ing of the U.S. Defense Department for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D Re@@ venue for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is however 24.@@ 380 USD per flight . &quot;
records of the unit notice the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Cor@@ ps Air Facility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of running the helicopter reaches far below this rate .
&quot; the tax@@ payers &apos; costs on the basis of estimates for the annual turnover is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funding . &quot;
&quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 the revenue rates for DO@@ D does not include staff costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former press secretary of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ello , the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things this week , which are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ as . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the federal state Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
&quot; and I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for whom many Americans have worked tirel@@ ess@@ ly . &quot;
it is of course adequate to be emphasized .
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter , when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ man . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and spoke with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss will meet tomorrow from 11@@ am in Kiel on the table @-@ table Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
&quot; despite the five games still un@@ stable , the leader of the second tennis Bundesliga has received the sense of reality . &quot;
team @-@ chief Mari@@ us Z@@ ay certainly has respect for the opponent .
this is a compact team that is always playing in rather similar formation .

for the class and stability of the S@@ V @-@ dor@@ fer S@@ V especially the imports from the high north are concerned .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to bets at the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are also strong in the double &quot; , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Sweden ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ör@@ en and Es@@ king O@@ read , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen , as well as Andreas Bj@@ ör@@ hus ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; it will be as always hard for us .
&quot; you also need a good , lucky . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ her team for the trip to the high north is practical .

how America can harm the O@@ MV
&quot; really happy , Donald Tr@@ ump did not , when he placed his signature in the law on the shar@@ pen@@ ing of sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; in his hands , the law en@@ acted , the Congress adopted a few &quot; &quot; constitutional regulations &quot; &quot; . &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels exp@@ elled against the US . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft faces to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors from domestic O@@ MV have been troubled , which co @-@ financed with other European companies to build the construction of the Russian Eastern Car@@ rier . &quot;
the dr@@ yers is tremendous .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an assessment of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil corporation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump even would have to aw@@ aken the sanctions by an executive order to life . &quot;
twelve weapons are entitled to him .

roll back@@ wards : the city provides 46 kitchens
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ noon table itself again .
with firm contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the city &apos;s day@@ care centres the clock is revers@@ ed .
&quot; on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over again in the urban care centres ( Kit@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ um , deputy chief of youth aid , this is good news : &quot; we are all very pleased . &quot;
&quot; cooked in addition , out of house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh air @-@ cool@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the city operates in the Kre@@ feld area 46 kinder@@ garten , in 44 children get the children at lun@@ ch@@ time a warm meal . &quot;
&quot; in the past Kit@@ a@@ Year , there were 2@@ 800 children each of them at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , not only children who are served by 45 week@@ days are served in the K@@ ita , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour reception , if children remain until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot;
&quot; 46 sub@@ mar@@ es were starting from 1 September kitchen service : they ra@@ ving the fresh food , they supplement the salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individually , give the food off , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are firmly assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
the size - there are two group@@ ed as well as seventy @-@ groups - decide on the hour &apos;s wa@@ its .
&quot; the chef now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; so they are much more integrated , and it is easier to implement educational concepts . &quot;
because that &apos;s why it is about healthy food and cooking lessons .
the children should help to prepare the food .
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them and not ever @-@ changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the inf@@ estation of the K@@ ita @-@ spaces - previously also the task of the kitchen staff - will in future be done by a special cleaning personnel .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , apart from the quality improvement of the kitchen , also the charm that it turned out in cost between self @-@ regulated and foreigners for the city as the most economical way , it says from the press . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 sub @-@ time forces will be re@@ adjusted . &quot;
&quot; but these hours fall at approximately 750 people in the field of education at all not so strong in weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women who says the UN
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ som , official leader of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women are elected in the provinces of the provinces . three women are eligible for the role of vice @-@ president and over 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be representative and credible when women participate fully and be included in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections held on April 5th .
the Taliban have published threats against a election process which coinci@@ des with the transition from international warfare to an advisory role .
this year the elections for the first time will be peace@@ fully handed over by a democratically elected government .
Hay@@ som said : a strong role for women will intensify the democratic success of Afghanistan .
&quot; the Afgh@@ an independent electoral Commission reports that 1,2 million women are registered in a total of registered 3,@@ 6 million voters . &quot;

&quot; according to information on police , the men talked to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who held up with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , at 14.@@ 55 pm , because they wanted to telephone with the phone of the girl . &quot;

GM@@ B @-@ concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
a trade union would like to rely on the long @-@ term commitment to production in their work in Glasgow .
GM@@ B Scotland said the company was silent about the future of investments in the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the factory , besides other products hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea cookies . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Vic@@ ties , Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot;
he added that employees and trade union representatives were &quot; first experienced &quot; if their activities were to change .
&quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s alle@@ d@@ ders ( GM@@ B ) called &quot; &quot; GM@@ B Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s to express &quot; &quot; concern that funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be promoted . &quot;
&quot; GM@@ B @-@ senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we can win no clarity about the needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , concerns our members . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers firmly concentrate on the local community and the Greater Region , a key pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social discrimination . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ xit , the rising of life costs and the chronic production process , the east@@ er@@ ly end of Glasgow urgently need a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ p@@ ites at T@@ oll@@ cross did not get a letter from GM@@ B Scotland only yesterday , and the company will respond directly to our employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and GM@@ B representatives in T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that we work like all companies , who are active in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic environment , our business is constantly checked - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to be competitive . &quot;
&quot; added : &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site . if our operations , employees and trade union representatives should be the first to experience this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years before Ne@@ ym@@ ar ?
the side of La League likes to rep@@ ented their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain is not allowed to dis@@ sec@@ ede from Ne@@ ym@@ ar after offering an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to redeem its free@@ wheel cl@@ au@@ sel , but have warned them before the World War in Barcelona 3 years ago ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world ch@@ ord for more than the double of the previous brand , whereby Paul Po@@ g@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after ending , Ne@@ ym@@ ar is becoming the most expensive player in the world and for the highest paid professional sports@@ men of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GB@@ P a week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry about the way Ne@@ ym@@ ar has forced its way to outside , although a source located near the Catal@@ ans Executive Board , that the club has always given its best to care for him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G President before this prospect ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every association , who wanted to sign the top player from PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried , because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact her players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players in their sign , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , with the Spanish association in the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G clearly did that they wouldn &apos;t allow the International from Italy , under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for Ne@@ ym@@ ar . &quot;
sco@@ oter and damaged
&quot; during the night of Friday on Saturday a unknown perpetr@@ ator has thrown one in the royal fields street prior to the estate number 30 ab@@ ov@@ ens sco@@ oter , and so on the dis@@ guise of the vehicle Sach@@ damages from over 200 euros . &quot;

&quot; because he got a car on his side track , the driver had to so@@ ak the driver of a VW Tour@@ an , and tou@@ ched tou@@ red with it . &quot;
on Thursday night the 34 @-@ year @-@ old was from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um with his VW at 19.@@ 55 pm on the B 215 for Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese .
&quot; in the area of the town centre of Stol@@ zen@@ au , he was approaching a car on his side , so that he had to ev@@ ade himself to the right . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the Tour@@ an @-@ driver tou@@ ted the Lad@@ plann@@ ers . &quot;
at the passenger it was caused to damage .
&quot; the driver of the opposite passenger , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ hau@@ led a truck and continued his ride without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; according to the accident , it can be good according to the accident that the res@@ cu@@ ers had not noticed the accident at all . &quot;
&quot; the police , therefore , ask for the first @-@ time witness to the accus@@ ation as well as the driver of the caus@@ ation , to connect to Stol@@ len in Tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 with the commission@@ er in Stol@@ zen@@ au . &quot;
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen report drafted pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger
the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen report on the abuse of abuse of Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means the author and historian Michael H@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ sive sc@@ andal over the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen provides further discussions on discussions .
&quot; Christian Weis@@ sing , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are church , &quot; stated after publication against the German press agency , he , by the former Rain@@ y Bishop and today Cardinal Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , an excuse . &quot;
&quot; it would be very grateful to the prestige of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their profound ignorance about their own om@@ issions or at that time incorrect assessment of processes . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; are critici@@ zed that in the reporting of violence at the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen will be measured with &quot; two levels &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; regarding the assault in Regensburg , nobody knows that it would have to be prevented by &quot; sham@@ anic and sh@@ ame@@ ful acts that would be punished and be prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree medi@@ al manipulation , &quot; says the author Lu@@ c@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian , and member of the national Italian bio@@ eth@@ ic Committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of design@@ ate the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of the All @-@ day experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal for normal &quot; , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; we are happy to go to the church , and this is a couple of fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in addition , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; Tem@@ ge &quot; &quot; been a quite normal pedago@@ gical means &quot; &quot; to be done with friends , as I was one . &quot;
it &apos;s unfair to use today &apos;s standards in previous decades because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports of the dis@@ abuse there is often the Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; wron@@ gly , says author and historian Michael H@@ emann , who spoke with R@@ atz@@ inger the reminder &quot; &quot; My brother of pop@@ e &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I need to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; says Ez@@ emann , &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; he adds to the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the University of Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment attorney Ulrich Weber submitted ?
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , &quot; with high platinum &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 dom@@ ic@@ at@@ zen sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in summary report about Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 , so that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. has been applied in many cases forms of physical and psych@@ ic violence . &quot;
&quot; especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also be disastrous . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , contrary to numerous other accus@@ ations , many victims suffered the general Hum@@ anity of R. , and therefore in numerous cases despite violence even associate positive memories with it . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , H@@ emann , why the final report on the abuse of abuse in the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger expressed his opinion in his opinion . &quot;
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ Pages report on the &quot; incidents of violence perpetr@@ ated by the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen &quot; gives a conflic@@ ting picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; for one lift , many students highlight his &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as chol@@ ics and perfec@@ tionist who became tangible , when a domain name was musi@@ cally not a top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate as his bi@@ ograp@@ her this final report ?
&quot; Michael H@@ emann : when you are doing the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front until the rear , one has to wonder why the name of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger does not exist at all . &quot;
he has just returned eight pages and he is clearly spoken of any suspicion of abuse or co @-@ knowledge in the terrible cases sexual abuse .
&quot; also , the acts of violence at the pre @-@ school , found themselves outside its efficiency . &quot;
&quot; one can throw at it at all , to experience too late or have not taken the first hint seriously . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ing school on which he worked , was perceived by practically all respondents considered - so literally - &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thus , the vast majority of his pupils Georg R@@ atz@@ inger makes a quite excellent testimony , &quot; &quot; sincerely , &quot; &quot; sincerely , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; understanding &quot; , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teachers who put the guys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and bon@@ bons and &quot; always &quot; of the grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ained about his perfec@@ tionist and his high emotion@@ ality , which also led to deser@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; that he did not only crack with chairs and put the key@@ hole on the ground , but also ear@@ chers and too fre@@ eing guys pulled in hair or ears , he has already given years ago , deeply regret and apologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; salvation has to be said however , that such education methods were widespread in the questionable time , the 1960s and 1970s , widely used , with parents as with teachers . &quot;
do you also know such bre@@ eder methods ?
&quot; of course , I think of each of us who was born in 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a secular school , a state g@@ ymnasium . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually in this report , namely the irre@@ plac@@ eable sexual abuse and the violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , these are certainly dre@@ d@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; you wonder whether it is not more familiar with his acquain@@ tance and role as the brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media just threw upon him . &quot;
&quot; at the Bav@@ arian pop@@ e , many who have never understood him , are still eager . &quot;
the truth is : the report gathered Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in connection with the report , the report was very much reported on the subject of abuse at the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen . &quot;
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the Final report also laid out any involvement or co @-@ knowledge in relation to sexual abuse ?
Michael H@@ emann : quite clearly no .
no only of 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claimed to have become familiar to the dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; I was never dar@@ ed to speak with my father or mother over it , &quot; &quot; said an itch substitute for the others , &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot;
&quot; the real problem of educ@@ ating sexual abuse was and is , however , that most of the victims are silent . &quot;
&quot; if they were not even parents and si@@ blings , then certainly not a choir manager , who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators as a colleague . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen students R@@ atz@@ inger role in regard to the abuse of abuse ?
Michael H@@ emann : a surve@@ yed student form it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no means in what he would have had ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) could have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective cul@@ pr@@ it .
&quot; I think it ... also for really absurd to suppose that all of it ... be@@ eing more pressing or clearer , or more likely to have opened as compared to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ ories , trust instruc@@ tors etc . &quot;
that one speaks to him about sex ... - un@@ thin@@ kable . &quot;
&quot; the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; that in advance , students and / or their environment were entrusted , could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free of charge . &quot;
&quot; thus , it cannot be thrown to him not to prevent or have brought him to the ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore there is no reason to associate its good name with these contradic@@ tory crimes , as unfortunately in some cases it happened . &quot;
in the media was a lot of &quot; violence &quot; at the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was thrown down in the report . &quot;
must he live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael H@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the coverage everything was mixed and ming@@ led to a giant mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; however , this is in turn is a misuse of the report . &quot;
&quot; namely , it is clean : between the pre @-@ school and the grammar school of the cathedral , between sexual abuse and violence , as well as , let &apos;s say once , other alleg@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , so also for four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a choir leader . &quot;
&quot; the whole terrible test of the pedago@@ gy , the cases , in which l@@ ad from sa@@ di@@ st teachers were down@@ right and mal@@ ate , and they were all accepted , event@@ ful all at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to prevail . &quot;
&quot; but with whom , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister had nothing to do , because he got the boy to face , when they were already on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ing school . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , like most witnesses acc@@ entu@@ ate , the theme of &quot; &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; &quot; t@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
it was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; states .
what was different on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ing school ?
Michael H@@ emann : since there was discipline already discipline but do not have sa@@ di@@ st violence .
&quot; this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims are estim@@ ating the general humanity of R. , and therefore in numerous cases despite violence even experiencing positive memories with it . &quot;
&quot; thus , at most still the accus@@ ation still has to be looked at . &quot;
&quot; however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he just began to establish itself and was held by the events at a school that he was not engaged and responsible ( so the witness ) wanted nothing to hear , and then again to 1993 . &quot;
mer@@ ging Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently against the ears ?
&quot; Michael H@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the grammar school in which the report was even reproduced . &quot;
&quot; in that he pointed out that , &quot; &quot; in the pres@@ ch@@ ool , the test continues to be practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; already in view of the risk of negative media coverage , he recommended urgent inv@@ ading . &quot;
&quot; that was , of course , at a time when it was legal clarity , had long since been banned in Bavaria too . &quot;
&quot; before that , they occurred in a legal gray area , like everyone of us probably knows . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult for him to estimate correctly , where the sufferers may be exagger@@ ated or more dramatic , and where really the per@@ missible limits has been exceeded . &quot;
&quot; but one can not say , he could always have looked . &quot;
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the test for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said yes , it is unfair , the current educational standards apply to the then time . &quot;
how do you see this ?
Michael H@@ emann : we speak historians as from the &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; to evaluate today &apos;s moral principles .
there the princess had right .
&quot; but this does not , of course , not for sexual abuse who was ab@@ omin@@ able at all times and also not for what has been crus@@ hed at the primary school and violence against innocent children &apos;s sh@@ ri@@ mp@@ s , which goes far beyond that at that time . &quot;
this is all terri@@ bly and I am glad that it is finally being re@@ worked .
&quot; but at the same time Georg R@@ atz@@ inger must take shelter , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means to discipl@@ ining and punishment , so ear@@ chers and to pull together in hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; as physical punishment then , he was strictly forbidden . &quot;
&quot; which image of his Regen@@ sburger Zeit has reproduced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; My brother of Pope &apos; ? &quot;
did the topic check out also for the language ?
&quot; Michael H@@ emann : well , in the book I am talking about the life of his brother Joseph , thus Pope Benedi@@ k@@ ts XV@@ I. , tells out of his perspective , because the Dom@@ sp@@ ans played only a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I am by no means at all that he did a stric@@ ter rule there . &quot;
&quot; however , that must be said once again : without these perfection , without these perfec@@ tionist discipline , it would probably hardly be possible , from the until then rather nationally @-@ known Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen an institution of world tran@@ ts to form , true cultural bot@@ ies of Europe and its musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and bondage alone , one does not make a big singer and stand before every success , just in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
as what kind of people did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks on their book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through working on the book and in addition I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and always experienced as a wonderful , hum@@ orous , loving , deep unbeliev@@ ing and good people , from which one cannot imagine that he could do just a fly . &quot;
&quot; I get regularly with , like many former dom@@ es , still today , 23 years after its embar@@ ement , regularly contact him , visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who are not for@@ given him up to the present day , that he was strictly speaking to them , so are clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the estates are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music .
&quot; and that he always was a good , father@@ ly teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be , but he was also a lovely honour , to which she still look up and she will worship them . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clear : everything you need to pro@@ ach him , are education methods that were then on the order of the day . &quot;
we can be glad that we have recently overcome this time ago .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al scap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the wicked intention , which is behind it , just too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eved him . &quot;
&quot; now the dec@@ ency @-@ areas would have acquired a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who was acquired great merits , and probably no one else in Germany who would like to know the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen , finally in peace . &quot;
