<seg id="3">A pit chapel where now is buried for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the one-scale reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Munich promotes exciting stories to days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if land cards are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">"that knows everyone who had to look at this time, because the car-Navi took place instead of a circumference road a green meadow."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bavaria atom, an offer of the Pfoportas Bavaria of the State Government, are anything but topical - but it is very enlightening."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it is clear how cities and municipalities are changed in the spread-area of the Munich's area of Munich since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork of patchwork which one cannot recognise as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the large coverage map, for cities and communities, detailed maps, so-called primal blades, were incorporated."</seg>
<seg id="13">This arisen according to the Bayerischer surveying administration between 1810 and 1864 and skipping the first measurement of Bayerers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your Client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French Heereshijackers occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second World War Crimean War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and gave an topographical survey of Bayerns - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops went up with the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801, the present neighbors, which created the idea of a nationwide Bayern-card."</seg>
<seg id="18">"max IV. Joseph drove the project further, founded the" topographic Bureau "" - and thus the Bayerische surveying Administration. "</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urpositional Journal of Munich dates back to the year 1856 and is like all the other to be found on the Bayerischer Landeslibrary.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison morning / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"one example of this is subsendling, which appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was built 21 years after the map, thus 1877, as a Munich city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling is in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendlings focus around 1856 along today's Plinganserstrasse, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian peasants against Austria 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: in the first glance, a small percentage appears with dozens of lines and numbers: handwriting numbered Flurpieces from the so-called" "jungle" "which was derived from the basic tax."</seg>
<seg id="27">"even today, small plots do not occupy farmers more - but small gardeners of the plant" Land in Sun. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is characterised north of undersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, since 1810 locations of the October Revolution, was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the case of the present district of today Au-Haidhausen is not only read the street name" "At the Gaststag" "or from the ascent" On the air, "but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt. ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstrasse, you were once called people with madness."</seg>
<seg id="33">There was founded in 1858 / 59 the Münchner circle-Irrenaissance "On the Auer Lüisons."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard led the establishment of the establishment of King Ludwig's wife in connection with the death of King Ludwig's II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was advanced for his time and for example, ended the chains of the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he forbidden the staff to use violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the museum Haidhausen who has engaged himself for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients was first place, later on 500 seats were extended."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity is no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the gyearnest in hair 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"there have been the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-East, one of Germany's largest psychiatratriots in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="40">"at the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet young people in Munich's Salesianum."</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and walked in a youth-house with training establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">"located west is the football field of TSV Munich East, east residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015 the children of the house" "Casa Don Bosco" "was founded in architectural attack on the origin of the Irish Republic, who had been destroyed during the Second World War by bombing."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was listed around 1856 as" "main square", "the department was named" Kaufinger Gasse. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change to the Second World War in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies were split in December 1944 a lot of holes in the city center.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English institute, small business houses and a pit chapel from the Middle Ages were once stood at the Marienhof, where the first-breaking ceremony took place on April 5, 2017."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the sliders, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial photograph of today - and filling the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights group published traveler for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Union for the promotion of coloured coats has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri because of the discriminatory policy and the racist attacks of the state to Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Board for the federal state of Missouri, which should come into force up to 28 August 2017, call for special attention to visitors, visitors and Missouri, as a number of unquestionable, racial or-based incidents throughout the country, and here it is noted," says it in the opinion of the group. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law by Missouri, which makes it harder to win discriminality, as well as the prosecution bodies of the State, disproportionate to minorities, prompted the group to give the travel warning, the NAACP said."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of civil rights, people happen."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are halted because of their skin colour, they are put together or killed," "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star."</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear cases in such a frequency that we have not heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group quoted incidents like racist progo against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died in fragile circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no gasoline any longer during the journey by the state and was taken prisoner by the police of Missouri without having accused of any crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also pointed out a recent report by the office of the general state office of Missouri, in which it is shown that black drivers in the state are 75 per cent more common than whites."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware of and their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">People must be willing to bring it Caution or let your relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri promised a 100 hate crime in 2015 according to the latest figures from hate-hate reporting program of the FBI in relation to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">"the travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would make it more difficult to complain a company because of housing or employment discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil liberties Union (ACLU) had published travel arrangements for Texas and Arizona, after the states had to pledge to prohibious people because of immigration violations, which according to the ACLU will contribute to further reprovocation."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel arrangements are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in recent times, stakeholders have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Aunching project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fisherman Weideenchn project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Bundestag Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have drawn a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the recaphorst of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the fisherbacher CDU village met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann granted first insights into his operations, in which he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows, and also many young animals and housed in five apartments Feriengaeste."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "Black milk" "is for him the alternative marketer for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaeste is exclusively a regionally.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also called BLHV-president of Fisherbach, he designated the" "elementary project". ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not profitably farm on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green space for a lot of work, a lot of time must be edited using the motor sense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have been here with the conditions and with the topography," stressed Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the eleventh plant and generated this without any chemical plant protection and fertilisers, even if there is no bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider, the Commune was clear:" "the Commune has recognised the importance of the Weight project and is pleased with the Leader."</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, farmers had to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the reforestation of the areas could have been drawn up for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure that we have, are the people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how they continue their operation," "stressed the Mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism because of funding</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure area amounts to 40 hectares which can not be split up to at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">"of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of its leaders was promoted, a quarter carried by the municipality of fisherbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"therefore, the farmers love 12 610 euro, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of Weideenchn."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the life of the fences," explained Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and the housewives it does not go."</seg>
<seg id="90">"also for Peter Weiss stood firm:" "here, best food is produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscapegoism (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables state-of-the-defences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the disclosure of the Schwarzwalds.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of one of the LPR signed conveyms.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the tough surface should not be worse (Hangincline over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by forestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the fisherman Weight project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just 16 kilometers fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares, the Calabrian costs are more than 112 000 Euro."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now is the White House of Trump the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime Transition is when they start to push the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">"the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firm Square in Baghdad in 2003."</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump-regime, knew certainly what he did, when he accepted a symbolic Axt in a hitful dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of President of the drastic restriction on legal migration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to remain fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of jetties and Liberty-Imitators would have tried it out if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he laid hold of their significance, and in particular the meaning that you were attributed to, when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after completion of the monument, was added to its base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Abcosta:" I want to go here not to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illumines the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem which you relate to which later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is factually correct, but as he formed it ourselves, it is not really about story."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your poor, your poor, / Your pressing masses, who would like to breathe free, / the elding waste of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">"there has never been a time, in which the" "miserable waste" "was better to see on our screens."</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not committed to literary critic - he clearly did that those people in Trumps are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute: it is indeed a conflict of the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">"Lazarus and their friends, who put themselves in place to place their words after their death on the base, knew very well that they have accomplished a highly political act."</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicanism by representing the feminine portrayal of freedom in a abused classical exposition.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist Coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just like Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to switch it back for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the big cry, Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty was not to invite, but rather an early neo-conservative, who brings the American Flame into the converted world:" lady Liberty is proceeding. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It is intended to carry the Fackel of Liberty from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not be enlightened by the road to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here towards something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus insisted in seeing it as they were seen from the exhausted, miserable, yet hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"it is about the true sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people, seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"and that is of course not the perspective, the Miller and Trump will ever recognise."</seg>
<seg id="127">"your torch should not light the way, but the hatred, which is its only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle remembers a time when only two chins belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"the service director of the Leichantthletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-of-member contingent in the world team will contribute to a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 that will start on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "in Scotland develops special things" and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it. "</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will guide it until we find it out," said Black. "</seg>
<seg id="134">I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the guy on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - that can compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eiliie Doyle was elected by the team to team capacities."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"their captain's speech was amazing," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were chotted or where they live or train, went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling that Eiliie brought quite naturally, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth of Silver medallists who compete in their fifth World Championship in the 400-m hurdles, says that it is" incredible "is that 16 foots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's most total number of athletes during the world championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015. "</seg>
<seg id="146">"at the end of the year, the middle-winged muir leads to five British and two European records last year."</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rounds."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, the 1,500 m runs, is another shot that is included in the British team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers their first World Championship as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the Mannitts capitänin says that they are" hugely proud "of the fact that many of their compatriots belong not only to the team, but in some cases also with the medals and at the Finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"what is special about this team captain, is in fact that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway, but to know that my team-mates voted for me and chose to make it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all those who belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows only how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">"they are here to be established athletes, athletes, who want to rise to Podies."</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech is concerned as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think it went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">"so it is really important to put on this HED support, and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion."</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go there down and compete, and it'll just be such a great atmosphere out there."</seg>
<seg id="160">"blocking critic on Facebook: keep yourself not a public office, if you cannot wear the halves of voters."</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our land knew something of bad media.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long before the newspapers struck him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he mellowed the criticism, certainly."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not have his critics silenced.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783 Washington said:" "the freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we will lead to the sheep of the battles."</seg>
<seg id="166">"that brings me to Maryland about Governor Larry Hogan, who must work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan's employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on its official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil War refused this week since the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the stab of the Governors dismissed the lawsuit as frivolley, and the online comment was full of a reciprocal reaction with" "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is just Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important if it is a type such as Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">It has the two-highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hoganese is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very adept at making Facebook as the primary means to connect with his constituents and debating his hauneless head after chemotherapy in his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blocking of individuals who come to the Board of Governors, which is a public forum, which is officially designated as officially, and by employees who are to be paid by public tax dollars - needless and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post Bugans Sprecherin Amelia Chasse the actions of the Governors and argued that the comments of the comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hassertive people who vibrate the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are just real people, who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a pastor, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor took the Bible in his post and appealed to Hoose Catholic Faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"Lawytin Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hassertive, but she asked for hate crime."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate speech and gave other latest news, she wrote in the commentary in the commentary news" The Post. ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't even appreciate this idea if a number of people are on the same issue, then it is used by some rather than a so-called collective action and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the staff of the Governors expressed as" "concentrated" "spam attack, others would probably call" "intercession". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocked a critic or a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in former times when you had done the same that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical guidance, to burn or burn protesters and to silence."</seg>
<seg id="191">But that just happened just digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">"Hogan is not the first public official to criticize it, that he has implied Facebook and other social media."</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is dismissed by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell in Virginia last week.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County is the first Amendment, according to U.S. District Apostle James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they called a voters from their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) received a visit to the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington's time, Washington had a similar impact as the internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplies between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous mailbox stroke at its leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people used pseudonyme such as" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius "wrote all letters of newspapers that made Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions, who criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, the trade and navigation with Britain, mastered his ministry, according to the historical documents that were collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not have her silenced.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of expression, disagreement of disagreement and discourses belong to the foundation of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true guidance means to accept that.</seg>

<seg id="449">"in a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed that his about-face at Ozonstandards is simply the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfilling of the new standards."</seg>
<seg id="450">"among earlier administrations, the EPA has often been charged the deadlines for carrying out and then waited to establish an appointment for implementation," said Pruitt said the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job. "</seg>
<seg id="451">"we do not believe in regulation by judicial proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously."</seg>
<seg id="452">"we also take the law and authority, which gives us, seriously."</seg>
<seg id="453">"nevertheless, the opinion of the EPA that Pruitt sometime may use his" authority to delay and all the other legally available authority, "to make sure the rules are based on solid policy and the best available information."</seg>
<seg id="454">The Republican in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive reform of the ozone rules.</seg>

<seg id="459">"new York joined in this case California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsauia, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia."</seg>
<seg id="460">"soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil raffinsets, chemical plants and other sources are responding to sunlight."</seg>
<seg id="461">"the resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems with sensitive groups of people, and each year will help thousands of premature death cases."</seg>
<seg id="462">Representatives of the public health care and the environmentalists are cheered about Pruding surprising course change.</seg>
<seg id="463">"it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step by the responsible person for the protection of the air we inhale," said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity. "</seg>

<seg id="868">"I don't know how we are acting in Aue," says his coach of Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is confident about his cause, "because we just have in the three-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build well," said Hoffmann. "</seg>

<seg id="876">"now they can start the season virtually with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann believes that the players from Aue might be even something fresh because they couldn't have heaviest and complete play like Fortuna against an ascension of the bones. "</seg>
<seg id="877">"but they do not know as 100-percentage where they are at present," says the interior defenders of the Fortuna. "</seg>

<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resisted 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne's bags not packed and sold off their bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex at Knightsbridge in a much larger space," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I was looking for something, which was comparable to my price."</seg>
<seg id="1322">"this apartment was shown in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings."</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with them and made an offer on this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first inspection, the 1,000 square footage was completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a soldered layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne's storage room and mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, they commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, which was 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the blanket was not big enough to place two rooms to one another, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creative thinking to solve the default.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were overthrown over, without having to decorate."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about building a simple platform, but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This order enabled the fan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of extra drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine a classic copper window of Retrouvius can look down over the glamorous living space.</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold-furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille illumination put the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored, to make it last longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window to another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance we offer mirrored units space for all the seating and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">"thanks to the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can fill the kitchen when it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">What is special about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering art went in," explains Erfan of the steel reinforced, fury MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is very important, so it is when you push the door very easily, very easily."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne additional 16 m ² could win, an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the base sheet - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan. "</seg>

<seg id="1798">"Eric Cham, Expert of the Agricultural Research Institute of CRIEPPAM in Provence, said:" the Lavendel in Provence is effectively jeopardized because the plant in recent years has been exposed to the effects of climate change that has brought much less rainfall in the spring and in autumn much more.

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the employees of the Weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state of Sinhala by organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was communicated to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists are discussing what to feel safer: they should take their children to the office, which in 2009 were the goal of an attack with granates, or leave them home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"safety experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: enemies, Neutral, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporter to propose names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and abdomen."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drugs agency, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the secret list of government or cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no resting break from the violence, and while the corpses of the corpses, there are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took place in December 2012. 589 stood by attacks and threats under federal protection and up to now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter, her editors and their Inspirator from Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence associated with drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his lack is felt deeply, although its presence everywhere is present - a great photo of Valdez, which shows its midfinger with the word" Justice ", hanging onto the façade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry T-shirts, who show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death and the reporter discuss about their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although 2010 a Sonder-Bundesanwald was established to process the cases of journalists, according to the Committee aimed at protecting journalists only two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most of the thousands of murders, who are associated each year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely exposed to trial."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa although they are intritous and although the terrain is now even traitors."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting at the discussion of safety has little value, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very silly to squander my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know the Why, we mistrust all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed just to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car, and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - the" "Tweld river". ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The cap was driving away in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez has been 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to be able to wander freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans reation last year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions are fighting to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinhala every day someone or more people are shot on the road, or that the cemetery is full of dedicated, two-story mouse-oleans for drugs of drugs, which are bigger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget for a minute that there is a state of" tranquility, "if only a cartel control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"despite the fact that Valdez has become aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February the publication of a interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaling cartels in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this release may have been annoyed the sons, suspected power members purchased each copy of the output on, as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was to force Valdez, after the confiscation of another newspaper which had published the same story to leave the country its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez has been a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing will be considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived such a long time to imitate his friends and colleagues that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues for the foundation of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinhala," it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the dowry problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"in time, the newspaper earned a reputation for the bold and honest reporting, and the revenue and publicity."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporter loved it to be able to publish hard and accurate investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by one publication in which they were able to read stories."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" "for their coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez has won the" International Press Freedom Award "of the Committee to protect journalists from persecution of Mexican drugs history, wherever they were."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily to be afraid that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "" he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV in October last October. "</seg>
<seg id="1854">You will have to take the task that you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked," "What have you done in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what was going on?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"Riodoce team missed Valdez, the spawning bird, who was like a dockers, the friend who was generous with hugs and counties, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">You trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayas, the bar towards the office, go and always sit at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"well, ask them, was his love for routine his destruction?"</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced her to ask her own assumptions regarding how to best do their work and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it if you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their homework and cross-ways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells false, stay away. "</seg>
<seg id="1867">Said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that 'smell can be a sense of deceived... and then the thing happens with Javier.</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, apply in Sinhala - just as not as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisoned mix of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the space where the employees of Riodoce met for safety training, suddenly there were no mobile phones allowed. days previously was known that Spyware, which is sold solely to governments, used for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the State Government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-class district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the Scherz, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 per cent of policemen, who described the governor themselves as not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it has been a few months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are actually under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce has been blown into three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">It gave the assassination of brother of the former famous boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an Exposé to the state spending that focused on the hometown of the Governors.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group that resulted in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the Prosecutor's office."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was abducted or how it happened, so caution was advisable when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite locally of drug dealers and administrations."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"reporter took out of public records, that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who reigned over the entire century all political levels."</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several prei-governors have been accused of high-quality cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this pub, among them one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman went to a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"just a few months before, the reader had viewed the Columbus of Valdez, as the best informed source about kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"in the past we had already knew what is happening," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO" because of his slim physique. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication are crushed with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez has been devoted to storage space for signs and stickers, which are opposed to the murder of journalists, because the employees have become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">"reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs, and passed the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor."</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared 3 days, after being killed by Valdez, the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Throughout the country journalists have become soundprofied by rewritten in organized protests "SOS Press" on walkways and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day, the director Bojorquez is out in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez, accused the authorities, journalists to withdraw and bring it, because they said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"since then, she has asked that she is re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated their objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly told that journalists are in Mexico from organised crime, participating government officials and a" "valid society". ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco journalist, "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also by order of politicians and security guards which are organised with organised crime under a blanket."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"the media" "Articulo 19" "has more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials last year."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico stirring you because they want you disproportionate to the mouth," said Ramirez. "</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously the murders have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"your body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by Zetas-Kartell," here I am because of my reports. "</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer tastatur and earphones were next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branch have chosen to close as the newspaper El Norte at the northern border state Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondents Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue as it did El Manana from Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of their Director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010 the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the Drukartelle with an editorial on the title page with the title "What do you want from us?</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists are from their home-states or even out of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and search for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they will be hunted, like the photographer of Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered by four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who stay back and continue working, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be poets, gives to that drug trafficking is scared."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico is going to hell, and therefore I became reporter," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last edition was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat in front of the office and drank beer as at once all their phones began."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A number of shootings with tapirs and security guards in the vicinity of the bathroom Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">War escalated continued as promised by a series of Kartell messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">From the on-board edge you posted the news on the website of Riodoce about cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The cover page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens heels near - a further shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">"Bojorquez cast a look at the policemen, the guards held to see if they were in readiness."</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid of all, they did not show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the vast portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose medifinger was visible to all Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed its tracks."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you also only think about it," said Bojorquez, "if the same day was murdered by Javier, the practicant asked me to send it to the road reporting."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used camouflage to dodge his enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">At first sight it looks like a statue albeit a frightening.</seg>

<seg id="1928">"his unbelievably well preserved state has researchers, which describe it as" truly remarkable ","</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant-eater is the best preserved fossil fuel of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk when he was on 21 March 2011 at Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that was missing from the surrounding rock at the board, and decided to see more precisely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil was discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to expose the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy soil."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the ready result is ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blinzeln a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs, the Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found out that this herbal fresser, although it is covered with an armor, and resembles a changing tank, probably by meat-shakes dinosaurs threatened."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the highly armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a paratrocity that is known as antidding, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed to mix better in its surroundings and dodge his enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by major dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature dating from the family of Nodosaurier did the first time in May and is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and it Borealopelta markmitelli named after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7,000 hours with it."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"the amazing preservation of the copy made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of scales and armors over his body."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered counter-shutter, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the head of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter-variation is common, the results are surprising since the size of Borealopelta is far exceeds that of the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it points out that the dinosaurs was hunted by enough pressure by meat, even dinosaurs that the evolution of the confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most of the contemporary animals, which use the counter-attire - think of deer, zebras or Gürgents - are much smaller and vulnerable as loot, which signaled that this Nodosaur was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behavior on a massive, strongly armored dinosaurs demonstrate how dangerous the dinosaurs predators of the Cretaceous must have been", "Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skins also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs is brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate the animal on references to his life, including its consistent intestine to figure out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, went into a river and pushed into the sea, where he sank onto the back of the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely much more widespread than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaur is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preservative skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal," Brown said. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal today looks almost exactly the same as in the early Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just have a little bit with the eyes, you could almost believe that he is in sleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the Cretaceous was a time when huge Theropoden, carnivorous Dinosaurs, who stood on two legs standing up the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his furious ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanoptic rus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and have been painted in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum it is the most sophisticated dinosaurs in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average approximately 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1.300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">"it contained two 20-inch long tips, rayed by his shoulders."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the armored plant-eaters was flooded by the Western Canada, until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater inspection of the dinosaurs kept his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remnants of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still bumpy panels along the dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as' rare as a win in the lotus."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I see it, the more confuse it."</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy panels that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are downwards."</seg>

<seg id="2019">How a activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her heart.</seg>
<seg id="2021">"just one day after she arrived in New York City, sitting in St. Louis sat on the bed of an airbnb apartment that rented it and scroll through Facebook on their phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">They stumbled upon a post by someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police had just killed a 18-year child, and it is still on the street," says it there. "</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused, since no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly saving on her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the Rapper from the territory of St. Louis was involved, the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mon., killed live on tweet."</seg>
<seg id="2027">"he posted a picture of browns lebloated body, which was stretched on the road and staying there four hours."</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that is yes wild," said Ferrell. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She placed her cell phone in order to return to Tweet via people on the Canfield drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were pictures of the police band and people, the screamed, and of a man who claimed to be Browns's father, who wore a sign with the inscription:" Fergusons police has just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">They watched a live-feed with which a policeman was faced with a group of protesters with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, uninsured another policeman his rifle and cried:" I will kill you... I will all kill you. "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not usual," Ferrell reminded of her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">That is not the kind of murder we got used to and which we can have typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt shaking.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">You booked a flight back and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 23 o'clock, she fetched her father's daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets? "" in cinemas from the 11. "</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and the protest, love and loss of resistance, of strength and resistance, which consists of the sight of the people who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter, who carried a flower-dress and a suitable crown, the two went a conversation that she had countless times prior to this morning" about the black experience and the black condition. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember, how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "remember what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we now go to Ferguson, because the police had killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not bring it," said Ferrell later. "</seg>
<seg id="2046">That which is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">You have to know and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well designed, not only activism and organization, but also the various layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally has not experienced any blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would turn her a bad service to keep them away."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which was a camp for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets before and halted them to pass on protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began to embrace a new type of activism for the hectic form.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after 9 August," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"" "I had no experience in organizing."</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met for an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar, wanted to" document "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question was Ferrell in mind:" do you document, or try to find a story that you can exploit? "</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this scepticism was nourished by countless cases of men, often from whites - in a community that benefited from her sorrow and their resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan said recently in an interview:" "we heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson and have not raised their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan already worked together with the former co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field, known for his activism around Todestrakt."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought the project closer to Ferrell's project, along with six other locals followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years after Brought Ergo."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we talk," Davis said. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, because so I will be shown."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to concentrate on Ferrells' experience - to show that it deals with the movement" "not about a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most openin in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets "demonstrate their documents of" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferris life, as she loves themselves and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like sitting naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be certain vulnerability in this work and in the dehumanization of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrer's story repeated the role of black gay women in the wider black-lives-live movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the Movement, which after the killings of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 have shaped the film" BlacklivesMatter "in social media in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay men in managerial positions have carried the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are fighting in various fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay men must wear the main last of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to note that" "the movement is kept alive by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"it however, however, is that" this is not a affirmist type of action, "in which Ferrell has been selected as the heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is not a coincidence, although it was at the front front, because in a life of these crosses as a black, gay woman standing so much at stake."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years due to the blockage of a highway in a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area that they call their home: "a mess.</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless she clamated to a song, and she feels bound to this memory since she went into Ferguson for three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love each other and support.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">"from" "dream" "to" "size" ": TV reader discuss over bit-gallery"</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit-gallery moves the people even though it is still not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">"but the idea of a shopping center at the southward of the pedestrian zone splits since the first presentation of 2009, the population in proponents and opponents."</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold leaves the subject hardly any way.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page" "Population and Bitburg". ""</seg>
<seg id="2093">"for the one to say to the Bit Gallery:" this would be a dream ("" Anja Becker) or "" This would be real class "" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side, "" does not need a man "" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "" scale "" (Lars Scholz). "</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the advocates reproponents that a gallery draws more customers into the city, from which the other businesses will benefit, fear the opponents, that then the pedestrian precinct."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"added: the gallery is designed exactly on the property, on which the peasant hall is standing, in the 13 direct market market."</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the start of construction work will be finished.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Galerie makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and to a Beda-place finish with possibility of sitting outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Zimmer: "we've been buying a week in the farmers market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the cottages are always very happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher we discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">"we would like to see that during and above all, after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer."</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also this.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"above all, the small hall hall in Frankfurt is interesting."</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether there is direct market-market in a market hall in the gallery, comes to the amount of rent."</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, this should not be very low in the new project."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: what shopping Palace in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"clothes, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find that superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough of that in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many cargo transactions are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but here, however, there is not even a decent weekly market, it is all the more important that we at least get the market hall."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered is fresh, is largely offered by the producer and is also inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, shop stores are reserved only by major companies in a shopping centre, because the dormant are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, specialty shops are almost no more and what is left of it, will probably also disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping center with a Markthalle fit for me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Especially: where is the farmers market place during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even when the bit gallery will eventually occur.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it manage to sell all shops from Bitburg before?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it will simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which is empty, it also needs no one."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a peasant hall, it is thanks to the inscription many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg is no more space."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the peasant hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2124">An appropriate similarity: artist creates portrait with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost invisible - that hanging from the ceiling by the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfers and Haarlem which were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the earlier secret service Analyst sent a 35 year-year prison sentence, after she publicly made public messages over the WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on 2nd of August, A Becoming resemblance (A suitable similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was consolidating its expertise in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a Transwife and groundbreaking Dissier, whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has created by the algorithms analysis of DNA that could be extracted from Manning, how someone with these genomic data could look like someone with these genomic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the indurente determinants of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, including six breaches of the spy Act, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"through the prison, her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a granate, black-white selfishy, in which Manning is obviously sitting on a driver's seat and has a platformer stripe - with which she was associated with."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of her 2012-project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in that the artist portraits of strangers made of forensic artifacts like a cigarette stupid and chewing gum, adding the DNA out of the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg in a press show of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea, and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her detainted muse were gathered together in unequal glasses that have received several letters during the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic" Suppressed Images, "who would foresee a future in which the President chelated chelated judgment, and it would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released, Manning release after seven years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome type of blissful meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is even now at the opening of the exhibition a little bit far, and Starke, because Donald Trump lead a war against informants from the governmental camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweaked ways that he actually should fix, continue to inflame."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"as Dewey-Hagborg after the strange timing of all these things, she said that" "things happen" "for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"on the wall of the Galerie dated artistic statement called Manning with its surviving signature, among them (the" "i" "in their family name is provided with a heart) an end to the" automatic fragmentation, whose base is based on gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence, a thousandal of Cs and Gs and As, in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped, to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific dictionary, like amazingly similar, at least in organic ways, we all are."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people hopefully will take takes care of who we are and how openly genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories, also to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">DNA data can tell so many different stories so the 30 of these stories are.</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition is kept in one's own space, is a page from the above comic-Novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows men as she appears with a release-release efon in his hand from the disciplinarkasbarracks of the United States like King-Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"when they stand up your speech, then they have won," says it. "</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," "said the artist, who greet him out of Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get dawns, if I speak about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it should be foreseen in the comic book - but if they should do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, composed of their own genomic simulations, which together like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also focused, as everything was written in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Manning Statur), in which their genetic bucket-groups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a crowd of crowds," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it feels like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement, which also hidden behind their liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2294">What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hands.</seg>

<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes, based on an archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpectedly emotional."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only responded to the thumb button on the side of a letter, which has been written by a double-agent in the 1700-s, who worked for the Jacobins."</seg>
<seg id="2298">"that is his thumb pressure!</seg>
<seg id="2299">"and letters always smelled by smoke, for at that time one deformed a fire because of the light."</seg>

<seg id="2301">"I love archives!"</seg>
<seg id="2302">"for someone who is struck so with old papers, he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle (" To be honest: I said my welcome boy a little overvalued "), this all seems too beautiful to be true."</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle to explore the archives and study the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the Mongolian heads on the walls and the bottles that have spent centuries in the ditch. "</seg>
<seg id="2304">"he emigrated through the terrain and ruins of the old castle, and spoke with countrymen, gardeners, and sometimes also with artists who worked at the illustrations of his book."</seg>
<seg id="2305">"then, at night he drank" whiskey and began to write. "</seg>
<seg id="2306">"the intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust received its full access in 2006 as the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey."</seg>

<seg id="2309">Guys, let everything go his gear! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse on the broader base in the English history, including 'The Labourer', which leaves a man the newly built castle, to join the peasant uprising of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a recording of a turmoil that came up at 1380 in the castle, in this book entitled" Knizes "of Kent and Sussex '," says Rhodes. "</seg>

<seg id="2313">Maybe the two are connected? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">"other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', who tells the history of the Jesuit, who hid the family of Darrell seven years during the English Reformation."</seg>
<seg id="2315">"'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell is depicted in the 18th century, who filled his own funeral, by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was only years later turned out when its coffin was excavated)."</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes's favorite family of Scotney: "the gentlemen seemed almost indown to always do debt and spend money on things they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"other generations of Darrell-men provoked their debt crisis by keeping rich old women married, I imagine them as a pile of well-looking boys, with a talent to advertise profitability."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"after the end of his efforts at the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique write-experiences."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"he has brought a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Efookiki, the premises of a Sanatorio from the early 20th century, which has been reclaimed since then by nature."</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should worry</seg>
<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it cannot be more crazy, a new report about the technological developments in the field of sex robots."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, actually."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently published the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotik) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robot in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-founder of FRR, we must begin to take her ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye colour of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make themselves funny about them, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more frequently," "Mr. Sharkey said at the release of his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">"modern Sisters have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots, with a silicone, which feels warm to the touch of human reactions, which are achieved through artificial intelligence."</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can adjust his robot according to his beliefs," and thereby selecting everything from the eye color of the robot above the shape of the nipples up to the type or the color of its fingernails. "</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but there will be more disturbing, since many robots have the" personalities "that would make a stepford wife progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robots allows for example to adapt its users to the properties that find them appealing, such as relapsing."</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is still the Roxxxy Gold Sex-robot with pre-programmed personalities as "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of relapsing and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible," warms the site of true companion. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"she likes what you like, and she does not like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">She also has her moods over the day - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"it can be tired, be fixed to conversation or it can be" in mood. ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the lowest female features, the swelling of rape, if one is a step on Frigid (means here: contradicting) Farrah, is a quiet one on most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website the true companion Roxxxy with a vibration but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then not have Roxxxy?" it is said on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fairy or just another sex toys."</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and its increasing sophistication point out a little darker and deeper into our culture to retreat from the ideal of equal rights of the sexes to a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course take no sex robots, and while the FRR appears their rising popularity, they still remain provisional on the edge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what permeates from the edge-zones can be very instructive in relation to the spirit of time, in which we live, very instructive."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until they have the free market for this.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is however a certain overlapping that these highly developed sex robots are up at a time when the rights of women are threatened around the world, in which there is a president in the White House who has praved women sexually attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the deterrent aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphical images, the rounded body and the extinct eyes, but how realistic this vision acts."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind these sex robots is to establish a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (though with pornostar-proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">"they want their inheritance to be human, they feel humane to the movement of a real body."</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots do not represent real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They can not separate yourself from their companion or just go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no placement or a background history, nothing that indicates in independence or anything, which could disturb the fantasy of total submission."</seg>
<seg id="2422">Otherwise expressed: they are counterfeitful slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the phrases by 2017: maid</seg>

<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House is everyone who knows them, including the Republican Relationship, with whom she fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite odd on the same page."</seg>

<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help IBD (Inflamed intestinal disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in flesh-based proteins and dairy products, could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition in the USA affects approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 300,000, causing stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, loss of weight and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"during the sufferers usually get rid of meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the Washingtoner University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contribute to developing immune cells to promote a tolerant intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"leading researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immunoscels in the intestine patrol to make sure that harmful microbes that hide themselves in eating, do not penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are able to resolve inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging tissue."</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far towards inflammation tends to result from a inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments was found that a kind of tolerance conveying immune cell on mice occurs to carry a particular bacterium in their initiators.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the gems of proteins to trigger the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice in their food the more they had of these immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an on tryptophan was promoting a rich, lesser inflammatory bowel disease, if the same system is also with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that encourages tolerance, as it found out that a group of study forces had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was not separated."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"they suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbial of the mice, the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, who normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the Därme of mice were found DNA sequenia, and there were six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells, but without them lacking in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in an sterile setting so that they were missing an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop these types of immune cells and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cell.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria out to the immune system they left L. reuteri in a fluid and then transmitted little amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"the active component of the liquid has been cleaned, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan-Metabolism, known as an idol-3 milactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers dedouble the amount of tryptophan in feed the mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent, but when the tryptopict have halved, the number of cells sank around half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan is stated that people have the same tolerant cells like mice and that most of us reuteri protect us in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in people as they do with mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory boiling."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said:" "the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptopuses can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reuteri. "</seg>

<seg id="2731">"at the event, the President gave an impetus for the reform of the health reform that was in progress in the Senate, and he assures the efforts to suspend government regulations."</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen report drafted pope-brother Georg Ratzinger</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse of abuse of Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means the author and historian Michael Hemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the missive scandal over the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions on discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weissing, spokesman of the reform movement" We are church, "stated after publication against the German press agency, he, by the former Rainy Bishop and today Cardinal Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of Benedict XVI, an excuse."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would be very grateful to the prestige of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would express their profound ignorance about their own omissions or at that time incorrect assessment of processes."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the" "Osservatore Romano" "are criticized that in the reporting of violence at the Domspatzen will be measured with" two levels "." "</seg>
<seg id="2895">"regarding the assault in Regensburg, nobody knows that it would have to be prevented by" shamanic and shameful acts that would be punished and be prevented in the future; however, the "degree medial manipulation," says the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian, and member of the national Italian bioethic Committee. "</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of designate the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of the All-day experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal for normal", "writes Scaraffia."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk:" we are happy to go to the church, and this is a couple of frescoes. "</seg>
<seg id="2898">"in addition, she pointed out that in her youth" "Temge" "been a quite normal pedagogical means" "to be done with friends, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">It's unfair to use today's standards in previous decades because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports of the disabuse there is often the Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"wrongly, says author and historian Michael Hemann, who spoke with Ratzinger the reminder" "My brother of pope" "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I need to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "says Ezemann," "for all this had nothing to do with him," "he adds to the results of the final report."</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report submitted by the University of Regensburg with the Enlightenment attorney Ulrich Weber submitted?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s," with high platinum "victims of overprint, 67 domicatzen sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in summary report about Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, so that by Domkapellmeister R. has been applied in many cases forms of physical and psychic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be disastrous."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, contrary to numerous other accusations, many victims suffered the general Humanity of R., and therefore in numerous cases despite violence even associate positive memories with it."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hemann, why the final report on the abuse of abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger expressed his opinion in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-Pages report on the "incidents of violence perpetrated by the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a conflicting picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for one lift, many students highlight his" "humanity". ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as cholics and perfectionist who became tangible, when a domain name was musically not a top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate as his biographer this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hemann: when you are doing the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front until the rear, one has to wonder why the name of Georg Ratzinger does not exist at all."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just returned eight pages and he is clearly spoken of any suspicion of abuse or co-knowledge in the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">"also, the acts of violence at the pre-school, found themselves outside its efficiency."</seg>
<seg id="2916">"one can throw at it at all, to experience too late or have not taken the first hint seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzenging school on which he worked, was perceived by practically all respondents considered - so literally -" "salvation", "" "heaven" "and" better world. ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"thus, the vast majority of his pupils Georg Ratzinger makes a quite excellent testimony," "sincerely," "sincerely," "competent" "and" "understanding", "as extremely good-natured teachers who put the guys regularly with cakes, biscuits and bonbons and" always "of the grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about his perfectionist and his high emotionality, which also led to deserts. "</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he did not only crack with chairs and put the keyhole on the ground, but also earchers and too freeing guys pulled in hair or ears, he has already given years ago, deeply regret and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"salvation has to be said however, that such education methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, widely used, with parents as with teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeder methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think of each of us who was born in 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually in this report, namely the irreplaceable sexual abuse and the violence at the preschool, these are certainly dredging."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"you wonder whether it is not more familiar with his acquaintance and role as the brother of Benedict XVI, that many media just threw upon him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"at the Bavarian pope, many who have never understood him, are still eager."</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth is: the report gathered Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in connection with the report, the report was very much reported on the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger in the Final report also laid out any involvement or co-knowledge in relation to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No only of 67 victims of sexual assaults claimed to have become familiar to the domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I was never dared to speak with my father or mother over it," "said an itch substitute for the others," "It was all very embarrassing."</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the real problem of educating sexual abuse was and is, however, that most of the victims are silent."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they were not even parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir manager, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators as a colleague."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students Ratzinger role in regard to the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hemann: a surveyed student form it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no means in what he would have had (Georg Ratzinger) could have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective culprit.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for really absurd to suppose that all of it... beeing more pressing or clearer, or more likely to have opened as compared to their parents, internatories, trust instructors etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"the report comes to the very clear result:" that in advance, students and / or their environment were entrusted, could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"thus, it cannot be thrown to him not to prevent or have brought him to the ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore there is no reason to associate its good name with these contradictory crimes, as unfortunately in some cases it happened."</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media was a lot of "violence" at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger was thrown down in the report. "</seg>
<seg id="2947">Must he live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hemann: this is the big problem that in the coverage everything was mixed and mingled to a giant melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"however, this is in turn is a misuse of the report."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, it is clean: between the pre-school and the grammar school of the cathedral, between sexual abuse and violence, as well as, let's say once, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, so also for four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choir leader."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole terrible test of the pedagogy, the cases, in which lad from sadist teachers were downright and malate, and they were all accepted, eventful all at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous states have to prevail."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with whom, Domkapellmeister had nothing to do, because he got the boy to face, when they were already on the Domspatzenging school."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on the one hand, like most witnesses accentuate, the theme of" "pre-school" "taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the Domspatzenging school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hemann: since there was discipline already discipline but do not have sadist violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that" many victims are estimating the general humanity of R., and therefore in numerous cases despite violence even experiencing positive memories with it. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"thus, at most still the accusation still has to be looked at."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"however, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he just began to establish itself and was held by the events at a school that he was not engaged and responsible (so the witness) wanted nothing to hear, and then again to 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Merging Georg Ratzinger consistently against the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the grammar school in which the report was even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in that he pointed out that," "in the preschool, the test continues to be practised." ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">"already in view of the risk of negative media coverage, he recommended urgent invading."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"that was, of course, at a time when it was legal clarity, had long since been banned in Bavaria too."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they occurred in a legal gray area, like everyone of us probably knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult for him to estimate correctly, where the sufferers may be exaggerated or more dramatic, and where really the permissible limits has been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but one can not say, he could always have looked."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the test for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said yes, it is unfair, the current educational standards apply to the then time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hemann: we speak historians as from the "pitfalls of anachronism" to evaluate today's moral principles.</seg>
<seg id="2975">There the princess had right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this does not, of course, not for sexual abuse who was abominable at all times and also not for what has been crushed at the primary school and violence against innocent children's shrimps, which goes far beyond that at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all terribly and I am glad that it is finally being reworked.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time Georg Ratzinger must take shelter, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means to disciplining and punishment, so earchers and to pull together in hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"as physical punishment then, he was strictly forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"which image of his Regensburger Zeit has reproduced Georg Ratzinger because in the talks with you for the book" "My brother of Pope '?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the topic check out also for the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hemann: well, in the book I am talking about the life of his brother Joseph, thus Pope Benedikts XVI., tells out of his perspective, because the Domspans played only a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I am by no means at all that he did a stricter rule there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"however, that must be said once again: without these perfection, without these perfectionist discipline, it would probably hardly be possible, from the until then rather nationally-known Regensburger Domspatzen an institution of world trants to form, true cultural boties of Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and bondage alone, one does not make a big singer and stand before every success, just in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">As what kind of people did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks on their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through working on the book and in addition I met Georg Ratzinger really well and always experienced as a wonderful, humorous, loving, deep unbelieving and good people, from which one cannot imagine that he could do just a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I get regularly with, like many former domes, still today, 23 years after its embarement, regularly contact him, visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who are not forgiven him up to the present day, that he was strictly speaking to them, so are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the estates are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he always was a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be, but he was also a lovely honour, to which she still look up and she will worship them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clear: everything you need to proach him, are education methods that were then on the order of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have recently overcome this time ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the wicked intention, which is behind it, just too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just published, relieved him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the decency-areas would have acquired a 93-year-old man who was acquired great merits, and probably no one else in Germany who would like to know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
